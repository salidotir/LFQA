Why do old games running on new hardware still have technical issues?,"Because there's a lot of things to consider when developing a game. There are many many different hardware configurations and software configurations and you can't possibly test them all. So when you're developing a game you have to make a lot of assumptions about the hardware and software that it will be running on. If you make a game that is too complex or too demanding for the hardware it's running on, it will have problems. If you make a game that is too simple or too lightweight for the hardware it's running on, it will have problems. So the question is, how do you know what the right level of complexity is? You can't know for sure, because the hardware and software that it will be running on is not known until the game is released. And once it's released, it's too late to change it. The only thing you can do is make a game that is as simple as possible, but still has the features and gameplay that you want. You have to make some assumptions about what the hardware and software will be like, and hope that they will be good enough. But it's possible that the hardware and software will be so bad that the game will be unplayable. That's why you hear stories of games being released and then being pulled off the market because they don't work properly.","The XBox is emulating NES hardware and running the emulation at a set speed. If it ran it at as fast as possible, then it would be several times faster than the original NES game and would be unplayable. I can't speak for Mega Man exactly, but older games tended to run on a cycle locked to the screen refresh which was a fixed 60Hz or 50Hz. There was only one piece of hardware they ran on, so there was no need to adjust for different hardware speeds. In that case, it's probably on purpose - they want to emulate the experience as closely as possible, even including the slowdown and sprite flickering. Some emulators let you turn it off, but it's usually turned on by default. In other cases, like if you're trying to emulate PS2 games on your PC, the game might just run really slow in general. Even though your PC is way more powerful than a PS2, it has to ""translate"" from PS2 language to PC language in realtime, which is much more difficult than running PS2 code on the PS2 itself.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 31.3, 'recall': 40.74, 'fmeasure': 35.4}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.49, 'recall': 5.85, 'fmeasure': 5.08}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.41, 'recall': 17.46, 'fmeasure': 15.17}}"
Why are electrical lines slack between poles?,"Because of the way the electricity flows. Electricity is a current that flows from a negative terminal to a positive terminal. The electricity is not stored in the wires, but flows through them. The wires are not there to hold the electricity, but to allow it to flow through. The electricity flows in a straight line, and the wires are designed to allow the electricity to flow in a straight line. The wires are slack, so that the electricity can flow through them easily. If the wires were tight, the electricity would not be able to flow through them as easily.","Because if they were pulled taut, then a strong wind could bend the poles away from each other and snap the lines, loosing high energy power lines onto the ground below which can be extremely dangerous. A little bit of slack is just fine. There are a few reasons. First, they're metal. Metals expand and contract with heat--if there was no slack, they'd possibly break under extreme temperature changes. Second, birds and debris sometimes land on them. You need them to be able to take some weight, which means they can't be stretched too tight. The lines have mass. So there is something that needs to hold them up. Any force is composed of a horizontal and a vertical force. And a line under tension have a force following the line. So in order to keep the line up you need a certain force up on each pole in addition to the horizontal force. You could increase the horizontal force which would make the line more straight but it would still have some slack in them. You can not get rid of it. The amount of slack in a power line is a compromise between the force that can be applied to the lines before they or the poles snap in wind and how tight the lines have to be to not hit each other or the ground.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.43, 'recall': 25.0, 'fmeasure': 34.83}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.0, 'recall': 2.6, 'fmeasure': 3.63}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.72, 'recall': 12.07, 'fmeasure': 16.82}}"
"It's been 12 years since the tallest roller coaster was built. Is there a limit to roller coaster heights, or what is the reason why there hasn't been more competition?","There is no limit to how tall roller coasters can be. The limit is in the strength of the steel used to build them. Steel is strong, but it isn't infinite in strength. The higher you go, the thinner the steel needs to be to support the weight of the track and the cars. As the steel gets thinner, the strength of the track gets weaker. The higher you go, the more energy the track needs to absorb to keep the cars safe. The higher you go, the more energy you need to store in the cars themselves. The higher you go, the more air there is in the atmosphere, and the more air the cars need to push through. The higher you go, the more the track needs to be shaped to keep the cars on the track. The higher you go, the more the track needs to be smoothed to keep the cars on the track. The higher you go, the more the track needs to be reinforced to keep the cars on the track. The higher you go, the more the track needs to be inspected to keep the cars on the track. The higher you go, the more the track needs to be maintained to keep the cars on the track. The higher you go, the more the track needs to be replaced to keep the cars on the track.  ","It's really about cost and safety. Look at the example of Drachen Fire coaster in Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, Virginia. It was a fast steel coaster that ran from 1992-1998. It has a 150 foot drop, reached 60 mph, and had a special double bend that produced a split-second of zero-gravity effect. The problem was that the ride was very rough and many injuries ensued. Shortly after opening they told people to remove earrings because of the number of cases of them being ripped out of ears as a result of the ride. Busch Gardens had to disassemble Drachen Fire in 1998 at a considerable loss. It's not just physics, but safety that matters as well. There's no limit in principle to the height a coaster can be built. Arrow's proposed [fishhook coaster]( URL_1 ) would have been 750ft high if it had ever been built. The [Polercoaster]( URL_0 ) currently proposed to be built in Florida would be over 500ft high. The primary reason why the height record hasn't been broken since 2005 is economic. Large coasters are very expensive to build, record breaking ones even more so. There aren't that many parks large enough that they can justify the cost. It's probably twofold: (1) The economy sucks. Theme parks are a bit of a luxury good - > people are less inclined to pour money in to them during hard times. (2) I'm pretty sure that whilst not technically impossible to build bigger rollercoasters, the cost gets exponentially higher as you get bigger. Would not at all be surprised if a rollercoaster 20% taller than the biggest one right now is like 100% more expensive to build. TL;DR: $$$","{'rouge1': {'precision': 23.4, 'recall': 18.97, 'fmeasure': 20.95}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.56, 'recall': 2.08, 'fmeasure': 2.29}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.32, 'recall': 12.41, 'fmeasure': 13.71}}"
What exactly IS a belt drive motor?,"A belt drive motor is a type of motor that uses a belt to transfer power to a shaft, rather than using a gearbox. Belt drives are commonly used in industrial and commercial applications, where a gearbox would be too expensive or large. They are also used in a lot of small electric motors, such as the motor in a lawnmower. A belt drive motor consists of a motor, a pulley, a belt, and a shaft. The motor is connected to the pulley, and the pulley is connected to the shaft. The motor rotates the pulley, which causes the belt to move, which in turn causes the shaft to rotate. The shaft is connected to a load, which is the object that the motor is powering. Belt drives are very efficient, because the belt can transfer power directly from the motor to the load without any losses. They are also very simple, which makes them inexpensive and easy to maintain.","A motor with a pulley and a belt which drives another pulley. The alternative is direct drive. That can include drive via gearing, shaft, friction wheel, or other. It's not a thing. The motor drives a belt, which drives what you want to move.

"What is this ""Split Bolt"" for and why is it 15 thousand dollars?"," I have no idea what the ""split bolt"" is, but I'm assuming it's a piece of metal that is used to split something else in half. I'm guessing it's used in a machine of some sort. As for why it's 15 thousand dollars, it's probably a very specialized piece of equipment that is only used in one specific industry. It's probably made of some very expensive material, like titanium, and is used to split something that is very hard to split. Maybe it's used to split a very hard rock, or something like that. I'm guessing it's some kind of industrial machine that is used to split something in half. It's probably used to split something like a bolt, which is a piece of metal that is used to hold things together. It's probably used to split the bolt in half so that you can use the two halves to hold two things together. It's probably made of some very expensive metal, like titanium, and is very hard to split. Maybe it's used in a machine that makes things like airplanes, or something like that.","Everybody else is right as to what it's for, maybe I can help with the price. Sometimes, a company encounters a situation where they need exactly this very component, as soon as humanly possible, or else they stand to lose a ton of money. So occasionally you can find vendors listing fasteners for ludicrous prices on the off chance that happens. If they have the last one, you buy it.

They are just industrial wire connectors and I can not understand those prices.

What are the benefits of a smaller processor nm? like from 32nm to 14nm to 10nm?,"The phone has a speaker in it. The speaker is producing sound, but the sound is being dampened by the pocket. The sound is then being amplified by the buzzing of the phone. It's similar to when you have a speaker in a room and the sound is dampened by the walls.","Were able to achieve a smaller size only due to the finer resolution that we can make the individual pathways on the silicon that makes up the CPU. The smaller size means that electrons have to travel less distance and use shed less power in resistance to do the same work. None of the other replies really get to the heart of the matter. The main reason why smaller feature size is better is because a guy named Dennard discovered that the smaller features on a processor, the faster the clock speed can be. This known as Dennard scaling: URL_0 This often confused with Moore's Law, which states that transistor density doubles every 18 months or so. While they are different laws, they are obviously related, since Moore's Law predicts the rate at which features will shrink, and Dennard says that smaller features are faster. Another reason for smaller features is that improves the yield of silicon wafers used to make processors, and therefore reduces the cost of making processors. For example, every silicon wafer will probably have a few defects in it. If a processor was so large that it used a whole silicon wafer, it would be difficult to ever make a processor without defects. Now if you can fit two processors on a single wafer, the odds of one of those processors not having a defect just went up. Now take this example to the extreme. Say you have a wafer with 3 defects on it, but you can fit 100 processors on it, because they're so small. You now have made 97 usable processors from a single silicon wafer, increasing your yield, which decreases your cost per processor. Now that you have increased your yield and reduced costs so that you can sell enough processors to make a profit, you can continue to reduce feature size and use that to add more features to your processor ( like caches, vector registers and additional floating point units) while keeping the processor size constant, which should keep yield constant. The nm number is a measure of how small they can make the components on the chip. Smaller numbers mean that the transistors and other components are smaller. This in turn means that more can be packed into a given area, or making a chip with a given number of transistors will be smaller. This is one of the main benefits. If we suppose that the processors in typical computers have up to 10 cm^2 of space, then smaller components (smaller nm) means that more cores can be put into that space or cores with more additional circuitry. That additional circuitry can come in real handy. For example, being able work with more floating point numbers (binary equivalent of real numbers with a decimal point) in parallel at once in math operations. Or being able to calculate common hash functions and cryptographic functions in hardware instead of software resulting in a massive speedup for anything using them (say, browsing a website using TLS/SSL). Or making various processor instructions more efficient (taking less clock cycles to compute). There are a few downsides. As the components get smaller, the insulation between the wires and the parts of the electronic components gets thinner. As the insulation gets thinner, it leaks more electricity which wastes power and generates heat. The bad news is that at these sizes, reducing the thickness of the insulation by a factor of two doesn't double the leakage. It increases a lot more than double. The reason for this is that at these scales, quantum tunnelling of electrons through the insulation starts to become important and the rate of that increases very steeply as the insulation gets thinner.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.49, 'recall': 4.96, 'fmeasure': 9.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.54, 'recall': 0.96, 'fmeasure': 1.78}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 43.4, 'recall': 3.68, 'fmeasure': 6.78}}"
Nikola Tesla's plan for wireless electricity," Wireless power transmission was Nikola Tesla's life's work. and he was one of the pioneers in the field. Tesla’s idea was to create a system of coils that would allow electricity to be transmitted wirelessly over long distances. Tesla had been working on this idea since 1893 and had made a number of important discoveries. He had discovered that electricity could be transmitted wirelessly by using a high-frequency alternating current. He also had developed a new method of measuring electrical potential. Tesla was convinced that his system could be used to power homes, factories, and even cities. He believed that his system would be safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly than traditional power transmission systems.   waves. The radio waves would be transmitted through the air to a receiver which would convert the waves back into AC power. Tesla believed that he had discovered a way to harness the energy of the Earth itself, and that his system could be used to power the entire planet. He believed that his system would be safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly than traditional power transmission systems.  ","To make current (flowing electrons) in a wire, you need a magnetic field moving across that wire (you can also have the field stay pit, and move the wire, relative motion is the key). Magnetic field do not travel very well though. They dissapate very quickly the further you go. An electromagnetic wave, on the other hand, will travel much further. The electric part of the wave reinforces the magnetic, and vice versa. The key problem, is that the power of the wave drops off with distance. Given a transmitter of a fixed amount of power, say 100 watts, at 1 meter from the transmitter, that 100 watts is divided across a sphere that has a surface area of ( 4 * pi * r^2 ) call it 12 square meters. At 2 meters you have 48 square meters to divide the 100 watts. At 3 you have almost 120 square meters of surface are to 'fill' with the same amount of power output. Tesla thought you could overcome this drop off by using resonance. If the field vibrated at the same frequency as the earth/atmosphere system, the transmission efficiency would be greatly enhanced. As far as anyone is aware, he was not able to make this work on a large scale. People here keep referencing the tesla coil as his method of wireless power transfer. While partly true that was not his complete idea for low loss wireless power transmission across large distances. Most Tesla's ideas involved constructive resonance through a medium. Tesla's idea was to use the earth and atmosphere as a medium. He believed that he could use the earth itself as a conductor by taking advantage of resonant frequencies and using the atmosphere itself as to complete the circuit. Essentially people would put a wire into the ground and a second ""antenna"" up into the air and they could power their home without wires connecting to a grid from his power station towers. Wikipedia has a nice, imho, simple [eli5 explaination]( URL_0 ) I will leave here: ""The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allowing alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance it at any point on Earth with very little power loss.[116][117][118] His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would ""break the air stratum down"", eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit.[119][120] Tesla would go on the next year to propose a ""World Wireless System"" that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide[121][122] and attempted in 1901 to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called the Wardenclyffe Tower, at Shoreham, New York. By 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed."" Several of the explanations here are wrong. Beware! :) As Tesla kept saying and saying, *it wasn't radio. It had nothing to do with radio. The inverse-square law did not apply, because radio waves weren't being sent from an antenna.* He wasn't using his giant Tesla coil in radio-transmitter mode. He wasn't broadcasting his waves into outer space like Marconi did. Anyone insisting differently, they're simply wrong, and remain clueless about Tesla's actual plans. But, they're wrong for good reason. It's because Tesla kept secrets. Today we know quite a bit because Tesla did give many details in a private 1916 legal deposition (Marconi radio court case,) but that wasn't published until 75 years later. Much else being said about Tesla's wireless system was either uninformed speculation, or was taking Tesla's furtive and semi-misleading comments about secret inventions as being complete explanations. Before 1992 you had to go to the Tesla Museum if you wanted to know the truth. Instead, most authors just made s & 't up about Tesla. Or, they lifted their information from earlier books which made s & 't up about Tesla. Unfortunately, all this wrong speculation ended up in books. And if books clearly state Tesla's wireless plan, it must be true? And it's even more true when many books say the same thing? Nope. That's pure BS. It's ""game of telephone"" where books repeat earlier books with distortion, and the info in earlier books came from even earlier ones. And the original info was speculation to begin with! Instead, read original Tesla docs with Tesla's actual statements (which remained inside the Beograd Tesla Museum until finally published by Leland Anderson 1992 ""[Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy...]( URL_0 )"" --- Ok ok, *WHAT WAS TESLA'S PLAN?* It was very simple: make a conductive path all the way up to the top of the sky, to the conductive ionosphere layer. Then power the ionosphere with a fifty million volts power supply, as if the entire sky was one giant plate of a capacitor. The ground serves as the other plate. The sky-plasma was his power-line, with the Earth being the return conductor. Giant tesla-coils with 100 megavolts on the upper terminal would create the vertical ""plasma tower"" to conduct current to the sky itself. They'd also supply power to every Tesla-type power-receiver on Earth. Very cool idea: we're in the gap of Tesla's giant capacitor, the size of Earth's atmosphere. It's as if all of human society was placed inside a microwave oven operating at low frequency. Hold up a fluorescent tube, and it glows wirelessly, anywhere on Earth. (Well, his planned power level wasn't high enough for that. Tube-lamps would need a few yards of vertical antenna and a small coil before it would glow wirelessly.) One engineering paper in the 1980s estimated that such a system would consume a millon watts entirely in wasted energy, but these losses would be constant. That means 10 megawatt system would be 90% efficient, while a 100MW system would be 99% efficient. Note that large power grids tend to be under 70% efficient < edit, wrong might be more like 94% > Only one problem. HOW THE EFF DOES SOMEONE MAKE CONNECTION TO THE IONOSPHERE? Carbon-fiber space-elevators?!!! Tesla said he would ""break down the atmosphere"" between his tower-electrode and the conductive layers far above. So, a lightning bolt. Only needs to be 30KM tall. Roughly. So, all the Tesla-skeptics were never able to properly scoff at his wireless-power system. Tesla had them all gnashing and frothing about inverse-square falloff and near-zero efficiency, when his system actually wasn't using radio waves at all. It was an invisible power line, an odd type of beamed-power using plasma. They should have been scoffing about Tesla's ability to create the 30KM vertical spark needed for his system to work. Well, spark, or a glow-discharge. * [Artist conception of Tesla's system in operation]( URL_1 ), from 2001 Serbian-language book from the Tesla Museum. * [Tesla's lab-scale protoype of Wireless Power xmission]( URL_0 #Section_7), build for Patent model From the above diagram with the glass tube, we see that Tesla's system was based on conducted currents in glowing air, not on radio waves. Those current paths would glow at night. It was only ""wireless"" in the way that neon signs are ""filament-less."" In modern words, Tesla was going to use tens of kilometers of glowing plasma as his power grid. Interesting trivia: when Tesla was discussing this in an interview, the reporter said why not just guide your lightning discharge up to the sky using ultraviolet spotlights. Tesla changed the subject! Decades later Tesla said that the UV spotlights placed atop Tesla Coils were his first goal, but he then tested it and found that the discharge-length remained far too short. He abandoned the carbon-arc searchlights, and instead discovered another method which he claimed was successful, and he'd fully tested it on his giant coils at Colorado Springs. A side-effect would be to make the entire sky above the transmitter glow like a vast Aurora. He never said what this method was. Later he changed his mind about making it public, because he said it had major weapons possibilities. It could ""render uninhabitable"" any selected spot on Earth. ""It would be like giving a knife to an infant."" Whatever was the trick was, or, whichever way Tesla was fooling himself, he took the secret to his grave. Therefore, don't laugh about Tesla's system being ""too inefficient,"" or because ""Tesla didn't even know about inverse-square law."" That's just ignorant. Instead, laugh at Tesla for suggesting that he'd actually excited the Earth's entire ionosphere using a vertical gas-breakdown path many tens of KM tall ...late at night out in Colorado, so nobody would see the sky-glow aurora effects it created. *I saw that I would be able to transmit power provided I could construct a certain apparatus -- and I have, as I will show you later. I have constructed and patented a form of apparatus which, with a moderate elevation of a few hundred feet, can break the air stratum down. You will then see something like an aurora borealis across the sky, and the energy will go to the distant place. ...I came to the conviction that it would be ultimately possible, without any elevated antenna --- with very small elevation --- to break down the upper stratum of the air and transmit the current by conduction.* -N. Tesla 1916 Well, one thing's certain. Tesla was exactly right in insisting that, it wasn't radio. It wasn't practical, sorry to say. A Tesla coil is essentially a huge radio transmitter, with no content, typically in the 2-100KHz range but it's unclear what frequency he was planning to use (plans may never have been settled to that level of detail). A normal radio receiver gets tuned to match the frequency of the radio transmitter and collect as much power as possible, but still, the signal is TINY (not enough to light an LED) and all the power to drive the speakers comes from the receiver's battery driving an amp. Even though the radio transmitter is tens of thousands of watts. Tesla really didn't have anything new in that regard, but fantasized about impossibly huge radio transmitters and bigger receiver antennae. There are many aspects which don't make sense here: 1. The radio transmitter would have to be fantastically huge for anyone to receive a useful amount of power, even right next to it. It would be very inefficient and power ain't free. 2. Strong RF flux is actually known to be *dangerous* to people and the environment. OSHA sets a limit of 10 mW/cm^2. The power levels needed to light a lightbulb are comically above that. 3. It would not just be received by the intended antenna, it would be picked up in the wires of any circuitry not shielded in a metal box. It would cause massive interference. 4. You could receive more power with less RF flux, but the antenna must be huge. If you have an antenna spread out across an acre to receive a few watts from a transmitter 1/2 mile away at 0.0001% efficiency, why wouldn't you just run a wire to the power source? You may have heard the claim ""a major breakthrough in 1899 at Colorado Springs by transmitting 100 million volts of high-frequency electric power wirelessly over a distance of 26 miles at which he lit up a bank of 200 light bulbs and ran one electric motor!"" Also listed as 50W bulbs, 10kW. That ""fact"" showed up in a 1944 biography of Tesla written by John O'Neill. There is NO source for the claim, in fact O'Neill was NOT a proper historian and said a lot of shit which doesn't correlate with history. Tesla took meticulous notes at Colorado Springs and he never documented anything like that. No one other than O'Neill said anything like this. Some people think ""well Tesla was being too secretive to record it, because it might be stolen"" but that's nothing like Tesla. Tesla was desperate for funding and into *grossly inflating* his claims. No one could ""steal"" his work, he was too far ""out there"" for others to even try to replicate. One theory someone came up with: ""It is interesting to note the 1909 American Encyclopedia cites the first commercial transmission of AC on November 17, 1896 was from Niagara Falls to Buffalo, N.Y., a distance of 26 miles. Could this have been the historical event after which the questionable 26 mile Colorado Springs figure was derived?"" Plausible, IMHO. O'Neill was a kind of a confused guy. Imagine you are on a trampoline. Around the edge, you put marbles. In the center, you drop a bowling ball. When it hits the tarp, the bowling ball makes all the marbles on the outside edges move. If you could dribble the bowling ball, or bounce it just right, you could get the outside marbles to move repeatedly. The bowling ball is the tower, and the marbles are receivers. Basically tesla ""bounced"" energy in that tower, and the marbes felt it and were affected by it at a distance. The problem is that tesla wanted to make the trampoline *really* big, so big that the marbles would be too far away from the bowling ball to feel it. *** I stand corrected- I'm talking more about a tesla coil system here, where it appears the question was about his atmospheric power system. Refer to /u/wbeaty answer as I think that is more accurate. My answer applies more to wireless power via electromagnetic waves, wheareas his is more about making the sky and earth into a giant conductive sandwich. To my knowledge the Wycliffe tower was intended to be a tesla cool type system, but I do not know for sure. A Tesla coil when Tesla was building them, wasn't about generating lightning, the lightning was an unwanted side effect of his transmitting coil. A Tesla coil is like a swing, but with electromagnetic fields instead of mass, gravity and a pendulum. Energy is pumped into the coil at its resonant frequency, and like a swing set, swings further and further as you add energy at its resonant frequency. These swings of the electromagnetic energy sends out electromagnetic waves through the air. Tesla coils are very efficient at generating electromagnetic waves. Back in Tesla's day, electricity in the home was all about lighting. There weren't many home appliances and industry mainly still used diesel, steam or water for powering their machinery. With fluorescent lighting, energy put into the tube causes it to emit uv radiation. That radiation hits the white phosphorus coating in the inside of the tube and is absorbed and re-emitted as visible light. In the electromagnetic field given off by a Tesla coil, the tube will also give off light. Tesla wanted to build absurdly large Tesla coils to light up fluorescent tubes at huge distances instead of running wires from the generating station to homes. Tesla believed that a spherical conductor (i.e. The Earth), can support *surface waves*. They look a little [like this]( URL_0 ). They hug around the outer surface of a conductor, and in the case of the Earth would continually diffract around it. Surface waves (also called creeping waves, ground waves, Sommerfield-Zenneck waves) do exist. He thought he could transfer power around the Earth using these waves - exciting them using his Tesla coil. It would create a standing wave around the Earth -the waves would be emitted from his transmitter, go around the Earth, converge at the anti-pode, and then come back. If you know anything about standing waves, they are caused by a transmitted and reflected wave, which is what would happen here. Imagine a guitar, the strings are the wardencliff tower and the guitar body is the earth. When the string is played it resonates within the body. The earth would resonate the power through the ground so it could be extracted at a distant location. In one way, radio transmission is a form of wireless power; after all, a crystal radio is powered purely by radio waves, without external amplification. Of course, by the time it reaches you, the signal is very weak indeed. Signals from Wardenclyffe going through the ground would also experience huge losses. Tesla also misunderstood the properties of electromagnetic waves. Make air electric so all electric things are powered by the air (hope this was a good ELI5, it seems many explanations tend to be ELI have a reasonable background in the topic and am around 20 and might not help the person for what they want) Today we know electricty is caused by the sharing of electrons between a conductive material (copper wire). Tesla on the other hand thought that electricty came from an invisible 'Ether' in which electrons are a free floating entity in space not attached to any atoms. He thought that by pumping electricity into the ground via the Wardenclyffe tower he would be able to send energy all over the world. Turns out he was just connecting to the largest ground system known to man and disscharging all of his electricity into the earth. His Tesla coil does work for sending electrical energy wirlessly but it is not usefull for our needs. Imagine connecting a computer to WiFi and having the option to plug in an ethernet cable. In the simplest terms, electricity moving through a wire creates a magnetic field around it. If you wrap the wire around into a coil, that field gets stronger. (this is the basic principal upon which electromagnets and electric motors operate) Similarly, the opposite is true as well. If you introduce a magnetic field to some wire, it will induce electrical current in the wire. (technically the change in magnetic field, but that's not super important for an ELI5 explanation) This effect is stronger with more ""coils"" of the wire. (this is the basic principal upon which generators operate) So, to transfer power wirelessly, you just send a high frequency (meaning many times per second) alternating current (means polarity switches back and forth from positive to negative over and over) through a coil of wire, and put another coil close enough to be in reach of that first coil's magnetic field, and boom, you have transferred power wirelessly. Tesla had the idea of scaling this principal up to a HUGE scale. I'm five days late to this question, and there are already a few good answers, so I assume no one will see this, but a big part of the complication in understanding Tesla's wireless power system comes from the fact that his wireless power system combined two very different systems. The first was a wireless power transmission system that used the earth as a resonator for ELF-VLF 'reactive' 'quasi-superconducting' energy transmission (for up to ~30 kHz), and the second part was a solar wind energy harvesting system. These systems were completely independent inventions, but he intended to combine both ideas in his global tower system. [Wardenclyffe]( URL_13 ) was supposed to be only the first of many such towers. The first system was apparently his single-wire power system but using the layer of water (groundwater, lakes and oceans) as the resonator instead of a transmission line. The solar wind energy harvesting system was later developed in a much more limited local form using metal balloons instead of towers by Estonian inventor Hermann Plauson of the Fischer-Tropsch Otto Traun Research Corporation. Plauson is apparently better known as the inventor of the colloidal mill for making asphalt. Plauson put a lot of effort into developing this atmospheric energy tech for many years before patenting it in 1921 ([US Pat. No. 1,540,998]( URL_12 )). People found some things Tesla said about the combined wireless system impossible like especially how much power he said was available. In 1904, Tesla said he could produce 6 million households of energy from Wardenclyffe consuming only 6 households of energy—produce a 7.5 GW wave from only 7.5 KW input. That must have sounded especially unbelievable to people who were not yet even aware that the solar wind exists. Disbelief in that incredible claim might have contributed to the rumor that he had lost his mind. If it is possible to harness solar wind like Tesla said, we aren't aware of how to do it yet. But no one seems to have investigated Plauson's research lately or this aspect of Tesla's research. Plauson claimed to harness tens to hundreds of KW using only tethered metal balloons. In his patent Plauson said the energy came from the atmosphere, which might be possible, but it seems more likely it would have been harnessing solar wind energy as it enters the atmosphere if only because extracting energy from the atmosphere like that seems more impossible.

First time I've ever had a real answer when asking anyone. A lot of people I have asked believe that the government and/ or JP Morgan are the reason we don't use this energy. Because they can't make a profit off of it I guess. He wanted to make a low frequency, high power, isotropic antenna. Then shoot a low frequency, high power, continuous, radio wave from it. This wave would travel around the world. It would have so much power that any radio antenna could pick up enough energy to power appliances. How does tesla [the car company] use his inventions in their cars? Adding on: Wireless electricity already exists in the form of conductive wireless charging, which is most often seen in phones as inductive wireless charging. From the Wikipedia page: > the use of an induction coil which produces an electromagnetic field via a charging station where energy is transferred to an electronic device which is also equipped with a corresponding induction coil. It's essentially charging the device via electromagnetism. Standard charging methods rely on the conventional (and far more efficient) application of electricity: in a closed circuit, with electrons travelling in a loop from the negative terminal to the positive.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 86.24, 'recall': 4.09, 'fmeasure': 7.8}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 32.98, 'recall': 1.55, 'fmeasure': 2.97}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 50.79, 'recall': 2.41, 'fmeasure': 4.6}}"

How do DSLR cameras work?,"The image is formed by a mirror that reflects the light into the lens, and then to the viewfinder. The mirror is flipped out of the way when you take the photo, and the image is then captured by the camera. The mirror is a mirror, but it is not just any mirror. It is a special mirror that has been ground to have a certain curvature. The mirror is made of glass, and it is ground so that it is flat on the side that is closest to the lens, but it is curved on the side that is farthest from the lens. The curvature of the mirror is designed to reflect the light from the lens back to the lens, so that the light can then be focused onto the sensor. When the mirror is flipped out of the way, the light is not reflected back to the lens, but instead it is reflected onto a sensor. The sensor is a special piece of electronics that is designed to detect the light that is reflected onto it, and it converts the light into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is then sent to the camera's processor, where it is converted into a digital image. This is the image that you see on the camera's LCD screen, and it is also the image that is stored on the camera's memory card.","SLR as a term is pretty well defined - it stands for ""Single-Lens Reflex"". Forget digital for a moment - remember normal point and shoot film cameras? You'd have a small viewfinder at the top, which you'd look through. Well, the problem with those is that you're not quite seeing the same as the camera lens sees - a bit like looking through a gun sight. They'll be close, and at a certain distance it'll be the same, but you're ultimately looking through a different window. In addition, this also means you can't easily use adjustable lenses because you'd simply have to guess the focus and zoom. Well, SLR's solved that problem by having a mirror which moves. When you're not taking a photo the mirror is positioned so that the viewfinder is looking directly through the lens. In addition to being able to accurately compose the photo, this also means you can use adjustable lenses because you can physically see whether it's in focus or not. When you press the button, the mirror moves and exposes the film to exactly the same light you've been looking at. DSLR is simply the digital equivalent. The mirror is still there, but instead of film you have a digital sensor. You press the shutter, the mirror moves, and the sensor can now ""see"" through the lens. In day to day life, however, DSLR is somewhat synonymous with the idea of a higher quality camera. They generally come with additional features, better resolutions, better software and so on. But, strictly speaking, to be a DSLR they simply need that mirror system. Slow mo guys did a good video on the internal mechanism URL_0 DSLR are the digital equivalent of SLR. Instead of a film sensor it uses a digital sensor ( a lot larger than other point and shoot camera). SLR or Single-Lens Reflex are a type of camera that use a shutter and a mirror. the shutter is highly configurable in its speed and opening time. the mirror is there to divert the image from the film/sensor to the view-sight. The shutter enable to configure the amount of light going to the sensor to produce the picture. Basically, when you press the button on a DSLR , 3 things are happening. First , the mirror gets out of the way. secondly, the shutter is opening.

Why is it so hard to completely prevent clipping of 3D models in video games?,"Clipping is a problem in 3D graphics that occurs when a 3D model is behind a wall or other object that blocks its view. It's a problem that has been around since the early days of 3D graphics and is still an issue today. There are a few different types of clipping. One is when a model is behind a wall, which is easy to fix. Another is when a model is too close to a wall. Another is when a model is too close to another object. The problem is that the 3D graphics engine has to be able to determine what objects are in front of, behind, and next to each other. This is difficult to do with a 3D model, as it is difficult to determine where the model ends and where the wall or other object starts. There are several ways to fix this problem. One is to use a technique called ""ray tracing,"" which involves shooting rays of light from the camera and seeing where they hit. This allows the engine to determine where objects are and where the camera is. Another is to use ""physics"" to determine where objects are. This works by calculating where the object would be in space based on physics.   if the object is a rigid body, but is difficult for more complex objects. Another is to use a technique called ""skeletal animation,"" which uses a skeleton to determine where objects are.  ","It comes down to hitboxes. These are imaginary cubes drawn around ""things"" in games. The more detailed the hitboxes are, the more computations need to be done to determine if things collide. Lets say you have a minecraft dude. His hitboxes are simple because he's already a few cubes. Its easy to do the math to determine when one cube hits or intersects or runs into another cube. Or if I shoot your minecraft dude with a gun, all I have to do is aim within the imaginary hotbox cubes that surround your dude. Pretty simple. But as the 3d models of things (your Halo dude, that explody barrel, the monster) get more complex, the less ideal a few cube hitbox is going to be. no, you want the hitbox for your character to match the geometry of your character. If your Halo dude had a simple single hitbox cube, if you got a rocket anywhere in that imaginary cube it would count as a hit. But thats bullcrap because you totally jumped that rocket, it went _between_ your dude's legs. So now, to be more accurate the hitbox model that represents where your dude ""is"" has to be made up of a bunch of smaller geometric shapes. Maybe, the hitbox model of your dude is almost as complex as the visualization model of your dude. But as you add complexity to that model, all the math to calculate whether bullets, rockets, explody things collided or hit your dude, get a lot more complex. And complexity is fine, but there's only so much processing power available, given your game client and the server have to calculate not only whether your dude got hit by that grenade blast, but the other 63 dudes on the server. Its a similar thing to the calculations on how your dude is affected by the geometry of other things. Your guy is leaning up against a wall? If the collision/hitbox model of your guy was really detailed, and the geometry of your dude's model was programmed to do it, you could model individual limbs (nay, in some games with ragdoll physics, individual bones) and how they interact with a wall, a crate, riding that horse... but again, complexity and ""realism"" brings computations. So the guys who write game engines have to strike a balance between ""well maybe the wizard's flowing robes sometimes clip into the wall he's standing next to, but at least a 64 person battle has a decent frame rate"" vs. ""we have simulated character models down to individual chest hairs. But you can only get 2 frames per second."" Vfx student here. From what I know, In order to do that would essentially require creating everything as physics objects or create individual hit boxes for each element in the game. Not easy and can really place a burden on your computer. I am sure there is someone more experienced in this topic, but depending on how detailed the models or elements in the game are, it's just easier to allow clipping in a few of the elements rather than miss a release date or spend money trying to correct the problem.

Whats the difference between torque and horsepower?,"- It's an old question. I'll give it a shot. Horsepower is a measure of how much work can be done by an engine. It's a measure of how much torque it produces. Torque is a measure of how much force is being applied to an engine. It's a measure of how much power the engine is producing. So, a car with a lot of horsepower is able to produce a lot of torque. But, a car with a lot of torque can't produce as much horsepower. The reason is that horsepower is a measure of how much work can be done with a car, and the work is proportional to the torque. If a car has a lot of torque, it can do more work, and therefore it has more horsepower. Horsepower is a measure of the engine's power. Torque is a measure of the engine's twisting power. Torque is the rotational force that makes a car move, and horsepower is the power that makes the car move. Horsepower is the rate at which work is done, and torque is the amount of work being done. In a car, horsepower is the measure of how fast the engine can turn the wheels. Torque is the measure of how much force is being applied to the wheels.  ","Torque is the real, measurable force applied by the wheels to the road. (It's generated by the engine, then multiplied by the gearbox, final drive, and wheels.) Because it's applied by a circular wheel, it's measured in a combined unit of weight and length - pound-feet or newton-meters. A torque of one newton-meter applied to the road is equivalent to the force exerted on the wheel's hub by a weight of one newton, suspended horizontally from a stick that's one meter long and attached to the hub at the other end. Horsepower is not a real measurable force - it is a mathematical construct that represents the engine's ability to accomplish work over time. The work is moving a certain weight (the car) across a certain distance over a certain time. You'll notice that compared to torque, time is now added. So if the weight of the car is the same, and the distance it's traveling is the same (let's say, a quarter mile), then to do the work over a shorter period of time - get there faster - you need to use up more horsepower. Because there is a direct mechanical relationship between the engine's revs and the wheel revs, and therefore the car's actual speed, horsepower is calculated as torque multiplied by revs, and divided by a specific coefficient to account for the difference in units. Note: this is about engine torque, measured at the crankshaft. The torque at the wheels is a much larger figure, multiplied by the gearbox, final drive, and wheel circumference. (A horsepower is around 745 watts, because James Watt calculated this as the power of a typical mining horse and used it for marketing, to show how many horses his engine could replace. In the standard system, one watt is the amount of work/energy that raises a weight of one newton to a height of one meter in one second.) The super basic, non-mathematical answer: Torque is how much work you can do. Horsepower is how fast you can do that work. Think of a semi tractor-trailer next to a souped up Honda. Both engines could make the same number of horsepower, but the semi tractors engine makes a LOT more torque. The semi tractor can do a lot more work, but it takes longer to do it.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 65.47, 'recall': 36.59, 'fmeasure': 46.95}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 21.62, 'recall': 12.06, 'fmeasure': 15.48}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.94, 'recall': 17.29, 'fmeasure': 22.19}}"

"How is it that we put salt in ice cream machines to make the ice colder, but we also put salt on our sidewalks and streets to melt the ice?"," Cooling and melting are two different processes. Cooling is when you lower the temperature of something, while melting is when a substance transitions from a solid to a liquid. Salt lowers the freezing temperature of water, which is why we put it in ice cream machines. This is the same principle used in ice makers. Salt lowers the freezing temperature of ice, which is why we put it on sidewalks and streets. This is why we put salt on roads in the winter. Salt lowers the freezing temperature of water, which is why we put it on sidewalks and streets. This is why we put salt on roads in the winter.","Because you're not making the ice colder in the ice cream machine. In both cases your goal is to make liquid water colder, but the reasons for wanting colder liquid water are different. In the case of the ice cream maker, there's always at least a thin layer of liquid between the cream container and the solid ice, so colder liquid water means more heat transfers out of the ice cream and into the liquid water (so the ice cream freezes fast enough to freeze the air bubbles into the mix which is why ice cream has such great texture). In the case of the sidewalks, colder liquid water means more ice melts and flows off the sidewalk and melting continues at lower temperatures, reducing the slipping hazard. TL;DR - Salt doesn't make ice colder. What you're going for in both cases is a state change - you want liquid water, not solid water (ice) - without having to compromise the temperature. Unless you have some continuous source of coolant (like my buddies at work that used to make iced cream with Liquid Nitrogen, lol) the ice you have is all the coolant you'll get, so you'll want to freeze the iced cream quickly before the elements warm the coolant (ice/water) beyond usefulness. In order to best transfer the heat away from the ingredients into the ice, you want the *highest possible surface area* of the spinning aluminum container to contact the coolant. Ice cubes aren't that great, crushed ice or party ice is better (smaller chunks), but ultimately liquid is best. You could use glycol or something, but the most available and safest liquid is water. If you want to get water cold enough to freeze the iced cream without freezing into a solid block itself, you have to add salt to lower the freezing point. Fun fact, ice rinks use a salt water (brine) which run through pipes in the concrete beneath the ice surface in order to maintain the temperature at around 19 degrees Fahrenheit. Salt does the same think to ice on sidewalks, except the motivation there is that you just don't want solid water (ice) around. Liquid water will flow away and reduce the hazard/obstacle. These are both the same reason! It's a really good question. Salt makes the freezing point of water lower. That means when you throw it on ice, it tends to melt the ice. Even in the Ice Cream machine. What happens is the solid = > liquid process (melting) requires a small amount of energy (the heat of fusion) even if the temperature stays the same. In the sidewalk case, the large heat capacity of the sidewalk, driveway, Earth under the ice, ... gives up this heat without changing temperature. In the Ice Cream machine case, the ice is insulated from a large source of heat (by the ice cream machine's bucket). This means there is no good source of heat and the heat of fusion much come from the ice and the ice cream inside the can. The ice melts faster, even though it is driving the temperature down from the melting poinf of plain ice to the melting point of ice in salt water. Salt lowers the freezing point of water. In the case of the streets, it means that the water will remain liquid at lower temperatures. In the case of the ice cream, it makes the ice slurry colder without freezing solid. Salt lowers the melting point of water. As a result of this, some of it melts. Something people don't often consider about the act of melting ice is that it takes energy. To change ice at 0C into water at 0C, you need to add about 333Kj/Kg of water, which is quite a bit. This energy has to come from somewhere, and since everywhere is cold, somewhere has to get colder. This means both the water that's formed and the remaining ice cool off to make up for the difference in energy, and because converting a kilo of ice to water takes about the same amount of energy as heating that water from 0C to 80C, the temperature drop is quite steep for a given amount of water formed. This is also why the salted ice cube challenge is stupid. You're pressing ~-20C water up against your skin, frostbite is fast at that temperature with that much thermal conductivity. There is a lot of bad info here. Liquid/solid is irrelevant, but what is relevant is that phase change from solid to liquid is endothermic, meaning it requires energy to occur. When you salt the ice, the phase change from ice to water robs the cream of its energy, making it colder and, hopefully, triggering a phase change in the unsalted water in the ice cream mix, from liquid to solid. So as the salt melts the ice, the transfer of energy causes the custard to freeze. If you had an outer bowl and an inner bowl, put ice into the inner bowl and poured molten metal into the outer bowl, you would expect the water to boil as energy goes from the cooling metal and into the ice. As the metal hardens, the ice melts and may evaporate. This is easy to grasp and is the exact same concept but instead of a phase change that is exothermic (molten metal loses energy as it cools and hardens) you have a phase change that is endothermic (salt melting ice from solid to liquid). The process simply works in reverse. Does that make sense? There are a few factors to it, but some of them are material, temperature difference, and surface area. Thermal energy is always trying to balance out. If something has been in a room for a long time, it is going to be about the same temperature as the air and surface it is sitting on. Metal, however, feels colder than wood, even if both the metal and wood are the same temperature. This is because different materials transfer thermal energy at different rates and THAT is what you feel when you touch things, not the actual temperature. Metal is more conductive of heat, so you lose more heat from your hand to metal than from hand to wood. Water it's self isn't too great, which is why it take so long for it to boil, but the one thing it has over ice is surface area. The larger the surface area of a material, the more of that material is able to directly transfer energy from a heat source into it's self, so while ice may be colder, water can conform to the surface of whatever it is in contact to, due to it being a fluid, and is able to take heat from the soon to be ice cream faster than ice, despite ice having a larger difference in temperature than water compared to the ice cream. Ideally, you would want a liquid as cold as ice so that it can conform to the surface of the ice cream AND transfer the heat better, because the third factor here, temperature difference, matters quite a bit too. With a larger difference in temperature between two materials, you get a larger transfer of energy between them. salty water is nifty because salty water remains liquid when it is colder than pure water, so it fits this niche pretty easily. It is plentiful, not harmful to the environment, and cheap, so there is little to no trouble in using it to cool your ice cream down. For sidewalks, you want to help the ice melt, and since salty water becomes liquid at lower temperatures, the salty water on the surface helps make the ice under it turn to salty water and thus melt. ___ TL;DR: water can hold tons of heat, but sucks at transferring heat, but colder water sucks less at transfer. Ice sucks more because it has pockets of air, both at the interface, and within it, and that sucks at holding heat. Salty water allows water to not be ice at colder temperatures, which means it is even colder than cold water, and has no pesky air in the way. This reminded me of a time a few years back, I asked my 13 yo son to go salt the sidewalk. Walked out to see what was taking him so long...uhm...he was using the kitchen salt shaker. I about peed my pants laughing so hard. Even funnier because he's a smart kid. Was a scholar athlete and is now a Corpsman. I still tease him about it. The goal of adding salt to ice in both cases is the same, to melt freshwater ice. The melting point of saltwater is lower than freshwater. By adding salt the ice melts. On the sidewalk, the slippery is gone. In the ice cream maker, the bucket is insulated so the heat energy required to melt the ice must come from the ice cream container which freezes the cream. The rotating container has a stationary dasher in it that keeps the cream from getting frozen solid on the sides and leaving liquid in the middle. The salt melts the ice in the outer layer of the ice cream machine. This sucks heat out of the inner layer, letting your ice cream freeze faster. Speaking from personal experience, you do NOT want the salt in the actual ice cream As long as the ice isn't too cold, salt does 2 things to ice at the same time: 1. Solid turns to liquid (ice melts). 2. The water absorbs heat from its surroundings as it melts. On the sidewalk or road, the ice melts, or at least the hard ice gets softer and can be physically removed. If it melts completely, the resulting water flows to lower ground, or is carried off on a tire or a shoe, or it eventually evaporates in the dry winter air, or it re-freezes if the weather gets cold enough. In the ice cream maker, the ice melts, pulling heat from whatever it is touching (the metal can with ice cream mix inside it). The resulting salt-water flows out the hole in the side of the ice cream maker and kills your grass. But it is replaced with more ice (which is as cold as the freezer).

How does oil lubricate an engine without combusting or contaminating the fuel?,"Oil lubricates by flowing through tiny channels between moving parts. It's a low viscosity fluid, so it's able to flow through these channels and between moving parts. It's also very thin, so it's able to flow through tiny channels between moving parts. It's also very thin, so it's able to flow through tiny channels between moving parts. This allows the moving parts to move smoothly and easily, which reduces friction. This reduces the amount of heat generated by friction, which reduces the amount of fuel needed to run the engine. Oil also helps to remove dirt and grime from the engine. It's able to flow through the engine and pick up dirt and grime. This dirt and grime is then trapped in the oil, which helps to keep the engine clean.","The fuel is sprayed into the cylinders, where it mixes with air, is compressed, combusted and then evacuated out. Engine oil is not put directly into the cylinders. It gets pumped and directed to just about all of the other internal components though. What separates the inside of the cylinder from the rest of the inside of the engine, is a set of piston rings. And actually, a tiny bit of the engine oil gets in between the piston rings and the walls of the cylinders and lubricates that movement. As I understand it, a tiny bit of the oil does get caught up with the combustion of the fuel. An engine has an oil consumption rate. So even if you don't have any leaks, you eventually do have to add oil. It's usually pretty low and most people simply get to an oil change interval before actually having to add oil. But some (likely older) engines can go though oil much faster and will need to be topped up regularly. The oil and fuel are in two different areas and sealed off from each other by gaskets. And it doesn't ignite because it's ignition point is far higher than any temperature the engine achieves during normal operation. Not the answer, but incidentally two stroke engines actually use fuel mixes with oil. URL_0 Piston rings act as a seal. They are precision machined to a thousandth of an inch. The rings actually dip into the oil sump to lubricate. Older engines ""burn oil"" due to wear on the rings.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 38.41, 'recall': 20.08, 'fmeasure': 26.37}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.84, 'recall': 3.04, 'fmeasure': 4.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.29, 'recall': 10.61, 'fmeasure': 13.93}}"
Software Testing - Test Cases," The software tester may use different methods to create test cases. In this response, we will discuss the most common method of test case creation. Test Cases are a set of test procedures that are used to validate the functionality of a software application. They are the foundation of software testing.   by testers to ensure that the application works as expected.

How are some car radios capable of spelling out song titles and artist names when tuning into some FM stations?,"There is a field of data in the broadcast signal called the [Program Service Information (PSI) field]( URL_0 ) that contains data about the radio station and its programming. This includes information like the station's call letters, name, frequency, and the song title and artist currently playing. The radio station sends this data out in the PSI field, and the radio's tuner decodes it and sends it to the radio's microprocessor. The microprocessor then displays the song title and artist on the radio's display.","Radio stations do a lot of clever work to fit more information in the audio stream then just the audio. Originally an FM station were just a simple mono audio signal. However they found out that the signal quality were good enough to deliver audio signals at much higher frequency then the humans can hear. So they composed the difference between the left and right audio channels and turned the pitch up higher then humans can hear and sent it out on the FM band. A stereo FM receiver were then able to split the audio signal based on pitch and turn the pitch down to its original pitch to then make stereo sound. Later on someone figured out that there were still a lot of unused signals above human hearing so they added a digital signal to a high pitch frequency so it can display the name of the radio station, what song is played and even codes for traffic information where it is supported. So the name of the song title is just part of a high pitch audio signals on the FM signal.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 48.86, 'recall': 23.12, 'fmeasure': 31.39}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.9, 'recall': 3.24, 'fmeasure': 4.41}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.41, 'recall': 13.44, 'fmeasure': 18.25}}"
Why is it so hard to reverse-engineer something? Shouldn't it be simple to just copy the parts exactly?,It's not just the parts. It's the way they're put together.   the components interact with each other.   the components are made and how they're assembled.   the components are tested and how they're calibrated.   the components are packaged and shipped.   the components are sold.   the components are used.   the components are maintained.   the components are repaired.   the components are updated.   the components are replaced.   the components are disposed of.   the components are recycled.   the components are reused.   the components are re-purposed.   the components are re-sold.   the components are re-used.   the components are re-purposed.   the components are re-sold.   the components are re-used.   the components are re-purposed.   the components are re-sold.   the components are re-used.   the components are re-purposed.   the components are re-sold.   the components are re-used.   the components are re-purposed.   the components are re-sold.   the components are re-used.   the components are re-purposed.  ,"No. Let's say you try and reverse engineer an iPhone. You need to know what each component is made of, this is NOT easy at all and requires some fairly high level analytical skills. You also need to know how each component talks to each other. An iPhone isn't just the solid stuff, and then OS installed; there is firmware that controls how say the capacitance from the screen is delivered to other bits of circuitry. There is software that controls the battery. Another example would be say a grain mill! You could build something that looks the same easily; a stone with an axel and then another stone on a pivot that can roll along in a circle. But if you don't know how to use it (the software) it's useless. With modern stuff the material becomes a big factor!! Touch screens are made of very special materials for one. Military hardware? Can also be very exotic composites, it's not just steel etc. Everyone is using House as an example, but what about a cake? You can analyze a cake and determine it's made of starch and sugars, but could you really reverse-engineer that to come up with a list of raw ingredients AND a recipe to recreate the cake? Even if I gave you the exact list of ingredients, but no directions for mixing them (quantity and order) or baking it, what good would that do you? Manufacturing engineer, here. It depends a lot on the complexity of the object and if there are critical parameters or tolerances. Reverse-engineering a simple table with square legs is easy. Now think of a nice table with a pattern lathe-turned into the legs and a stain. It may be difficult to determine the wood under the stain and the stain color. It will also take much longer to figure out the lathe tooling setup to replicate the legs. If the replica isn't exact, it could still be a nice table. When you consider mechanical and electronic items, the process is more difficult for a number of reasons. Electronic components are exponentially more complicated. If you can identify all the pieces, you still have to arrange them precisely. Imagine trying to copy a complete road map of Texas with a pencil and protractor - no tracing. If you manage to build the thing correctly, you still need to develop firmware and software so that it runs as closely as possible to what you are trying to reverse-engineer. a real life example is that you can take a look at a house. it has some walls, roof, windows. pretty simple easy to understand concepts. now you are in charge of building your own house, and you know what a house is made up of. now, how do you make a rebar? what is rebar made out of? steel? great! how do we create steel? it's easy to copy simple things with simple materials, but it's extremely difficult to copy advanced things manufactured with complicated manufacturing processes. yes. but you dont know the properties of all the parts involved. Or the reason they have that property. For example when the soviets tried to copy the american b29 bomber from b29's that had to land in russia, because they didn't know the purpose of all the parts, they [went as far as integrating the bullet holes]( URL_0 ), the planes had suffered into their copys. Without extensive testing, that sometimes includes the destruction of parts, you realy cant get all the material properties right. Add to that, that sometimes you just dont have the technology to replicate the original and reverse engineering can become very dificult. Everyone here is talking about the manufacture of something, and they are explaining why copying things isn't easy...but that isn't reverse engineering. That's just trying to duplicate something. Copying stuff is easy. If you look at a piece of electronic equipment, a good chunk of the chips and processors are off the shelf. You can go and buy them and slap them all together and there you go. But that isn't reverse engineering, that's just assembling something. If company x builds a cool thing, and company y can't figure out how they did it on their own, company y then needs to buy the thing from company x and do a complete analysis of it. Reverse engineering isn't about copying something. So company y brings in the engineers to look at every single component and wire, and then write up the full specs based on what they see in the hardware. Going back to everyone's house analogy, it's basically looking at a house and then drawing up blueprints. It's not nearly as complicated as figuring out how to manufacture steel, but it isn't easy. It's time consuming and tedious. This is what reverse engineering is. Looking at a product, and then figuring out exact specifications for it. After you get your full list of specifications, you hand that off to another completely clean and brand new team to actually design something based on those specifications created from the original product from company x. Now company y has a product similar to company x, but they have plausible deniability that they copied anything. Say you have 20. Did you make it by adding 5+5+5+5, or multiplying 4 x 5, or subtracting 10 from 30? Just having a part's measurements does not give you the information about the manufacturing techniques involved, which have a huge effect on the part's performance. Furthermore, operating the resultant product requires a decent understanding of how it works. Blind replication won't just get you nowhere, it's not as simple as you'd like to think. Ask me to make a lightbulb from scratch? I know enough of how to smelt and refine ores, blow glass, etc. that I could do it in under 3 months if you dropped me in the middle of the woods with the food/shelter to keep me and my project safe. Hell, with half a year I could make a power source to light it up as well, might need all of one community college course or two days in a library beforehand to fill in a few blanks. I'd almost consider doing it for a few grand at the end before remembering I could make more at minimum wage in that timeframe. Now, hand me a bulb, any bulb, and tell me to make that exact one? Hah. Fuck that. And you wanna know why? Specifics, my dear! I could be on Franklin's heels in a quarter of a year because I spend too much time on Wikipedia and lack a legitimately worthwhile outlet for my curiosity, and I'm reading about something that can be done successfully with fairly modest margins of error before it fails to work. I can almost ballpark a working plan to make everything I need from the stone hatchet and hammer to the turbine wheel powered by a creekbed or steam (or hell, hamster wheel using improvised woodland critters!) on the fly. Such is the power of decades of complacent fact-collecting paired with an overactive imagination that likes to ground itself firmly in ""bullshit that just might fucking work!"" But tell me to make that lightbulb. Any one fucking lightbulb. And let me do it in the city, with a project budget of a few grand? I will firmly tell you to go fuck yourself in your round hole with a square peg, and that's only because I don't know a wittier way to tell you to do it with the star-shaped peg. Because I can't be fucked to figure out what filament your bulb uses, if it's filled with x gas, normal air, a vacuum, etc. I don't wanna fuck with making the screw-in base. I don't wanna spend the time being a good enough glass blower to make the bulb the perfect shape, let alone figure out what kinda sand and additional minerals and whateverthefuck goes into it. And I don't want to fucking stamp the goddamn ink on the bulb, or lettering into the base. TL;DR Franken-fucking together a functional science experiment is easy because your target outcome has Texas-sized borders. Counterfeiting has pinhole-sized borders, so it's harder even if you're just making saltwater taffy. It's easy to mix yellow and blue to get green. It's hard to get blue and yellow FROM green. It is actually really really hard and expensive. Part of what makes companies rich are knowing how to making things cheaply. Anyone can make an iPhone. The trick is making it for $500 instead of $5 million. So even if you managed to figure out all the parts, you still don't know Apple's secrets of making an iPhone. Say you've got a cup of coffee. We know that was made from coffee beans and hot water, but how would you find that out if you didn't know? You can't get coffee beans back out of coffee. You can analyze the coffee with some expensive equipment and find out what chemicals are in it, but you can't find out where they came from. Now let's consider an electronic device. It probably has some IC chips in it. You can't just take them apart and figure out how they work. It would be extremely expensive to analyze them on a microscopic level and figure out how to make an identical chip. All you can realistically do is measure the inputs and outputs and try to figure out how they're related. So, you're limited by what you can actually observe and measure. It's often impossible or impractical to determine exactly how something was manufactured. Parts are not always simple discrete pieces that can be measured on their own. Lets think about a metal part you need to rebuild because its broken but you have no exact design for it. Now you go for an 3D scanner, scan the bad boy and create a mold for your new component. Then you pour in the metal and give it time to cool down. You wrap the component out of his mold, but it will be smaller than the part which broke down. That because metal shrink when it cools down. To merge out this problem, quite much engineering work has to be done and even then the piece wouldnt be like the broken one. To carry the house analogy further, how do you know what gauge (thickness) wire to use for the electrical outlets, or how the plumbing is laid out. These things are buried inside the walls and invisible to you unless you start knocking down walls. There are many things like this in a house that you cannot see, and thus cannot replicate precisely. And it may not just be items you cannot see, but how they were made. When looking at a product you are only seeing the final result; how it ended up that way may not be obvious. Take christmas tree tinsel for example. Seeing the final result in the box tells you very little about how they are able to package it so cleanly. And it is actually very difficult to do; companies try hard to keep the exact method a secret. In both cases what we are really talking about is information. Some of the information needed to copy an object may be hidden or may not exist in the object at all. The big trick with reverse-engineering is being able to infer what you cannot see from what you can see. A more modern example: Some programmable computer chips come with fuses that can be blown after being programmed. This prevents any changes and prevents anyone from reading the program back out. One way reverse-engineering folks get around this is with a special machine that can shave off epoxy covering of a chip and expose the raw circuits inside the chip. Then they proceed to poke the chip with several very sharp sticks (probes) to learn how it was programmed.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.72, 'recall': 3.47, 'fmeasure': 6.45}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.12, 'recall': 0.63, 'fmeasure': 1.16}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.16, 'recall': 2.65, 'fmeasure': 4.92}}"
"on my Honda, there's an ""eco"" button that's supposed to help me save gas. Why wouldn't they just make that a permanent feature on the car instead of a button?","Because people are lazy and if you don't have to press a button to do something, people will just forget. And if people forget, they will complain and demand that it be changed. So the eco button is there to make people feel like they are doing something, even if they don't actually do it. I've never heard of a car having an eco button, but I do know that some cars have a ""sport"" button that makes the car more powerful and less efficient. There are a few reasons. One is that it's a way to make the car feel more responsive to the driver. The eco button will change the way the car responds to the gas pedal and the steering wheel. It's a way to make the car feel more like a sports car. Another reason is that it's a way to make the car more fuel efficient. The eco button will make the car use less fuel and burn less fuel. This is because the car will adjust the way it uses the fuel in the engine. It will use less fuel because it will adjust the air/fuel mixture in the engine. The engine will burn less fuel because it will adjust the timing of the fuel injection. The eco button will also make the car use less fuel because it will adjust the speed of the engine. The engine will be slower and burn less fuel.  ","Because Eco-mode gives up a lot of power and throttle response in exchange for (slightly) better fuel economy. I have a Honda Pilot, and Eco-mode is very frustrating and even somewhat dangerous in many situations such as merging, going up hills, or passing. You punch the accelerator and... not much happens. I would not want this as the default setting on that car. I only ever use Eco-mode when cruising down long stretches of highway. Sometimes people want more acceleration. Eco mode makes you accelerate slower and the engine outputs less power. ""Econ"" reduces acceleration as well as A/C strength (to a small degree). There is also Sport mode in the models like the Civic (I have the 2016 Touring model), which increases throttle response and makes acceleration quicker, as well as simulates a higher gear (engine braking). Everything has a cost. You don't just use less gas because you pushed a button and get the same performance as before. If you want more power, you need to give up speed, if you want speed, you sacrifice power. Eco mode usually turns off some cylinders from being used turning a V8 or V6 into a V4 engine. If you are burning less fuel, you are getting less power. More than enough to drive but acceleration will be slower and even top speed, though still beyond the speed limit.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 33.87, 'recall': 36.05, 'fmeasure': 34.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.67, 'recall': 6.03, 'fmeasure': 5.85}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.92, 'recall': 15.88, 'fmeasure': 15.38}}"

Utilities in the work area need to be located by hand excavation (that's the law) 2. Utility relocation, protection, and support can be tedious and time consuming. Gas, steam, and electric are dangerous to relocate, therefore every precaution is taken. Telecom relocation is time consuming due to copper and fiber splicing. Water may only be able to be taken out of service at certain times. Sewer is typically fairly deep and time consuming to shore up trenches. 3. Materials cannot often be brought in and stock piled due to space restrictions. Depending on where you're working, they might not allow you to store any materials on site. This means everything has to be brought in when it's needed, even the excavation equipment might need to be removed and delivered daily. 4. Truck loads of material brought in (fill, concrete, pipe) have to be ordered and picked up or scheduled for delivery. Example: you order a concrete truck and it sits in a traffic jam, it gets there late. If it's been spinning in the drum too long, it's no longer any good and the load is rejected. Now you wait for another load to come. 5. Work permits typically stipulate the times you can work. I've gotten permits where we could only work 10am - 2pm, Monday - Thursday or 8am - 6pm Weekends only. Subtract at least an hour of productivity from that for opening up the job site and cleaning up. 6. Unforeseen circumstances cause a lot of delay (inadequate design on the engineer's part, poor planning on the contractor's part, utilities not known about until the tooth of a machine bucket ripped through it.) This is not to say that some of this doesn't happen in building construction, it does, but their job sites are usually less constrained than road work. Source: Civil Engineer, worked construction in NYC for 10 years. Just for starters: There's a ton of ancient and delicate infrastructure under any urban street and there aren't great records of what-all is down there (and you can't see it until you've put a backhoe through it.) Some of that stuff is natural gas lines -measure thrice, cut once. If you built your medium-sized building underground you would be comparing apples to apples. There's also the matter of money and resources. Most streets and roads are publicly funded whereas most buildings are private, with additional dollars associated to completing it on time and on budget. There's more money to be made in the commercial sector and a larger pool of subcontractors to choose from, unlike in municipal projects where you can only choose workers that have already been certified to work for the state/county. It's also a different skill-set. My brother who was a roofer for hotels could switch to residential without much trouble. But the electricians/ plumbers who work on municipal projects usually have much more training. Many times if you see the same orange cones up for a long period of time its because they're waiting on someone specialized enough to do the work or certify the work was done correctly. Source: friends and family who work private sector construction. Please correct any misstatements on the public side. /u/Dennaldo has the most comprehensive answer, but didn't touch on crew scheduling -- maybe it wasn't an issue in NYC! You or your prime contractor may or may not have all the various crews that a project needs, available at the drop of a hat -- many construction projects are scheduled a year in advance. The sewer-pipe crew, for example, might be multitasking several road projects at once, since each of them doesn't need a full-time sewer crew. But, they may be working on project 17 on the other side of town for a couple more days when your project is ready for them again. So, everybody shifts to something else for a while. The worst thing to have happen is to have a crew show up on their scheduled-weeks-in-advance day, and **you're not ready** -- your project has been delayed by weather, or a previous task isn't quite ready yet. So, to keep that crew busy, they get sent (out of order, so to speak) to a different project, and YOU WAIT. To accomodate this, your project scheduler may allocate a week for three days worth of work now and then, so that a previous crew can lose a day without impacting the rest of the project. That's another reason why it may look like nothing is happening -- scheduled slack that turned out not to be needed.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 45.4, 'recall': 9.37, 'fmeasure': 15.53}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.47, 'recall': 0.51, 'fmeasure': 0.84}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.06, 'recall': 6.2, 'fmeasure': 10.28}}"

The entire concept of free energy is not pursued by power companies because it's simply not possible. The preservation of energy, along with the laws of thermodynamics, are not something that is easily challenged, simply because they are supported by a lot of hard evidence.

Why do cars have an air setting for legs/defrost but not face/defrost?,"It's because of the way the engine works. The engine is essentially a big box with lots of moving parts that need to be kept cool. The engine also needs lots of air to keep it running, and this air needs to be cooled as well. So the engineers designed the engine to blow cold air through the engine and cool it. This is why you have the air conditioning setting on your car. But the engineers also realized that the engineers also realized that you need to be able to see out the windshield to drive safely. So they put in the defrost setting to blow hot air over the windshield to melt any ice that might be on it. This hot air is generated by the heating element in the engine. It is not generated by the air conditioning system. So the engineers designed the air conditioning system to blow air through the engine to cool it, and they designed the defrost setting to blow hot air over the windshield. But they did not design the defrost setting to blow hot air over your face. They did not design the defrost setting to blow hot air over your face because your face is not a part of the engine.   because your face is not a part of the engine.   because your face is not a part of the engine.  ","Heat and defrost in a car are often related but different. In my car, there is one control for the vents that happens to also turn on the AC for the defrost settings. The defrost settings are either windshield or windshield plus feet. The purpose of turning on the AC is to dehumidify the air, removing fog from the windshield. In both cases, defrost implies hot air hitting the windshield. The windshield/foot setting is a compromise, as neither will be getting as much air as they would if it were exclusive. Because the air hitting the windshield quickly moves toward the vicinity of your head, it's good enough for the purpose of getting warm air to your face. You may need to turn up the fan speed to feel it. If you don't need to defog the windshield, you can of course just turn on the front vents. It's not necessary to have the AC going in this case, though in some conditions, you may want to and can turn the AC on manually. I vaguely recall some cars from decades ago that assumed the occupants couldn't handle separate settings for temperature and position, so always turned on the heat for foot and defrost and never turned it on for face.

One Way Mirrors,"are a device that allows light to pass through in one direction but not the other. In the case of a mirror, light passes through the mirror in the same direction as the light entering the mirror, but it cannot pass through in the opposite direction. This is achieved through the use of a reflective surface that is not perfectly transparent. In the case of a mirror, the reflective surface is silvered glass, which is a type of glass that has been coated with a thin layer of silver. This coating causes light to reflect off the glass in the same direction that it enters the mirror, but it does not allow light to pass through the glass in the opposite direction. When light hits a surface at a certain angle, it is reflected off of the surface. When light hits a mirror, it reflects off of the mirror and is reflected back to the viewer. If the viewer is in front of the mirror, the light will be reflected back to the viewer. If the viewer is behind the mirror, the light will be reflected back to the viewer.   angle of incidence is the angle at which light hits the mirror. If the angle of incidence is greater than 45 degrees, the light will be reflected back to the viewer. If the angle of incidence is less than 45 degrees, the light will pass through the mirror. This is why the light will pass through the mirror if the viewer is behind it.  ","They are actually transparent two-way mirrors. However, because there is a lot of light on the one side and little to no light on the other - note how the detective behind the glass are always in a dark room? - there is a lot of reflection on the brightly-lit side and little to none on the other, so all one side sees is reflection of itself while the other can see through the mirror.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 12.2, 'recall': 41.33, 'fmeasure': 18.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.37, 'recall': 8.11, 'fmeasure': 3.67}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 10.24, 'recall': 34.67, 'fmeasure': 15.81}}"
"Why do you need a NASA lens to record candle lit scenes on film, yet the human eye is as small as a mobile phone camera and can see low lit scenes just fine?","> Why do you need a NASA lens to record candle lit scenes on film, yet the human eye is as small as a mobile phone camera and can see low lit scenes just fine? The human eye can see very low lit scenes, but it has a hard time focusing on it. The camera has a much easier time focusing on the same thing. The camera can also take more light and make it brighter, which is why you can see a candlelit scene on film, but not on a mobile phone camera.","Our brain is incredibly powerful and can 'compute' the dynamic range and the white balance of everything we see. Even the the most expensive sensors on the best cameras available today can't recreate the wide dynamic range our eyes do for us, at least not without combining multiple images. Example. When driving through a tunnel as you approach the end your eyes see fantastic detail in the tunnel around you, AND in the bright outside the tunnel in front of you. Now try taking a photo of that (passenger!!) and see that you either get detail in the tunnel and super overexposed outside, or detail outside and underexposed inside. One day cameras may reach this level but not for a long while. You're thinking of the f0.7 lenses made in the 1960s and used both by NASA and Stanley Kubrick. He wanted to shoot motion pictures (35mm colour film) by candle light and, at that time, film sensitivity required such a fast lens to produce the required quality. Today, both film and digital sensors would be able to do the same job with f1.0 or even f1.4 lenses, which are commonly available. Professional DSLR lenses have f1.4 as a very common prime (non-zoom) aperture and f1.2 is also available. Today, pros use these more for their very narrow depth of field more than for their bright images, i.e., they want everything except the subject to be very out of focus and blurry. You can find lenses with f numbers at and under 1.0 but they are expensive specialist items. For example, there's an [f0.85]( URL_0 ) for $2000 which is only half a stop slower than the f0.7 NASA special from the 1960s. Modern digital cameras will happily shoot stills and videos with standard zoom lenses in candle light. The problem is that the images will be incredibly noisy unless you use long exposures that are impossible for moving subjects or for videos. The quality would be unsuitable for movie or TV production work. The human eye is actually not too different. Yes, you can see by candle light, but your colour perception is missing or very muted and there is the equivalent of noise present. The human eye has a maximum aperture around f2.1, over three stops (eight times) slower (dimmer) than f0.7. A rod cell in your eye can resolve a *single* photon. This can also be done with technology, but it requires relatively huge photo-multiplier tubes which are found in scientific apparatus and not consumer or professional cameras. The signal from the rod cells needs to be about 5 photons to be strong enough to reach the brain and be registered though, but 5 photons is still FAR better than a cheap CCD can do (I include $100k+ professional cameras in ""cheap"". ""expensive"" is the types of detectors used in multi- hundred million dollar particle accelerators that are the size of a cathedral - they can also detect single photons) (This is also helped by the insane dynamic range a human eye can achieve as the brain scales the output of individual photo receptors as needed, where a modern camera scales the output of all photo receptors together) There's a lot of crap here that either doesn't answer you or is just plain wrong.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.91, 'recall': 9.22, 'fmeasure': 15.83}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 20.65, 'recall': 3.37, 'fmeasure': 5.8}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.33, 'recall': 5.5, 'fmeasure': 9.44}}"
"Why are semis that carry liquid cylindrical, and not rectangular?"," Slightly off topic but the same principle is used in fire hydrants. The shape of the nozzle on the hydrant is also designed to be a cylinder. This is because when you spray water out of the nozzle, the water is going to follow the path of least resistance, so the water will follow the shape of the nozzle and not the shape of the hydrant. The same principle applies to the cylindrical shape of the tanker. The water will flow out of the nozzle in a more consistent and predictable manner because of the shape of the tanker. The shape of the tanker also helps with stability. The cylindrical shape of the tanker is more stable because the center of gravity is lower and more centered. This makes it easier for the driver to maneuver the tanker and maintain control. The same applies to the hydrant. The shape of the hydrant is designed to be stable and easy to maneuver.","Curved structures are mechanically stronger at storing contents under pressure.

The weight transfer from thousands of gallons of liquid sloshing around, can easily overcome braking force and. An also causing roll overs on turns Think of it in this way: Most materials are a lot stronger when you pull them and not bend them. Just think of a piece of paper. It can handle a lot of force when you pull it, but it will have literally no resistance for bending it. With metal it is exactly the same, only that metal itself is a lot stronger. When you weld metal together as a tube, it is a clever design, so when you put pressure inside the tube, the tube will try to expand. But to expand, its circumference would have to get bigger. And this means that the force caused by the pressure was converted into ""pulling-force"" circular around the circumference. With a rectangular container this wouldn't work. On the edges, the pressure will try to bend up the edges and usually the container will fail/rip open. But just imagine the rectangular container to be of a very bendable material, like rubber. Now apply pressure inside. As the pressure increases, the rectangular container will deform and end up circular. Because this is the most officiant form.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 49.69, 'recall': 24.46, 'fmeasure': 32.79}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.25, 'recall': 3.07, 'fmeasure': 4.12}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.84, 'recall': 12.23, 'fmeasure': 16.39}}"
Why do boy bikes typically have a bar across the top whereas girl bikes do not?,"I have no idea. I've never really thought about it before. I think the assumption that a girl bike doesn't have a bar across the top is a bad one. I'm sure there are plenty of girl bikes that have a bar across the top. If you're asking about the type of bike with a bar across the top, it's called a ""cruiser"". A cruiser is a bike with a more relaxed riding position, often with a more upright handlebar. There are cruisers for both men and women, but they are more commonly associated with men. The design of the cruiser is often associated with a more masculine style. This is likely due to the fact that the bikes were originally designed for men, and they were marketed as such.","Women used to wear long dresses to used to have to have to ""step through"" the frame in order to preserve their modesty. Males on the other hand could just pop their leg over the top. The tradition has just been maintained on most commercial bikes. It's a carry-over from the days when girls and women only work dresses or skirts-and-blouse outfits. The bar on a ""men's"" bike would make riding one in a dress quite awkward. I thought this was a holdover from olden times, when girls' bikes had to accommodate for dresses. Because girls traditionally wear skirts and dresses which get pushed up by the bar on boys bikes. In Scotland boys bikes also have the low crossbar because of the tradition of wearing kilts. As for 2, it's because of physics. Both men and women's bikes have the bar, which is necessary to form a truss in the central bike structure which is far, far stronger than just a single pipe. The only difference is the women's bar connects much lower than the men's, which structurally makes it weaker. This is due to a combination of men being physically heavier and that stereotypically men do more mountain biking/crazy outdoor stunts which would require the stronger frame. Where or not that's really true, men's bikes are actually the better design from a strength standpoint, and the altered frame on women's bikes is a concession due to the whole skirt thing and it's stuck around for marketing purposes. Women used to wear dresses/skirts. They still do, but they used to too. The design of the front half of a bike is referred to as the ""front triangle"" (the portion of the frame from the forks to the seatpost). Triangles are the strongest shape in nature because forced is added/displaced equally on all three sides. The step-through frame, generally regarded as a ""woman's"" bike was to allow a woman to get onto the bike while wearing a dress/skirt (they are different things). The ability to use a bicycle was hugely liberating for women when first introduced. While the step-through allowed women (and those with hip issues) the ability to get on a bike, structurally the frame is not as strong as the triangle (where the top tube is much higher). There was the [Penny in Yo Pants initiative]( URL_0 ), demonstrating a trick using pocket change to allow women in skirts to ride bicycles. There isn't really anything in cycling that is ""gender specific"". Men and womens seats now have options that have no center channel. Beyond that, it's just a matter of frame size - cranks, gears, wheels, handlebars (incl. tape) is a lot of personal preference and bike fit. I used to rent bikes. Low step are still good now particularly for people with hip or leg issues. I had an elder man renting specifically request the low step option for this reason. Also good for people who might lose their balance swinging a leg around, and of course, riding in compromising clothing. WSD options (low step) typically have a shorter distance from person to handle bars. This smaller space was built intentionally with women and their shorter wing span in mind. Personally I like having the bar there, and I do happen to have a longer wing span, so I typically take the male option of bikes.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.74, 'recall': 14.11, 'fmeasure': 22.91}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.42, 'recall': 3.79, 'fmeasure': 6.16}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.89, 'recall': 6.71, 'fmeasure': 10.89}}"
What does the small hole near the top of sinks do?," Pumping water into the sink is easy, but getting it out is a bit harder. The hole near the top of your sink is called a ""drain"" and it's job is to help get the water out of the sink. The drain is usually a small hole in the bottom of the sink, but sometimes it's a hole in the side or top of the sink. The drain is connected to a long, narrow tube called a ""drain pipe"" which goes down into the ground. The drain pipe has a hole at the end of it, which is called the ""drain trap."" The drain trap is where the water in the sink goes when you turn the faucet off. The water goes down the drain pipe and into the drain trap. The drain trap is important because it keeps the water from coming back up into the sink. If the drain trap wasn't there, the water would come back up into the sink when you turned the faucet on. That's why it's important to clean the drain trap regularly. The drain trap also helps to keep the sink clean by trapping any food or other things that you drop into the sink. The drain is connected to a pipe that goes underground. The pipe is usually made of PVC and is 1.5 inches in diameter.  ","It is there as an overflow. So if you forgot the plug in and the water open, the water should drain through there instead of overflowing the sink and onto the floors. The hole connects directly to the down drain pipe. Additional to what is already said, it's there so you can have air flow into the pipe when you empty the sink.

If the animal is sick, it may not be able to produce the same colors as it normally would. Also, some animals have bright colors to help them blend in with their surroundings.

What are the benefits that zero-G environments provide to science or manufacturing?," The benefits of zero-G environments are two-fold. The first is that the lack of gravity allows for a more accurate simulation of microgravity. This is important for things like space missions, where astronauts need to be able to train for the effects of microgravity. The second is that the lack of gravity allows for the creation of a vacuum. This is important for things like semiconductor manufacturing, where the lack of air molecules can allow for the creation of more efficient transistors.","At the moment its mainly for science. Not much commercial activity in space yet, outside of communication and observation satellites. The main things that benefit from zero G are things to do with crystal formation, like alloys. Say you have a big pot of molten metal alloy. As it solidifies, some alloys form tiny crystals called dendrites. The way these dendrites overlap and intertwine determines the properties of the resulting alloy. In gravity dendrites are subjected to all kinds of convection currents, density fluctuations etc. As such, they grow in very irregular shapes and break before they grow too large. Therefore it is very hard to make an alloy that lives up to its theoretical properties. In space all these flows and currents are drastically reduced, or eliminated entirely. As such you get a much better alloy. Same thing for many other things relating to crystal formation. Zero G allows for bigger, purer crystals. If we look a few decades into the future, there are many things that could benefit from a space environment (provided launch costs go down, or we use materials readily available in space). Zero-G means you don't need to worry about support. This allows for much more versatile manufacturing methods. For example, right now silicium wafers used for semiconductor manufacturing are 300mm in diameter. Any bigger than that and the wafer flexes too much. In space the wafer won't flex due to gravity, as such you could conceivably have wafers tens of meters in diameter. Space is also a fantastic vacuum, which would really benefit semiconductor manufacture. Another cool thing about space is that liquid droplets will quickly form perfect spheres thanks to surface tension. This is pretty useful for several industrial processes. Zero G also allows you to mix normally unmixable gasses/liquids. Oil and water don't mix on earth, because the oil floats on top of water. In space they'll form a great emulsion for long periods of time. This allows for chemistry that's difficult or impossible on earth. Space is also a great place for dangerous processes. If some industrial accident leaks thousands of tonnes of neurotoxics into the environment its a terrible disaster on earth. In space nobody would give a shit, outside of lost profit. All in all, space manufacture would be pretty useful. But only if launch costs come waaaaay down, or we start exploiting asteroids and set up a nearly independent industry in space.

"If coaxial is good enough to get the signal inside, why do we use all kinds of other connections (HDMI, Ethernet etc...)","Cables are used for power. Coax is used for data. HDMI is used for both. It's all about the signal and the amount of data that is being sent. The more data being sent, the thicker the wire needs to be. For power, a thinner wire is better. Coax is a special type of cable that is used for data transmission. It's the best cable to use for data because it can carry more data than any other cable. HDMI is a special type of cable that can carry both audio and video. It's the best cable to use for audio and video because it can carry more data than any other cable.","The coaxial signal is very high frequency analog. It takes significant electronics to decode it and encode an outgoing signal. The box that does this is called a modem (MOdulator-DEModulator). If you add that electronics to every thing, it would significantly increase the cost, over a digital system like HDMI. High frequency analog signals are also subject to cosite interference when you have more than one of them inside a box, so things would need lots of metal boxes to put the components in. Net result, it would cost a lot more. Because coax is essentially carrying radio signals, and anything working over it includes a full radio transceiver. Essentially it's much more similar to using wifi cards. You could replace your Ethernet connection with wifi cards connected via coax instead of antennas, it would probably work, but it's much more expensive than Ethernet, and significantly slower. It's a similar issue with HDMI, a current HDMI cable can be powered by a $25 raspberry pi zero (so whatever HDMI needs is less than that), but HDMI handles 48Gbps of data, much much more than your $100 cable modem is capable of. While a cable modem using current tech can be made to push 48Gbps over coax, it would really require 100 times the hardware to generate the right signals, making it a $10k modem, and you need one on each end of the cable. Because each of those things have specific standards (physical and electrical) that were developed independently - many of them prior to the introduction of consumer Internet services from cable TV companies. Phones, for example, have used the same cabling, modular connectors, and signalling for 40+ years. Could you run phones directly over coax? Sure, but what would the benefit be compared to the expense of abandoning millions of existing phones. Years ago, we used to run Ethernet over coaxial cable. However, coax tends to be bulky and hard to work with, and the devices used to propagate the signal introduce multiple failure points to the network. So, networking switched over to twisted pair cable in the late 80s/early 90s. TP wiring is easier to work with and is less expensive than coax. HDMI was developed in the early 2000s, to provide higher quality digital AV between devices. It's no coincidence that HDMI came on the heals of wider adoption of DVD, and was developed around the same time as Blu-Ray. Each of the standards is optimized for its specific function and, after the cable comes into your home, the signals the cable company sends must be converted, by your modem, into the type that can be used by the connected device. Another piece of insight here. From what I remember from college. The coaxial cable is essentially lossless. It can be run for miles and miles without signal degradation. You can't do that with ethernet. For simplicity sake, essentially you can't run Cat5e more than 100 meters (~300+ feet) at a time without a repeater to regenerate the signal and send it out again. Cat6 is the same at 1000base-T but it's more often used for 10GBase-T, or 10 gigabit per second rate, which means its maximum distance is about 55 meters. HDMI is the same story, topping out at 50 feet before signal degradation. [Here's a decent source]( URL_1 ) Notice the RG-59 Coax doesn't show a max length. IIRC from college, that's thanks to shielding and most importantly, impedance matching. [Wikipedia sources for support]( URL_0 ) Especially the ""matched load"" section there where it says ""for all l."" If you tried to do the same thing that Coax is used for by using ethernet cables, it would cost you a fortune in repeaters alone. You can't do everything with Coax either. It has limits on splits. It's better for getting signal between 2 points, but not well suited for your network backbone like ethernet. There are pros and cons to all types of cables and their usefulness depends on application needs.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 67.24, 'recall': 11.4, 'fmeasure': 19.5}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.91, 'recall': 2.34, 'fmeasure': 4.01}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.62, 'recall': 5.7, 'fmeasure': 9.75}}"
What is the purpose of this structure in a dam?," I don’t know what you mean by “structure in a dam” but I’m going to guess that you’re talking about the dam’s spillway. The spillway is the structure that allows water to flow over the top of the dam. It’s designed to be able to handle a certain amount of water flow, and when that amount is exceeded, the spillway will open to release the excess water. This is important because if too much water builds up behind the dam, it can cause the dam to fail. The dam’s spillway is also used to control the water level behind the dam. If the water level is getting too high, the spillway can be opened to reduce the water level. The spillway is also used to control the water flow rate. If the water flow rate is getting too high, the spillway can be opened to reduce the water flow rate. This is important because if the water flow rate is too high, it can cause erosion of the dam.","Looks like an overflow emergency drain. In the event the level behind the dam gets too high, this structure, which is connected by pipe to a sluice way, allows water to drain without letting the dam be topped, which can be damaging to the dam structure.

How does my car know if it is icy outside?," in the 1980's there were cars that had sensors that could detect moisture in the air. the sensors were called ""wet sensors"". they were used to detect the presence of moisture in the air and to calculate the amount of moisture present. the moisture could be in the form of fog, rain, or snow. the sensors were used in the early 1980's but were discontinued. nowadays, moisture sensors are used in vehicles to detect moisture in the air. these sensors are called ""wet-bulb sensors"". they are used to measure the temperature and humidity of the air. the temperature is measured using a thermometer, and the humidity is measured using a hygrometer. the temperature is measured in degrees fahrenheit, and the humidity is measured in percentage. the temperature is usually between 32 and 100 degrees fahrenheit. the humidity is usually between 0 and 100%. the sensors are connected to a microcontroller which is connected to the engine control module. the engine control module is connected to the engine. when the sensors detect moisture in the air, the microcontroller sends a signal to the engine control module. the engine control module then sends a signal to the engine to reduce its power output.

They require power steering and have no way to work if the power fails. They also don't make it easy to give physical feedback to their driver. I can't think of anything better than a wheel. You can turn it many times to get to full lock which makes it great for manoeuvring and parking. It won't accidentally get turned too much while the car is moving at speed. It's easy to keep it turned to the same degree - you just hold it in place where as a joystick is more work. It is NOT the singular design. Early automobiles had many different control designs. Ford model T has 3 foot pedals: brake, reverse and clutch. And 2 hand levers: ebrake/mode lever and gear selector. The throttle is a hand lever on the steering column I'd say the steering wheel actually has changed a lot. Think of all of the technology now present in a steering wheel- first it connects to a power steering system that assists you in turning the vehicle, rather than using brute strength. Next, think of all the buttons for things such as cruise control, and media center control. Finally, the steering wheel is now part of the safety design of a car, with an airbag inside to protect you in the event of a collision. On the contrary, steering wheels have been endlessly tweaked and redesigned. The shape, auxiliary controls, angle, displays, etc have all been changed -- the only constant is that it's a ""thing you turn"". For example, here's a gif of how Formula 1 steering wheels have evolved over the decades: [F1wheels]( URL_0 ) Lots of early cars didn't have accelerator pedals like cars do today; many ran at a fixed acceleration (ie, ON), and you used gears to change your speed (roughly; 1= 5mph, 2 =12mph, 3=20mph, etc).

The blue lenses are used to filter out the blue light in the image, while the red lenses filter out the red light.   3D effect.

The blue lenses are used to filter out the blue light in the image, while the red lenses filter out the red light.  ","The key idea of any 3d is to project 2 images on to the screen, and have each eye register only one of them. With red/blue, you would show one image in only blue color, and another image in only red color, using different shades of red. If you looked at the entirely-red-shades image through lens that was color red, you would see just, well, red. But if you saw it through blue lens, you would see all the different shades. Likewise for blue. Thus, you get(with wonky colors) 2 different images, one for each eye, which then could be used to do 3d. Modern tech however uses polarization, that is, the direction light is sorta ""waving"" at. Light is a wave, and it has direction, orthogonal to the direction it's going, where it's ""waving"" at. Typically white light does this waving thing in all sorts of directions, and it's a mess, but there are filters which can block all but certain orientation of this waving. Having one image transmitted only using light that's of certain orientation, and then have lenses of your glasses selectively block these orientations allows again you to transmit only one of the two images to both eyes. I don't know how expensive this new polarization technique is, but I can tell you that you can do pretty good job with this red/blue lens thing with very cheap materials, video device you use to show your red/blue 3d film has absolutely no special requirements, and it's pretty cheap to make appropriate glasses, so that probably explains why people historically did use this red/blue 3d thing despite color problems. Polarized light is the secret. To your eye, polarized light looks like normal light. Normal light has waves, right? Normally, these waves kinda bounce every which way. But with a filter, you can ensure the waves only go one way, for example vertical. So what the 3D projector does is show two images, one composed of vertically poliarized light, one of horizontally polarized light, on top of each other. One glasses lens filters the one polarization, and the other filters the other polarization. So each eye now sees a different image. [Here's a handy lil diagram]( URL_0 ). For the other lens, the opposite would be true, the horizontal light would get past the filter but the vertical would not.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.06, 'recall': 24.88, 'fmeasure': 34.65}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.7, 'recall': 0.74, 'fmeasure': 1.03}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.42, 'recall': 11.08, 'fmeasure': 15.44}}"

"Why has my town installed dual traffic lights at a busy roundabout, I thought the point of a roundabout was to keep traffic flowing and replace traffic lights.","In the UK, traffic lights are used to control traffic flow, rather than to stop it. This is because the roads are designed to be wide and have multiple lanes, so they can handle a lot of traffic. The idea is that traffic lights will help to control the flow of traffic, rather than to stop it. The reason for this is that in the UK, it is very important to keep traffic moving. There are a lot of small towns and villages, and they are all connected by a network of roads. If traffic is slowed down, it can cause a lot of problems. There are a lot of people who have to commute to work, and if traffic is slow, they will be late. There are also a lot of people who have to travel long distances to go to the shops, or to visit friends and family. If traffic is slow, they will be late. This is why the UK has a lot of traffic lights, and why they are used to control traffic flow. If traffic is slowed down, it can cause a lot of problems. This is why the UK has a lot of traffic lights, and why they are used to control traffic flow.","Roundabouts work very well when the traffic on both roads is approximately equal. Vehicles turning off one street create gaps in the traffic to let vehicles from the side street on, allowing an even use of the intersection. But if one road dominates with only through traffic, then side street traffic has no opportunity to get onto the roundabout. So occasionally they need to put stoplights on the through street, to allow cross-street traffic onto the roundabout and clear. I don't know where you are, but in the UK, roundabouts often have traffic lights. Traffic lights on their own can cause a queue of people waiting to turn right (that's in the UK where we drive on the left - if you drive on the right in your country then there'll be a queue of people waiting to turn left instead), as well as traffic being forced to stop at a red light. Roundabouts on their own get around these problems. Traffic turning right (in the UK - left if you drive on the right hand side of the road) can enter the roundabout at the same time as everyone else and keep moving, and you only have to stop if there's someone on the roundabout that has right of way. But roundabouts on their own bring their own set of problems. At a busy junction, traffic on the roundabout has priority, which can make it difficult for traffic to enter the junction, and result in queues on all of the entrances to the roundabout. And if you're entering from a quiet entrance (where not many people exit) then it can be long wait for a gap when the roundabout is busy. Traffic lights at roundabouts attempt to solve all of these problems. They're often only active during peak hours, because the problems with roundabouts don't occur when it's quiet. But during peak hours, they can give some priority to joining traffic (but never so much that there's gridlock on the roundabout itself - it's important that traffic on the roundabout be given more priority), and they can also create breaks in the traffic so that it's possible to join from quiet entrances.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 54.29, 'recall': 30.65, 'fmeasure': 39.18}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.0, 'recall': 6.2, 'fmeasure': 7.93}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.29, 'recall': 13.71, 'fmeasure': 17.53}}"
What a civil engineer does,"Civil engineers are the people that design and build bridges, roads, buildings, water supply systems, and sewage treatment plants.

Civil engineers are also involved in the planning of large projects like urban development, traffic management, and public transportation.

A civil engineer with a master’s degree can earn between $80,000 and $130,000 per year. A civil engineer with a Ph.D. can earn between $120,000 and $150,000 per year.  ","How unlike a civil engineer to give a super convoluted answer to a simple question. /s. Seriously - I asked a civil engineer once how they like their coffee and they gave me a 20 page report. :-P The reason your boyfriend gives a convoluted answer though is because what he does is actually an extremely complicated job. The very short answer though is that they build stuff. Stuff like roads, bridges, tunnels, buildings, etc, etc, etc But it's not the actual building that they do (construction crews do that) - they more do work kind of like an architect but more complex - their job is to make sure that what is being built will fit into the environment it is being built in and will be suitable for the purpose it is being built in. Or (quite often) making sure that something that has already been built continues to be fit for it's purpose or can be repaired so that it once again becomes fit for it's purpose. For example: A civil engineer building a road will make sure it will be able to be built for the environment it is in (i.e. it won't crack or subside), that it will be able to handle the amount of traffic it will need, that the construction crew will actually be able to build it, etc, etc. And all of this with a budget about half of what he actually needs. Civil engineers work on systems where the sum of the forces equals zero, i.e. there is *no* net acceleration. For example roads, bridges, dams. Mechanical engineers work on systems where the sum of the forces does not equal zero, i.e. there *is* a net acceleration in some direction.

Where does excess power generated by solar panels go?,"Most of it is used by the homeowner. A solar panel system is designed to produce more power than the homeowner needs, so the excess power is fed back into the grid. This is called ""exporting"" power. The power is sold to the utility company, which is then sold to other customers. The customer is paid for the power that they export.","I work in a building which is completely off the grid and is not connected to mains electricity lines. We have a row of twelve solar panels on the side of the building which generate electricity by absorbing the Sun's rays. The building's electrical appliances and lights don't use much electricity, so the panels can sometimes generate more electricity than is needed. In a room of the building, conneceted to the solar panels, are four large batteries. These batteries are similar to those you would find in a car but are larger and can store more electricity. The excess electricity not used by the building is pushed into and stored in these batteries. This means we can access that supply of electricity when the Sun is not in the sky or on cloudy days. In the event that the batteries were full and we weren't using any electricity, the solar panels system would stop generating electricity until it was needed again. Solar panels will act as a heater if the power is not used. Similar to how an engine that is not connected to anything will just make heat and noise. The electricity will just be heating up the wires and the panels themselves. It doesn't generate power that it doesn't use. Sunlight displaces electrons in the solar panel. If those electrons can't go anywhere then as each electron is moved there are fewer electrons left behind to move. Meanwhile the abundance of displaced electrons makes moving more electrons more-and-more difficult. Soon the sunlight is not moving any electrons at all. This is the same reason that batteries don't discharge (as fast) when the device they are in is turned off. It's also why your car battery might be _able_ to push ""500 cold-cranking amps"" but it is not normally moving anywhere near that much current. So the sunlight is a mechanical force. And ""voltage"" is ""electromotive force"" (that's the technical name for voltage). If nothing is using that voltage... if no ""current"" is being drawn... then the forces of electricity and sunlight reach equilibrium and the cells do _nothing_. So if your building has the _potential_ to generate twice as much power as it uses... it still only _actually_ generates as much power as it uses, and the extra potential is just meaningless. What normally happens in such a design is that you add batteries to store some energy for darker times, or you hook up to the grid and generate 100% of your potential, use half, and sell the other half to the grid. In other terms, I can reasonably lift fifty pounds, but I rarely lift more than ten. It's improper to ask ""what happened to the other forty pounds"" because they don't exist. That forty pounds didn't ""go anywhere"". It was never there at all. Same for the capacity of the panels to generate XXX current. If you only use the lessor YY current, then that's all that's generated. Same for your house on the grid. The grid _could_ supply enough power to melt your entire house in bright electric arcs. But since you never ask it for that kind of power it never happens. (And we have circuit breakers and fuses that prevent that request being filled if you should have something break and so ask for that kind of power.) So that's why turning off appliances and lights ""saves power"" by eliminating the place where such power might go, and so eliminating its actual production. TL;DR :: Electricity, when it piles up has ""back-pressure"" because that's how ""electrical charge"" works. That back-pressure slows or stops the generation of electricity in solar panels so that only as much as you use can actually be generated.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 72.58, 'recall': 7.01, 'fmeasure': 12.78}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 22.95, 'recall': 2.18, 'fmeasure': 3.99}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 46.77, 'recall': 4.52, 'fmeasure': 8.24}}"
Why does gas you get in the US have so much lower octane numers than in germany?,"The higher octane number doesn’t necessarily mean that the fuel is more refined or has a higher energy density. The difference in octane rating between US and European fuels is mostly due to differences in the fuel blends, additives and refining processes. The US has a much more varied fuel market than Europe, with many different fuel blends available. In the US, most fuel is blended with a 10% ethanol content. Ethanol is a more efficient fuel than gasoline, but it also has a lower energy density. Ethanol blends are usually denoted by a “E” number, which ranges from E0 (no ethanol) to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). The E0 and E10 blends are the most common in the US. In Europe, most fuel is blended with a 5% ethanol content, and most countries have a ban on the sale of E10 blends. Ethanol is not used in Europe at all. The US also has a much higher concentration of gasoline retailers that blend their own fuel, whereas in Europe, most retailers buy their fuel from a few major refineries. Some of these refineries also blend their own fuel.  ","Your octane numbers and our octane numbers don't mean the same thing. From an engineering perspective the octane number is actually a kind of hilariously arbitrary number that basically boils down a bunch of different fuel qualities, that all both individually *and* collectively control a fuel's likelihood to knock, all into a single number, and because of that the precise testing for octane numbers changes depending on the body doing the regulation. So it would be entirely possible for two utterly identical batches of fuel to get different octane ratings when tested by different countries. However, our fuels are also slightly different, as Europe is going to have a slightly different set of additives than we get in the US, but that doesn't really account for most of the difference; the differing standards do. It's not. US and Canada uses RON(Research Octane Number)to measure octane while most of the world uses AKI(Anti-Knock Index). 87RON is the same as 90AKI for a reference point. There are different ways of rating octane. The fuel is the same. From Wikipedia: Research Octane Number (RON) The most common type of octane rating worldwide is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine with a variable compression ratio under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane. Motor Octane Number (MON) Another type of octane rating, called Motor Octane Number (MON), is determined at 900 rpm engine speed instead of the 600 rpm for RON.[1] MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, higher engine speed, and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel's knock resistance. Depending on the composition of the fuel, the MON of a modern pump gasoline will be about 8 to 12 octane lower than the RON, but there is no direct link between RON and MON. Pump gasoline specifications typically require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.[citation needed] Anti-Knock Index (AKI) or (R+M)/2 In most countries, including Australia, New Zealand and all of those in Europe,[citation needed] the ""headline"" octane rating shown on the pump is the RON, but in Canada, the United States, Brazil, and some other countries, the headline number is the average of the RON and the MON, called the Anti-Knock Index (AKI), and often written on pumps as (R+M)/2). It may also sometimes be called the Posted Octane Number (PON). Difference between RON, MON, and AKI Because of the 8 to 12 octane number difference between RON and MON noted above, the AKI shown in Canada and the United States is 4 to 6 octane numbers lower than elsewhere in the world for the same fuel. This difference between RON and MON is known as the fuel's Sensitivity,[4] and is not typically published for those countries that use the Anti-Knock Index labelling system. See the table in the following section for a comparison. Observed Road Octane Number (RdON) Another type of octane rating, called Observed Road Octane Number (RdON), is derived from testing gasolines in real world multi-cylinder engines, normally at wide open throttle. It was developed in the 1920s and is still reliable today. The original testing was done in cars on the road but as technology developed the testing was moved to chassis dynamometers with environmental controls to improve consistency.[5] In the US octane is calculated two different ways and then averaged over those calculations (IE (rating1 + rating 2)/2). What this does is show a ""lower"" octane rating for US gas in general compared to EU countries because in Europe they only calculate octane once (no /2). As for WHY we don't make more other octane levels rather than the ""standard"" 87/89/91 is because of cost. Not long ago I could go to *some* gas stations and fill up with 95 octane (Sunoco for example 20 years ago) if I so chose, but those days are long gone because no cars sold in the US require that much octane and nobody wants to spend extra money filling up with more octane than is required. You CAN however go buy cans of octane boost if you choose at pretty much any auto store which advertise up to 101 octane per tank. Octane primarily deals with the ignition pressure of the fuel. Lower octane fuel will self ignite (without a spark) at lower pressure than higher octane fuel. Cars with engines that operate with high compression ratios (mostly turbo charged and otherwise high performance engines) need higher octane fuel so that the gas doesn't pre-ignite and screw up engine timing/efficiency/performance. Because if it pre-ignites the fuel in the cylinder, not all of the gas will burn off, so the exhaust mix is screwed up, which makes the sensors angry, and you use more fuel than you should, and you lose some output power. As someone who has almost exclusively had German cars, and a former employee of a Volkswagen/Audi/Porsche dealer, I can tell you that there are very few German cars produced in the last 25 years or so that don't require high octane fuel, because of high compression. So this is a factor, as well.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 64.21, 'recall': 13.48, 'fmeasure': 22.28}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.4, 'recall': 3.43, 'fmeasure': 5.67}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.05, 'recall': 6.52, 'fmeasure': 10.78}}"

","There are a lot of moving parts to explain, and it is difficult through text, but essentially when you pull the trigger a 6 notch cam wheel doesn't allow the trigger to reengage and stop the bolt until the cam wheel has rotated half way around. The reason that it is 6 notches and only rotates half way around is because there are four shallow notches and two deep notches in that wheel. In this order. Deep, shallow, shallow, deep, shallow shallow. When the trigger is resting in the deep notches it doesn't allow the bolt to engage, however when pulled it engages the bolt, firing a round, then the wheel rotates to a shallow notch which does not prevent the bolt from engaging and thus fires the second round, then the wheel rotates to the next shallow notch which again does not prevent the bolt from engaging and thus fires the third round, the wheel then again rotates but this time to the next deep notch which allows the trigger to prevent the bolt from engaging a fourth time. So each three round burst rotates that cam wheel half way around, bringing it to the next deep notch which brings the bolt to rest. There are more moving parts but this is a basic explanation. Anything further would require illustration. Note that this is pretty much the most basic version, generally referred to as the Eugene Stoner. There are many variations as well, some are much much more complicated, especially if the weapon has a fully automatic option as well.

"How is 'memory foam' (I.E. memory foam mattress, pillow) made?",The memory foam is made from a chemical reaction of a liquid polyol with a liquid isocyanate. The polyol and isocyanate react to form a cross-linked polyurethane. The reaction is usually done at room temperature and the polyurethane is then cured to form a solid. The polyurethane is then cut into small pieces and mixed with a chemical blowing agent to expand the material. The expanded foam is then cut into the desired shape.,"This is actually more of a chemistry related topic, but essentially foams in pillows/mattresses are created from polyurethane foams. Two major chemicals are used in the polyurethane production and other chemicals are used to adjust the rate of reaction to tweak the final product. The first chemical is some form of isocyanate, if we're talking mattresses then this is a semi-rigid foam and probably uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) in the reaction. The second major chemical is referred to as a ""Polyol"" (essentially this means that it has multiple OH (alcohol) groups on the molecule, meaning that there is a high variance in the type of molecule you can use). A catalyst (typically nitrogen based) is used to initiate a polymerization reaction between the isocyanate group and the alcohol groups. The reaction releases CO2 as a bi-product which produces bubbles and causes the rising of the foam. The presence of the CO2 throughout the foam is what causes the formation of the pores in the foam. The reaction continues until it is finished and cross linking can occur between the polymer chains to increase the rigidity. Like I said, other chemicals come into play such as surfactants, catalysts,etc. which will determine the overall foam product's rigidity, porosity,etc. This is a fairly difficult process to perfect and is actually considered one of the most difficult branches of chemistry. -Source: Worked in a polyurethane foam manufacturing company","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.33, 'recall': 17.84, 'fmeasure': 27.22}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.76, 'recall': 2.08, 'fmeasure': 3.18}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.0, 'recall': 9.96, 'fmeasure': 15.19}}"
What would happen if I put a burning matchstick in the petrol tank of a bike/car?,"I've seen this done to a car. It was a '69 Mustang, but I'm sure it'd be the same for any car. The fuel system is designed to handle a lot of fuel flow at once, but not a lot of fuel flow constantly. The pump is designed to take a little fuel, then shut off and wait for a little more fuel before taking more. This allows the engine to run smoothly, without stalling. However, when the fuel flow is constant, the pump doesn't shut off and doesn't get a chance to rest. This means the pump burns out much faster than it should. The car would stall out after a few miles. The fuel tank is also designed to handle a lot of fuel flow at once, but not a lot of fuel flow constantly. The tank is vented, so if the fuel level gets too high, it'll start to vent gas out the top. If you put a match in the tank, it would burn the fuel out of the tank and cause the car to stall out. The gas tank is vented, so it will just vent gas out the top. This will cause the car to stall out.","Most likely, nothing. The inside of the tank is full of gasoline fumes, sure, but that's mostly what's in there. There's not enough oxygen inside the tank to support a quick flash, much less a full-on explosion. Now, if the tank was completely empty of liquid and only had fumes in there and there had been time for some regular outside air to mix in, then you might get something. The proper stoichiometric ratio for gasoline to detonate is about 15 parts air to 1 part fuel, so you need a *lot* of air in the tank to get a proper boom. Generally nothing.

Argument that oil bi products used to make and maintain wind turbines makes them just as environmentally problematic as oil.,"The main problem is the production of turbines and the energy required to run them. A wind turbine is made up of a lot of materials that have to be manufactured. The turbine blades are made of fiberglass, which is made from petroleum. The tower is made of steel, which is made from iron ore, which is mined from the ground and smelted in a blast furnace. The turbine itself is made of a lot of parts, including the gearbox, the generator, and the control electronics. Each of these parts has to be made from materials that are strong enough to withstand the wind and the weather. The turbine has to be designed to be efficient, so that it can produce enough electricity to pay for itself. To do this, it has to be big enough to capture a lot of wind energy. That means it has to be tall. The taller the turbine, the bigger the blades. The bigger the blades, the more energy they can capture. But the bigger the blades, the heavier they are. That means the turbine has to be stronger. The stronger the turbine, the more energy it can capture. But the stronger the turbine, the more materials it needs. That means more steel, more fiberglass, more electronics. That means more energy used to make the turbine.  ","It's called a ""Life Cycle Analysis"", which means understanding and calculating the amount of energy and costs associated with producing components, shipping them, maintaining them, and then eventually disposing or recycling them.

The Mongols conquered the known world not because their troops were unbeatable - they were tactically dominant on the plains, but not in bogs or mountain passes - but because every warrior carried his entire kit on his horse and could forage for himself, so they were not dependent on vulnerable supply trains.

"Why do we need so many different types of screw heads? Straight, Phillips, Torx, Square, Hexagon, etc... couldn't we settle on just a few?","Screws are used in a wide variety of applications, and they are used in different ways. Screws can be used for holding parts together, or they can be used to make a connection that allows the parts to move. They can be used to transfer forces from one part to another, or they can be used to transfer a force from one part to another and then back to the first part. Different screw head shapes are used for different purposes. For example, a straight screw head is best for making a connection that allows a part to move, because the screw head is wide enough to provide a good surface for the screw to move along. A Phillips head is best for making a connection that is strong enough to transfer forces from one part to another, because the screw head is wide enough to provide a good surface for the screw to make contact with the part, and the screw head is rounded enough to allow the screw to make good contact with the part. A Torx head is best for making a connection that is strong enough to transfer forces from one part to another, because the screw head is wide enough to provide a good surface for the screw to make contact with the part, and the screw head is rounded enough to allow the screw to make good contact with the part.  ","They weren't all introduced at the same time, and therefore have to compete with each-other for market share. Originally there was only flat-head, this is because you can make a flat-head screw and driver very easily. Before there were different types of screws, they called the driver a ""Turnscrew"" Then somebody thought to themselves ""If there were two slots, like an X then the Turnscrew would be a bit harder to make but wouldn't slide out of the screw all the time. (this guys name was probably Phillips, not actually sure though) This idea worked quite well and so there were now two standards. They both co-exist because X is definitely better to work with, but the slot is always going to be cheaper and easier to make. Eventually a third person decided that the way that Phillips pops out if you apply too much torque is sub-optimal, so they came up with Robertson (Square type) This system managed to catch on quite well, but not become very widespread. This type is a little more expensive to make the screws than Phillips, but a little cheaper to make the drivers too. Now we have three competing standards. All of which have their strengths and weaknesses. All of which are able to take a viable slice of the market and compete with each-other. The other standards you've mentioned all came into the market in a similar manner, but I'm telling the story of the big three types because it's way simpler to explain the concept that way. The simplest screw head, the flat head, allows your tool to slide out at the slightest misalignment. Phillips heads solved that problem, but introduced another: the screws strip easily when the driver cams out due to excessive torque. Newer designs have different balances of torque protection, size, manufacturing ease, etc. You also have a bit of this going on: URL_0 There's a lot of reasons, and many other answers have hit the high points. In general, ""sophisticated machinery"" means ""it's more expensive to make."" * ""Flathead"" screws were created first because they're the easiest to make and didn't require sophisticated machinery. * ""Phillips head"" screws were created later because it takes more sophisticated machining to create them. They're easier to screw in than flat heads, but can be subject to ""stripping"" that makes reuse impossible. * They are, by design, subject to a problem called ""cam-out"", that means the screwdriver might slip and stop applying force. In good Phillips screws, this stops you from over-tightening the screws. In cheap Phillips screws, this makes it impossible to properly tighten them without stripping. * ""Robertson"" screws were created to deal with the stripping problems of Phillips heads, but take more sophisticated machinery to create. * Torx and Hex screws are alternate ways to try and address the problems with Phillips heads, and also require sophisticated machinery. (I think it's possible Torx was trademarked * Robertson, Torx, and Hex are more resistant to ""cam-out"". That means you're less likely to strip them, but you can also over-tighten them without a more sophisticated screwdriver designed to prevent over-tightening. * A few other head types exist and are called ""security bits"". The goal here is either to make a screw few people will have a screwdriver to turn, or in some cases make it very difficult to unscrew the screw without causing damage. These are for applications like public restroom stalls, where you don't want vandals to unscrew your screws. Common security bits have tri-wing, square, and triangular heads, but many tighten-only screws have drivers that look sort of like bottle openers. So the reasons so many heads exist are: * Some screws are really cheap to make, and the cheapest possible solution will always exist even if it's very bad. * Some screws were designed to be easier to use than the cheaper ones, but are more expensive and have varying problems with over-tightening or stripping. * Some screws are designed in the hopes that you don't have a screwdriver for them, so you don't mess with them. That's sort of why a lot of car mechanisms use different screws on one part. The manufacturer is trying to make it so the average person with a cheap toolset won't be able to properly disassemble and reassemble the mechanisms. But the licensed, ""qualified"" mechanic's shop will have all of the necessary tools. Don't ask me why they tend to replace all of the screws with inferior, half-broken ones. That probably has to do with the ""cheaper"" reason. Different tools for different jobs. A standard screw is simplest and works will with hand tools. A Phillips screw is good with a machine driver, because it is less likely to slip. A Torx screw is less likely to slip than a Phillips, so it is better when a screw has to be really tight, but it is harder to align initially. A hex screw is good when you are selling assemble yourself furniture and way to provide a single cheap tool that can do all the work. The older ones are simpler to make the screw and the tool. As machining methods have improved we've been able to design more complex screws/drivers to overcome the flaws in the old designs. The old designs are still used because they are very inexpensive to make and there are no licensing fees associated with the design.

how do touch lamps actually work?,"They have a tiny light bulb that is activated by a small electrical charge.

Keep in mind most buildings if properly maintained will will last until something catastrophic happens to it or maintanence stops and they decay and become unsafe. Structural Engineer here. The design life of a structure is determined in coordination with the person building it. Whilst having a building that can survive any wind or earthquake event imaginable would be ideal, the trade off is increased construction cost, so normally people go for the minimum allowed, unless the building is needed post disaster. In my country, we typically design for what we call a fifty year design life. For typically buildings, (not hospitals or other important buildings) a fifty year design life relates to a 1/2500 annual probability that a large wind or earthquake event would occur. The longer the design life, the opportunity for a large event becomes more likely, so the structure needs to be come stronger as a result. So in terms of actual structural performance, the structure can survive indefinitely (with maintaince), until the large scale event occurs. The second issue affecting the longevity of a structure is corrosion. Steel obviously rusts over time, so left unintended over time steel will corrode, and eventually break. This can be prolonged with regular maintenance (i.e. Painting or other protective coatings), but eventually the steel will corrode and fail (spectacularly). You can continually swap out rusted steel for new steel, but at some point this gets more expensive than its worth.

How is Geometric Stiffness different to Young's Modulus?,Young's Modulus is a measure of how much a material will stretch. Geometric Stiffness is a measure of how much a material will bend.

It is also called modulus of elasticity.,"The basic difference is that Young's Modulus ""E"" is a material property, and the geometric stiffness ""k"" depends on the geometry of the situation as well as the Young's modulus of the material. Specifically, k = E * A/L, where A is the cross-sectional area and L is the length of the specimen. This relationship makes sense physically: if you think of the resistance of a spring to being pulled, a thicker or shorter spring will be more stiff. A spring of the same dimensions will be more stiff when made out of steel than out of rubber because E of steel is much larger than E of rubber.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.88, 'recall': 27.03, 'fmeasure': 34.29}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.7, 'recall': 7.27, 'fmeasure': 9.25}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.81, 'recall': 18.92, 'fmeasure': 24.0}}"

This means NP-hard problems are *at least as ""hard"" to solve* as *the hardest problems in NP*. After all, since the translation is ""easy"", we can solve any NP problem by translating it and then solving the NP-hard problem instead. NP-complete is yet a third class of problems, but it's simply the intersection of NP and NP-hard.

Shockwaves do something similar. When there's an earthquake, the shockwaves are detected [in many parts of the world]( URL_0 ). By measuring them carefully, scientists can figure out the path they took and what kind of materials they passed through, allowing them over time to build up a fair model of what's inside the planet. Add to that a lot of other observations, like the existence of a magnetic field, and some basic scientific rules about how different materials behave at different pressures and temperatures, and scientists can make some pretty good guesses as to what the internal structure must be. Geophysics! - The mathematically based study of various physical properties of the Earth. This is then elaborated on with mechanical and chemical lab experiments, and data fed into numerical models to get the best picture of what's down there. In fact, we've had some idea that the Earth's centre had some crazy dense stuff for a long time - Newton's maths of gravity can give us the mass of the Earth. Divide this by the volume and you get the average density of the Earth, which is well outside the range of rock densities seen at the Earth's surface. Even the deep rocks occasionally belched up by volcanoes or exposed in certain places were not dense enough to account for the average density, so it was long hypothesised that a much denser core existed. Fast forward to the second half of the 20th Century and we started to use seismic waves to get an idea of our Earth's structure. This has been the most fruitful method - specifically, timing how long the waves take to travel through various parts of the Earth reveal changes in density (some sharp, some graded), as different materials have different physical properties and so change the speed of wave propagation. The fact some waves do not travel through part of the Earth at all indicates that it is molten - this is the outer core. Shear waves cannot propagate through this liquid outer core as they move via deformation of the medium, and liquids have no rigidity to deform. The global network of seismometers used to detect all this is also used to detect nuclear tests. This network and the computing power used to process data from them has advanced sufficiently to allow a sub-field known as seismic tomography - in which cross sectional images of the Earth's implied density and temperature (which also affects wave speeds) can be produced at a higher resolution than other seismic wave studies, giving a three dimensional view of structures such as rising plumes through the mantle if the cross sections are stacked. The actual composition of the Earth's layers has been determined by observing how various materials behave when subjected to high pressure and temperature experiments in the lab. The graded changes in density occur due to elements getting squished together with increasing pressure in the Earth to form different minerals the deeper you go (but made up of the same elements). The sharp changes in density occur due to a change in the elements that make up that particular layer. Iron fits the bill for the Earth's core as it has to be a metal (to produce the magnetic field), and it also stands up to predictrd density at the relevant temps and pressures. Iron also fits in a cosmic sense - there is a lot of it in the universe due to it being the end result of fusion in stars, and our solar system is no exception - we have iron based meteorites assumed to be fragments of proto-planetary cores from the early solar system.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 38.36, 'recall': 13.99, 'fmeasure': 20.51}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.52, 'recall': 3.46, 'fmeasure': 5.08}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 22.41, 'recall': 8.18, 'fmeasure': 11.98}}"

Why does SpaceX land their rocket on a barge on the ocean?,It’s not a barge. It’s a platform on which they can recover the rocket. The barge is just a platform that is designed to be moved around the ocean. They can then land the rocket on the barge and then move the barge to a port where the rocket can be refueled and then put back into service.,"Because landing on land limits the places you can take off from and the direction you can point your rocket. I believe the first successful test of the rockets did have them go on land, but the goal is to let the rockets take off in the most efficient places to put their payloads into orbit. If that means taking off over the ocean, then they need to have a landing spot on the ocean. It primarily has to do with fuel. To get back to land, the first stage must burn more fuel to do an about face. This is fuel it doesn't have to spare if it needs to get the satellite to geostationary (a higher) orbit. Therefore it is easier to just 'keep going' in a parabola shape and land in the ocean. For low earth orbit, like ISS resupply missions, it has enough fuel to do that extra burn and return to land. Your launchpad is in Florida, and your launching eastward. There happens to be a big ocean eastward of Cape Canaveral. Nowhere for you to land on. If you flew all the way back to the launchpad, that means you have to carry more fuel. If you just turn and execute a burn to eliminate forward momentum, that gets you to drop straight down and land on a barge in middle of ocean.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.33, 'recall': 15.22, 'fmeasure': 24.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.47, 'recall': 2.18, 'fmeasure': 3.47}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.33, 'recall': 8.7, 'fmeasure': 13.79}}"
Technical debt,"is the cost of choosing short-term solutions over long-term sustainable solutions. Pursuing a short-term solution, like a quick fix, might make things easier in the short term but it makes things much more difficult in the long term. For example, if a company has a software system that is costly to maintain and needs to be replaced, they might choose to use a cheaper system that is less efficient and more difficult to maintain. This cheaper system might be easier to implement and might save money in the short term but it will be more expensive in the long term. The cost of maintaining that system will increase over time and it will be more difficult to fix bugs and make changes. This is an example of technical debt because the company chose a short-term solution over a long-term sustainable solution. In software development, technical debt is the cost of implementing a quick fix or a short-term solution over a long-term sustainable solution. This is a common problem in software development. When a company wants to release a new product quickly, they might choose to cut corners and implement a quick fix, like a temporary solution, rather than a long-term sustainable solution. This can save time and money in the short term but it can increase the cost of maintaining and fixing bugs in the long term.  ","Technical debt is the software engineering buzzword for taking shortcuts that come back to bite you later. Now, maybe you *had* to take a shortcut to launch your thing on time, or maybe you're just a lazy POS. In my experience in software, it's a 50/50 mix. Here are some possible types of technical debt (not an exhaustive list): * Lack of tests. This is important for projects with large teams because the original author of some code isn't necessarily going to be there to review changes from other team members. The reason this is debt is because future well-intentioned changes could cause a regression in behavior, which will waste significantly more time with rolling back builds, finding culprit changelists, rolling back code (or fixing forward, not recommended 99% of the time), finding the bug, and rolling forward. * Poor encapsulation. Encapsulation is the idea that a chunk of code should be mostly self-contained, with anything not self-contained being established and documented. Think of it like an electrical system in a house: External influences are well documented (different plug types), the main logic lives in one spot (breaker box). However, let's now imagine that, because it was easier to do at the time and it saved construction time (somehow), the only way to reset your breaker box is to flush your toilet. This would be an example of poor encapsulation. (Now let's say you had to replace your toilet, and... oh no, you have to completely unwind your electrical system to be able to get at the toilet. Looks like a weekend project just became a 2 week project.) * Hacks. A hack is a form of a shortcut taken because it's trivially easy to do, even if not a great idea. [Here is an example of a hack outside of software.]( URL_0 ) This could be a fairly well-contained hack (like say calling a function that hits your server infinitely until it works instead of backing off if you detect an outage, since you just have to delete that one chunk of code and rewrite it), or it could be systemic (""If I just give the whole application access to these bytes, it will be way easier to set them from all over the application,"" now you have to rewrite your whole application to fix it). Hacks are incredibly insidious in code, and often lead to more hacks. If a hack is fixed right away, then the cost of the hack was the time spent adding the hack plus the time spent doing it right. Often times, laziness or downward pressure from leadership results in people adding more hacks to work around existing hacks. If you wait long enough for more code to depend on the hack, now you have to spend the time to redo everything around it right, in addition to the spent doing the original thing right. I've seen many projects at my place of employment slowly die due to accruing technical debt. As it grows, your ability to get work done in a timely manner shrinks, until you're spending 3 months getting something done that should have taken a week at most. It's a common agile software term. When you start making part of a program before other parts, you do work (spend $) and you get a part of the software. Let's say it's 1/2 of the software. Later on, when you're figuring out the next chunk of software, you notice that 10% of the code you already made has to be redone. This ""technical debt"" of 5% of your project is a debt you took on (perhaps without intending to) when you implemented the first half of the code.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 48.51, 'recall': 18.1, 'fmeasure': 26.36}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.11, 'recall': 4.13, 'fmeasure': 6.03}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 22.98, 'recall': 8.57, 'fmeasure': 12.49}}"
How does tap water get to your house?," Cities typically use one of three methods to transport water. The most common is called a ""gravity-fed system.""

The second most common method is called a ""pressure-fed system."" This is where the water is pumped up to a higher elevation and then pumped back down to your house. This method is used in areas where the elevation is too high to use gravity. The third method is called a ""membrane-fed system."" This is where the water is pumped up to a higher elevation and then filtered through a membrane. This is the most expensive method, but it gives the purest water.","Basically, you have the water lines in the streets. These are large, high-pressure pipes, carrying fresh water. So, when a new house is built, the company who laid those pipes adds a new, smaller pipe to your house. That water is distributed over many small lines inside your house. Now, there is different systems. Either A) the pressure is sufficient to reach all endpoints(taps, shower etc.) Or B) you have a Pump underground that adds pressure to it. This one is the more common one. Now, to have equal pressure between all taps and floors, generally there are systems in place to keep the pressure on the same level in the house. Though, for showers you have more pressure, usually resulting in a higher flow rate.

There's less incentive to fire people who do poor work or find new ways to save the customer money because there is no extra profit to be made. It's worth mentioning that utility companies typically don't have a lot of margin. They're often considered ""old lady"" stocks because, although they reliably make a return on investment and seldom crash, they're almost never going to see the growth that a non-utility stock can.

Explain how electrical grounding works.,Grounding is a system that allows the flow of electricity to be interrupted in the event of a fault. This is done by providing a direct path for electricity to flow to the earth. This is done by having a conductor that is connected to the grounding system. This conductor is usually made of copper or aluminum. This conductor is usually made of copper or aluminum. This conductor is then connected to the grounding system. This is usually done by drilling a hole in the ground and placing the conductor in the hole. The grounding system is usually made of a large metal plate that is buried in the ground. This plate is usually made of copper or aluminum. The plate is connected to the conductor and the grounding system. This is usually done by screwing the conductor to the plate. The grounding system is usually connected to the electrical system by a grounding rod. This rod is usually made of copper or aluminum. The grounding rod is usually attached to the grounding system and the electrical system by a grounding clamp. The grounding clamp is usually made of copper or aluminum. The grounding clamp is usually attached to the grounding rod and the grounding system. The grounding system is usually connected to the electrical system by a grounding wire.  ,"The concept of ""current only flows in closed loops"" is just wrong, when taken out of the concept of circuits. The reason we can say this is because the way current *actually* works in that you get a buildup of electrons. If you just have a battery with a wire attached to one end, the electrons push out to the end of the wire, but then have nowhere to go, and all the electrons behind them get backed up like a traffic jam. If you connect that wire to the other end of the battery, then the electrons can move forever, since always moving ""forward"" will be possible in a loop. Grounding stuff breaks this ""rule"" because of what an electron ground is. Electrical grounds are basically giant empty spaces where electrons can funnel in. They *can* move in because there is effectively always space for them, whereas on something like a thin copper wire they run out of room really really quickly.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 23.18, 'recall': 31.29, 'fmeasure': 26.63}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.83, 'recall': 2.47, 'fmeasure': 2.1}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.55, 'recall': 19.63, 'fmeasure': 16.71}}"

why does the tech industry advance so much faster than most other industries?,"> Why does the tech industry advance so much faster than most other industries? The tech industry advances faster than other industries for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons is that technology is a driving force for innovation. It's a field that is constantly changing and advancing, and companies need to constantly innovate to keep up with the latest technology. This means that the tech industry is constantly pushing the limits of what is possible, and that means that there is a lot of room for growth. Another reason is that the tech industry is very focused on the future. There are a lot of people who work in the tech industry who are very interested in the future of technology, and that means that they are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to make the industry better. This means that the tech industry is always looking for new ways to make things better, and that means that it is always advancing. Finally, the tech industry is very focused on the customer. Companies that work in the tech industry are constantly trying to make their products better for their customers, and that means that they are constantly trying to innovate. This means that the tech industry is always advancing.","The fastest innovations in tech are in the area of computers and software. The reason innovation happens so fast in that space is that the cost to building and trying out an idea is so small. If you think of an idea, you can try it out and build it right away. Compare that to something like medicine, where it takes years to figure out if a drug is working or not - or mechanical engineering, where it might take weeks or months to physically construct a device or machine to test out an idea. In software, you can think of something, program it, and try it out immediately.

"How are/were bridges built over large bodies of water, both now and before modern technologies?"," Different methods were used for different bridges. The earliest bridges were just logs laid across rivers, and later people started building boats or barges to ferry people and goods across. In the 19th century, when bridges were first being built across rivers, they were often made of wood and suspended on chains or cables. There were also some early suspension bridges made of iron, like the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, but these were very expensive and often collapsed. In the 20th century, steel and concrete replaced iron, and suspension bridges became much more common. For example, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco was built in 1937 and is still one of the longest suspension bridges in the world. Today, the most common way to build a bridge is to build a series of smaller bridges on top of each other. This is called a cable-stayed bridge. Cable-stayed bridges are often made of steel, and are very strong and stable. The most famous cable-stayed bridge in the world is probably the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia. It was built in 1932, and it is still one of the busiest bridges in the world.","That depends entirely on the type of bridge. Three famous bridges under construction.

"If horsepower is calculated from torque (and RPM), then why do some engines have more horsepower than torque while some other engines have less horsepower than torque?","/u/HorsesForCourses asked: > Why do some engines have more horsepower than torque while others have less horsepower than torque? I'm not an expert, but I think it's to do with the way the engine is designed. Engineers have to choose between a few different things when designing an engine. They have to decide how big the engine is going to be, how much fuel it's going to use, how much power it's going to make, and how much weight it's going to have. If you want a big engine, you're going to have to make it heavier and use more fuel. You're also going to have to make it bigger. But if you want a light engine, you can make it smaller and use less fuel. You can also make it smaller. And if you want a powerful engine, you can make it bigger and use more fuel. But you can also make it bigger. But if you want a small engine, you can make it smaller and use less fuel. You can also make it smaller. So there's a tradeoff between how much power you want to make, how much fuel you want to use, and how big the engine is going to be.   a tradeoff between how much power you want to make, how much fuel you want to use, and how light the engine is going to be.

However, the amount of torque being produced will be different at different engine speeds. If an engine makes the most torque at a high RPM (i.e. a motorcycle engine,) the resulting peak horsepower calculation will be high. If the engine makes the most torque at a low RPM (i.e. a semi truck engine,) the peak horsepower will be much lower than the peak torque.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 12.55, 'recall': 32.97, 'fmeasure': 18.18}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.84, 'recall': 2.22, 'fmeasure': 1.22}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 8.37, 'recall': 21.98, 'fmeasure': 12.12}}"
Why do heaters vent air from the ceiling and not from the floor?,"It's a matter of efficiency. If you vent the air from the floor, it will just warm the floor and then go up to the ceiling. This is wasteful. If you vent it from the ceiling, the air is already warm, and it will go right back into the room. So it's more efficient to vent it from the ceiling.","I'm not an architect or civil engineer, but I have lived in many places and in my experience home ventilation systems are more related to the climate of the area that the building is in. For example, all the new constructions I saw in North Dakota had vents in the floor; whereas in Phoenix, where I currently live, most new homes have the vents in the ceiling. In North Dakota, the AC will almost never be used, however heating is used 8-9 months out of the year. Since hot air rises, you want the vents in the floor. In Phoenix, the heat is never used, but AC is running about 6-7 months of the year. Since cold air sinks, you want the vents in the ceiling. Also, as the other person said, the architecture also comes into play. I doubt you will ever see floor mounted vents in a basement or industrial building. This is because the foundation is going to be several feet of solid concrete. And good luck running ducting through that. When you look up in an industrial building, like a supermarket or office tower, you are not actually seeing the ceiling. There is many feet above the false ceiling you see that is used for ducting and wiring. In these applications, venting from the ceiling is a matter of practicality. You could conceivably run ducting down through the wall and vent at the bottom of the wall, but that would be an unnecessary cost and no sane building owner would pay for that.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 54.84, 'recall': 13.08, 'fmeasure': 21.12}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.39, 'recall': 3.86, 'fmeasure': 6.25}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.26, 'recall': 7.69, 'fmeasure': 12.42}}"
Why do flight attendants request that airplane windows be open for landing? What effect does it have on anything?,Its not alcohol but the dehydration. When you drink alcohol it dehydrates you. Dehydration can cause a headache. So drink plenty of water with your drink.,"There are several potential reasons: * It provides a way for emergency responders to see into the plane in the event of a crash. * It provides additional light (useful if there is heavy smoke) for the flight attendants to more easily ensure no one is left in a row during an evacuation. * It provides occupants of the plane a way to see outside and have more information to judge the conditions outside an exit door which may not have a large window. It allows you to see out the windows so you can follow what happens. If there is a crash you might see it outside the windows before the pilots have a chance to warn you, you might also see if you crash in the water or on land and take on your life jacket. When you have crashed you can see what the condition outside is before you evacuate. Is there fire, water or jet fuel on one of the sides so you should avoid opening the doors. Is the fire department already outside so you should let them handle the fire before you evacuate. When you evacuate what conditions can you expect outside the plane. And lastly the rescue workers can see though the windows if there are people or fire inside and direct their efforts accordingly. They might for instance have the tools to break though the hull of the aircraft and spray the inside with foam but this can be dangerous for the people on the ground and inside so you do not want to do this unless there is a fire and people trapped inside.

","To really understand the answer to that, you have to understand what went wrong in the first place. The city, decades ago, used cheaper lead piping for much of the city's water supply. That in and of itself *sounds* terrible but is actually not so bad: the lead doesn't corrode into the water easily, and the pipes were treated to prevent that. It's something that *could* be a problem if mishandled but is not necessarily a problem by itself. The mishandling came when the city council opted to get water from the local Flint River instead of being supplied by Lake Huron via Detroit like they were. The water in Flint River was significantly more acidic and had naturally occurring chemicals that corrode piping. Again, sounds terrible but as long as you don't have lead piping, it's not a big deal. Except, of course, Flint *does* use a lot of lead piping. This could have been avoided anyway if the water had been treated properly to prevent the corrosion, but it was not. That corrosion is what caused the huge spike in lead found in the water. The pipes lost their protective coating and began corroding, which dumped all the corroded lead directly into the water. *There is no fixing that*. Flint had long since switched back to getting their water through Detroit, but the damage was done. Once the pipes started corroding, you can't go back and fix it. It's like getting a scratch in the paint in your car and the metal starts rusting, and the rust starts seeping under undamaged paint and causing it to flake off, which causes more rust. Except your car is underground and you don't know where it is. Fixing the pipes means replacing the pipes, and for the most part, *no one knows where the pipes are*. They have a general area, sure, but the plans for exactly where the pipes were laid were made decades ago and a lot of them were lost or never updated with new construction. No one is sure which pipes are made of lead and need to be replaced and which aren't. That means tearing through roads, sidewalks, and property to dig up (and probably damaging) a lot of perfectly good piping to find and replace all the bad lead pipes that have to get fixed. [It's going to be expensive]( URL_1 ), [maybe exorbitantly expensive]( URL_0 ). Flint was never a rich town to begin with. That's what caused this crisis in the first place: the city council trying to save money on water. After the crisis, the people who could afford to leave have almost certainly all left, leaving mostly people who *can't* afford to leave. Think about what that means: they don't have enough money to leave the place where their drinking water is literally poisoning them. The city simply doesn't have the money to fix it. And it's not like their neighbor Detroit is doing well enough to give them money - and it wouldn't be a loan, Flint can't afford to pay back a loan anymore than they can afford to pay for it themselves. There is no quick or easy fix for it unfortunately. The incorrectly treated water created a corrosion problem in the pipes of the city, causing them all to leach lead into the water system. Without a top to bottom overhaul of the entire cities water lines, the problem can't be fixed. That will take approximately a decade, and will cost millions if not billions of dollars. The damage was already done when they let the corrosive water into the system. That stripped away protection preventing lead from leaching into the water from old piping systems. They did switch back to Detroit water almost as soon as the issue was noticed, but that doesn't replace the protective mineral layer around the pipes. To fix it ""tomorrow"" would be to spend a billion dollars pulling out and replacing literally every pipe within the city water system. You need to pay a team of engineers to redesign the pipes to modern standards, purchase the actual pipe, pay a crew to install it, and also pay homeowners for destroying their front/backyards. This project will take years. The only other alternative is to simply keep running water through the system to allow the mineral layer to build back up. Eventually the old pipes will be OK, and lead levels will go below EPA levels. This process will also take years. Unfortunately, Flint isn't exactly a booming industrial town as it was a few decades ago. Their electorate voted for a city administration that promised to cut costs no matter what, which included switching water supplies. Yes, this was a fantastically bad call, as they saved more money by not paying for engineering studies that would have said as much. They also ignored their city water engineers who said it was a bad call. Those officials are being punished in due course. While we'll all feel super bad for them, it's tough to justify kicking out a billion dollars on their water system instead of 50 new schools literally anywhere else.

I'm no expert but I always thought that they had little radar devices inside of the rounds that would explode into shrapnel when near an airplane. *I'm assuming you're talking about large calibre flak (such as the 8.8cm) and not lower calibre anti-aircraft guns that work the same as normal guns.* Flak shells in WW2 had 2 types of fuses, either a timed fuse or a barometric fuse. The timed fuse is pretty self explanatory and detonates when the timer expired. The barometric fuse on the other hand detonated when a certain (set) altitude was reached. Timed fuzes, mostly. They generally knew what altitude the planes they were shooting at were flying, and how long it took for their rounds to reach that altitude, so they set a timer. The Allies also had proximity fuzes. They were essentially tiny radars that would detonate the shell when it got close. Very important to the war effort, almost on par with the atomic bomb. The shells they are firing up at the planes have an adjustable fuse that can be set before firing to explode at different altitudes. The idea is to saturate the area around the planes with shrapnel and hope it hits the airmen, or something vital in the plane.

How do bladeless fans like those made by Dyson work?," We know that air is made of a bunch of tiny particles, and that those particles are moving at different speeds. As those particles move past each other, they create friction, which causes heat. When that heat is absorbed by the fan, it causes it to spin. So the question is: how does the fan create enough friction to spin the fan? The answer is that it creates a lot of friction. The fan has a lot of tiny blades that move really fast. The fan is also made of a special material that is really good at absorbing heat. So when the fan spins, it creates a lot of friction. That friction absorbs a lot of the heat that would normally be absorbed by the fan, and that makes the fan spin faster. So, in short, the fan works by creating a lot of friction. The fan creates a lot of friction by moving really fast, and by being made of a special material that is really good at absorbing heat.","They have blades, they're just in the base.

Why are radiators often located beneath window shelves?,"Radiators are often located beneath window shelves because it is more efficient to heat the air near the window, which is where the sunlight hits. The radiator is heated by the hot water flowing through it, and the hot air rises, so the radiator is usually placed where the warm air will rise and be able to mix with the cold air that is being heated by the radiator. This is the same principle as a convection oven.","you are almost right - it is usually the coldest spot in your room. But that also means, that this is the part of the room that is the hardest to heat. If you'd put the radiator at the other end of the room you'd have a very warm and cozy part of the room and the freezing part of the room right next to the windows. And to get the cold corner to a nice temperature you'd have to make the warm part of the room even warmer. Putting the radiator at the window leads to a more evenly distributed warmth in a room. There are many reasons why. As said already, it helps with the heat distribution of the room by creating a warm buffer near the window to help minimize heat loss. This pocket of warm air insulates the rest of the room from drafts coming from the outside.

will the imminent arrival of mass produced lab grown meat change the vegan perspective of meat eating.,"Junk food is a catch-all term for foods that are high in calories, sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.  ","This is such a common question over on the vegan subreddit they made it the first thing on their FAQ, and conducted a poll. The answer is that most vegans say they wouldn't eat it, as they're already used to and happy with their meatless diets. However, most *vegetarians* say they'd consider eating it, and both groups consider it a very positive step in reducing animal cruelty and are big proponents of it becoming cheap and viable as a meal option. As a rule, serious vegans don't eat food that was produced by animals, even if they ae (largely) unharmed - no milk or cheese, some don't wear wool, eggs are out. For them, animal exploitation is the line they draw. So how will that apply to lab meat? Hard to say. It does come from a cell line extracted from an animal, so some will be opposed to it. Others will consider a one-time, painless extraction to be a small price to pay for potentially tons of cruelty - free, death-free food. We'll have to see. Depends on the vegan. Some don't eat mean for moral reasons, some for health reasons, and some because their don't like it. You also have psychological factors. If you spent most of your life swearing how much you love your sprouts and you don't miss meat at all, you might feel the need to stick to your guns.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 47.37, 'recall': 3.69, 'fmeasure': 6.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.0, 'recall': 0.0, 'fmeasure': 0.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.32, 'recall': 2.05, 'fmeasure': 3.8}}"
"Why is it when the hot water knob in the shower is turned, even a fraction of an inch, does the temperature change so drastically?","Because water is a really good conductor of heat. When you turn the knob, the water molecules inside the pipes move around more, and they transfer their heat to the surrounding water. This is why you can feel the temperature change before the water actually changes.","Depends on how much cold water is running at the same time. If your shower doesn't push a lot of water than a fraction of an inch turn would correspond to a huge increase in hot water compared to cold water. If your shower pushes a lot of water than it wont be so much. Hot water should be 55-60 deg C (~140F) and cold water is about 10C (50F). So already you're using a lot of hot to counteract the cold, and for a comfy temperature it's probably a 50-50 or so mix, if you skew that to 60-40 or 70-30 the temperature goes up significantly.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 36.96, 'recall': 14.91, 'fmeasure': 21.25}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.44, 'recall': 1.77, 'fmeasure': 2.53}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.26, 'recall': 11.4, 'fmeasure': 16.25}}"
How effective was the Great Wall of China at keeping Mongolians out of China?,"The Great Wall was not a single wall. It was a series of walls that were constructed over time to keep out invaders. The earliest wall was constructed over 2,000 years ago, and it was not the Great Wall that we know today. The wall was constructed over a period of time, and it was not completed until the 14th century. The wall was not particularly effective at keeping out the Mongolians, who were able to breach the wall and invade China in the 13th century. The wall was not well-maintained, and it was not a particularly strong wall.   were able to use ladders to climb the wall, and they were able to use torches to burn through the gates. In addition, the Mongolians were able to use their superior numbers to overwhelm the Chinese army, and they were able to capture the Emperor and kill him.   were able to conquer China, and they established the Yuan Dynasty.   were able to rule China for over 100 years, and they were able to establish a culture that was distinct from the Chinese culture.   were able to bring their own religion, their own language, and their own customs to China, and they were able to establish a new culture that was distinct from the Chinese culture.  ","The wall served two main purposes: stopping raids and providing warning of attacks. It wasn't really meant to hold back a large invading army. It was pretty easy for nomads to raid Chinese farming villages in the north with just a few men. The wall was someone effective in deterring that because it's hard to destroy a wall with a very small force and it only takes a couple people on a wall to fight you off. When it came to large invasions, the wall's main purpose was to provide warning and maybe slow invaders. In fact, the wall has signal towers all along it so that a warning could be sent to wherever it needed to go. The wall was too big to man with a large, permanent force that could repel an invading army, but an invading army would still either have to spend time getting through the wall or around the wall. While they were doing that, the warning signal would be making its way to the capital and/or army. [This]( URL_0 ) thread from /r/askhistorians goes into some pretty good detail. I've been to the Wall and the story they give is that the smoke signals from the towers were the best defense, as mentioned earlier. Interestingly many locals will tell you that it was also built to deter evil spirits coming in from Mongolia as spirits naturally move upwards and so building a wall across the mountain tops would help to block that bad energy from entering China. The original wall wasn't built to keep the Mongolians out - they wouldn't be united until 1200AD by Ghengis Khan. It was built mainly around 200BC to keep the XiongNu out. The XiongNu were Asiatic Huns and consisted of small tribes of nomadic peoples. Not too much is known about them because they didn't leave much archaeological evidence and it was very early in China's history, so Chinese historical accounts weren't too reliable. The Great Wall is actually relatively close to Beijing - about 100km away (the part designed to protect Beijing and vicinity). From the Great Wall, you can see the skyscrapers of Beijing on an unpolluted day, and you could probably see signal fires on the Great Wall before modern light pollution and tall buildings got in the way. My totally uninformed opinion is that the Mongolians were know to be horse riding invaders. Horses would be difficult to get over the wall, so it would work pretty well at repelling them in large numbers. A ladder could get individuals over it, but if you're used to fighting on a horse you'll be at a disadvantage without your horse... You will probably get a better answer at /r/askhistorians. In fact, you should try searching there to see if it's been asked already.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 52.78, 'recall': 23.75, 'fmeasure': 32.76}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.02, 'recall': 5.85, 'fmeasure': 8.07}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.39, 'recall': 11.88, 'fmeasure': 16.38}}"
Is it feasible to build a wall like the US president is suggesting along the Mexican border?,"There are a lot of reasons why it would be difficult. First, it would be incredibly expensive. Second, it would be incredibly difficult to build it. Third, it would be incredibly difficult to keep it from being breached. Fourth, it would be incredibly difficult to keep people from climbing over it or digging under it. Fifth, it would be incredibly difficult to keep people from swimming around it. Sixth, it would be incredibly difficult to keep people from using drones to fly over it. Seventh, it would be incredibly difficult to keep people from using boats to sail around it.

This part would be straightforward. It would cost money and take time, but nothing about it is revolutionary. We even have some fences/walls up already that could be used as templates. 2) building walls and gates in 'unpopulated' areas. These include large farmland, sparse grazing areas, national park/forest land, and otherwise inaccessible areas. This would be the most expensive part of the construction effort. A wall that makes sense to build in a dense city will take a massive logistics effort and cost to build in the middle of nowhere. Concrete mixers, roads, power, camps for workers, would all need to be build along the construction zone. While possible, it would be a monumental effort. We have some current surveillance efforts in these areas, but it's mostly a 'when we can get to it' level of effort. 3) continued maintenance. If it does end up getting built, the wall will leave a large bill to future presidents and society for upkeep and guards. One of the main reasons the Great Wall of China was eventually abandoned wasn't the construction cost, but the cost of keeping thousands of troops in the middle of (literally) nowhere to defend the entire stretch. Supplies, transportation, entertainment would all need to be provided to guards on those stretches. As soon as society decides that the cost of maintenance is too expensive, the wall will almost immediately be compromised. Feasible, yes. Useful, hardly. & nbsp; * A large percentage of illegal immigrants exist due to overstaying their Visas. * Tunnels. * Unless you build it high enough, it can be flown over while still being under the radar. * A lot of illegal immigrants simply fly in on commercial flights. Some get caught, some don't. * The Gulf of Mexico exists. * The Pacific Ocean exists. & nbsp; A wall is more of a physical manifestation of Trump's foreign policy than actually being useful for keeping out illegal immigrants. It will create some jobs both short and long term...jobs that will likely be undertaken by immigrants, like most construction/maintenance/border patrol work. Feasible and possible, yes. We could even do it without manufacturing capacity or power equipment. For example, see China. For a more modern example, see Cold War Berlin. The real question is...will it actually accomplish anything other than costing a f*ton of money and making Trump feel a little more masculine? Spoiler alert: almost certainly not. It's entirely possible to build it; it's just a wall. The question is inherently about whether or not it's worth it, particularly considering most illegal immigrants will bypass it entirely by coming into the country through legal means and then simply not leaving. A concrete wall and a concrete road are almost the same thing, with a 90˚ rotation. There are thousands of miles of roads in the Southwest US. Making concrete panels is easy, drilling foundation holes and filling them with concrete is easy, pouring posts on the foundations is easy, slotting the panels in between the posts is easy. The US has many hundreds of miles of sound control wall beside the road that's been made with this process. It will take money, and time, and concrete, and machines. There are some rugged places where it will take some engineering, but that's a starter project for new civil engineering grads. The Rio Grande river has to pass through the wall, and it's very large in that area. This will not be an easy place to build a wall. Serious engineering is required, but not Hoover Dam engineering. The ""will it be worth the money"" question isn't an engineering question. Feasible? Sure. There are approximately 2000 miles of border and currently approximately 700 miles of ""wall"". What's another 1300 miles with enough resources to pay for and do the work? One thing that also needs to be considered is animal habitats and migrations. Animals don't pay attention to national borders so putting up a wall will restrict their movement a lot. I don't know if Trump will care (probably not given his actions regarding the EPA) but if the wall were to be built, figuring out how to make sure animals aren't badly affected would certainly add to the complexity. We aren't talking about a suspension bridge or a very tall tower or something difficult. We're talking about a wall. Walls are very easy to build. It does not need to be a specialized design. It just needs to be a wall that cannot be climbed. Like the peace barriers in Northern Ireland, or the West Bank wall in Israel, or the walls around prisons all around the world. It will be expensive, because it's a lot of wall. But it's not a complex technical structure. There was a great post earlier today by a structural engineer that estimated it would need 3x the concrete used to build the Hoover Dam, and 6x the steel required to build an aircraft carrier. Not to mention the labor and overhead costs to build something that is by and large in the middle of the dessert.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 41.98, 'recall': 10.11, 'fmeasure': 16.3}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.21, 'recall': 1.25, 'fmeasure': 2.02}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.47, 'recall': 6.14, 'fmeasure': 9.89}}"
Why aren't cars more fuel efficient?,"Fossil fuels are just a type of carbon-based fuel. There are other types of fuels that are just as efficient but made from different sources. For example, hydrogen can be produced from water, solar power, or nuclear power. Hydrogen fuel cells are a popular option for long-distance travel because they can be refueled quickly, but they're not yet widely available. There are also many biofuels, made from plants, algae, or other organisms. They are typically less efficient than fossil fuels, but they can be produced locally and are carbon neutral. The problem with biofuels is that they're not very efficient at producing energy, so you need a lot of land to produce enough fuel to power a car. There are also a lot of different types of biofuels and they're not all compatible with each other. So it's a bit of a challenge to develop a biofuel that works well and is compatible with existing infrastructure.","Things I learned during my Mechanical Engineering degree: * **Competing Factors**: Fuel efficiency isn't necessarily correlated with other positive attributes, like safety, cost, reliability, emissions, and engine characteristics. Designing a vehicle requires compromises between these factors. * **Emissions Standards**: Fuel emission standards need to be pretty universal. For example, Los Angeles is affected a lot more by high emissions than Denver, so car manufacturers abide by policies that lower emissions universally for the sake of L.A., even if it reduces fuel efficiency. It's an intertwining of politics and economics. For those who might be confused as to why fuel efficiency isn't always correlated to emissions: depending on several factors, an engine can emit different levels of various particulates, some of which are really damaging to the environment and public health.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 22.84, 'recall': 28.03, 'fmeasure': 25.17}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.86, 'recall': 2.29, 'fmeasure': 2.05}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 10.49, 'recall': 12.88, 'fmeasure': 11.56}}"
How do missiles like iron dome chase their target?,"Missiles are designed to fly in a curved path. They are also designed to have a high degree of maneuverability. The maneuverability allows the missile to change course to follow the target. It is not a ""missile chases its target"" type of thing. The missile is programmed to fly a curved path and then change direction.","Missiles have four common methods of tracking Active: Missile has an onboard radar and uses it to track the target after launch (more advanced aircraft missiles and surface to air missiles have these) Semi active: Missile has an onboard radar and is receiving information from the ground radar as it's signal is bouncing off the target Semi active ground guidance: missile and radar both track the target, ground station makes final decision on what and where the target it Passive: IR and TV missiles track heat and changes/differences therein to find the target However, that was all extra stuff lol. I think the Iron Dome uses proportional navigation. Like the previous comment, it triangulates where the ground is, where it is, and were the the target is going to be and makes adjustments every few seconds. Since missiles don't react to threats (how would it see them) this is an effective counter missile guidance method. Unlike in anime, sci fi, and action movies, missiles do not ""chase"" their targets. They use sensors and math to predict the path of their target, and go to the point where their path intercepts the target path. They are also generally designed that when they get to the intercept point and explode, that they do not have to make a direct hit.

How are we able to shift from reverse to drive in a car while slowly moving backwards without damaging the shifter/gearbox or without the axels locking up?," In reverse, the engine is turned around so that the transmission and differential are also turned around. This is done by a special gear called the ""reverse gear"". This gear is designed to allow the engine to turn the transmission and differential in the opposite direction. This allows the wheels to turn in the opposite direction. This is what allows the car to move backwards.","Synchromesh dog collars. It's a little part inside the transmission that resists you pushing the gears together when they are not aligned. The feedback lets you snap the gear into place without damage. In an automatic transmission, there's also a torque converter serving the role of the clutch in a regular transmission. TL;DR: Because it's engineered to work that way. Both the clutch disk (in a manual) and torque converter (auto) allow slippage between the engine shaft and the wheels as part of normal operation. The clutch is easiest to visualize, think of two flat plates pressed together, each with sandpaper on them. Whenever you are starting to move the engine plate is spinning but the one connected to the wheels is not. As they are pressed closer together (by letting up on the clutch pedal), the spinning one rubs against the other one until it is also spinning and now you are driving forward. When you are backing up and then going forward, the only difference is they are initially spinning in opposite directions but the friction will cause the disc to slow, stop, and then spin in the other direction. The torque converter serves a similar purpose int he automatic gearbox.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 56.92, 'recall': 17.87, 'fmeasure': 27.21}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.38, 'recall': 2.91, 'fmeasure': 4.44}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.85, 'recall': 10.63, 'fmeasure': 16.18}}"

What is the purpose of drywall? Why is it used rather than wood? Why does there have to be such a big space between walls?," Drywall is a building material used to construct walls and ceilings. It is made of layers of gypsum plaster sandwiched between layers of paper. It is used instead of wood because it is more fire resistant, soundproof, and can be easily cut and shaped. Drywall is used because it is a cheap, lightweight material that can be used to create smooth walls and ceilings. Wood is heavy and expensive. Drywall is also a good insulator, so it helps keep the house warm in winter and cool in summer. Drywall is also fireproof. It is made of gypsum, which is a type of rock that is not flammable. This is important in a house because fire can easily spread from one room to another. Drywall is also soundproof. It can block out noises from one room to another. This is important in a house because you want to be able to sleep in peace. Drywall is also very easy to cut and shape. This is important because you want to be able to add doors and windows to the house.","Drywall engineer here! (yes we exist) Many of the answers in the thread are correct, but one of the big reasons everyone is missing is the fire rating of drywall. Drywall is made of gypsum, a hydrated form of calcium sulfate. When the gypsum is exposed to heat, the crystalline water begins to calcine off. This reaction consumes a TON of energy, and prevents fire from spreading across the sheet for considerable time. You can aim a flamethrower at one side of a typical 1/2"" sheet of drywall, and the opposite side of the sheet won't rise above 220F for about 30 mins. Hopefully the fire department has arrived by then. Feel free to ask more questions, I find pleasure in explaining this kind of stuff! Edit-to kill some misconceptions, I work in capital projects engineering for a drywall manufacturer. ""Drywall engineer"" doesn't exist, and would be way too general of a field! Wood houses are built using wood skeletal frames, the ""bones"" of these houses are studs. They provide sufficient structural support to keep the building standing and intact for decades, even centuries. You dont need to build housed out of solid wood, as it would just be unnecessarily expensive. Drywall replaced [lath and plaster]( URL_0 ). lath are thin wood planks that would be nailed to the studs in ceilings and interior walls. They don't provide structural support, they just create a flat surface between the studs, which would then be plastered. This was a multistep process that took several days to complete a room. Drywall, on the other hand, prefabricates the walls, ready to install. Just nail the sheet to the wall and you're basically done. Experienced drywallers can do i ln a day what lath and plaster-ers could do in a week, while offering a comparable result. This dramatically cut down construction time, required less labor, and thus saved money, so it was widely adopted. drywall is cheap, versatile, easy to work with, consistent and fire resistant. The space between walls in the interior is used for sound proofing, and running services like electricity, plumbing, drainage and heating. All of the other comments are fine but I need to add that a major reason is it used more than wood is that drywall is extremely flame resistant compared to wood. I live in the UK. The majority of our houses are not made using drywall/frames. Mostly from a durability point of view and our climate being very damp also. We use concrete/mix foundations with brick construction for exterior and interior walls. Some new builds have drywall put in for minor separating walls but these don't get used without joists usually because of the weights involved in brick built houses. My understanding of American style drywall construction is the gaps between the sides are a form of insulation by trapping air in the space. It's also useful for hiding wiring/pipes etc and means it can be repaired easier without having to replace both sides. Wood isn't used for the walls from an expense point of view. They could use cheap fibre board but it's not durable. Everyone seems to be ignoring your other questions. Walls have a surprising amount of stuff in them. Ductwork, wiring, plumbing, and insulation. If you made walls thinner it can be difficult to run all of this stuff. Also if you used less wood inside the wall it would be more flexible and wobbly. Some walls are actually framed thicker to accommodate for larger pipes. The wall behind a toilet is typically framed with 2x6s rather than 2x4s because the main plumbing stack is very large. As a fellow engineer, your first line and my first line reminds me of a joke......how do you know if the person you are talking to is an engineer? Don't worry, they will tell you. Buildings began as solid wall construction using logs or stone to as the structure, and a bonding agent to fill the gaps and add structure. But solid walls require a lot of heavy material and they don't insulate temperature or sound well, and it takes a tremendous effort. Also, every house was constructed individually so logs were hand shaped on site, and stone was assembled based on the available materials. When the hollow wall came into practice, precut (milled) lumber could be used as the 'bones' of a home dramatically reducing the work time, weight, and variations due to materials. With just the bones in place, the walls needed to be covered. For a long time, small, rough thin boards were used (lathe) to cover the walls, then a layer of plaster was applied to make it smooth, attractive, and air tight. But cutting/buying thousands of boards, nailing them up, and artfully spreading plaster is time (and money) consuming. Using large, premade sheets to cover the walls would make installation easier and cheaper. When drywall offered all of these benefits, it became to predominant material. However, other materials have come & gone with trends.... real wood (knotty pine is in my house), manufactured (fake) wood paneling, etc. Thoguh I didn't mention it above, the advent of electricity, indoor plumbing, and insulation all contributed to the development of these materials & styles. Likewise the scale that was needed to serve the growing population. Dry is cheaper than wood by far. The space between the outside wall is used for insulation and vapour barrier. I find it interesting that we in the Nordic countries have pretty much the same tradition of building single family homes as in the US (and Canada?), but our friends farther down in Europe (Denmark and south) prefer stone. I guess it is mostly relying on tradition, sparsely populated countries with lots of forest had easy access to, and the tradition of using, lumber. Also, it wood might be better suited when the winters are long and cold. Out homes evolved from log houses with external wood panel and interior clay/paint to studded frame(?) with interior cladding with either lath+drywall or OSB+drywall or drywall+drywall. Single drywall sucks. Outer wall have room for 30cm insulation (one feet for the metrically challenged). To remove problems with condensation in the wall, a plastic foil is needed behind the drywall on the inside. Everyone else has answered about the drywall, but as for why is there such a big space between walls, that's so there's plenty of room to run hot/cold water, water drainage, electricity, cable, phone, AC ductwork, and finally leaving plenty of room for future additions/modifications. Drywall is far cheaper than wood and it is far easier to repair should it become damaged. As to the space between walls that is there for sound proofing, the running of pipes, insulation, the running of electricity, the running of cable, the running of phone lines, the running of internet. Additionally, wood moves. It expands, it contracts, it warps, it twists, it bends. Imagine that over a large flat surface. Plus, drywall is much easier to finish. Many people want nice smooth surfaces. The stud space is there for mechanicals, but mostly for a space in which to insulate. A higher r-value needs more space as it's the air pockets between fibers that creates the insulated value. You can't take an r-11 batt and just squish it down to fit a smaller void... it doesn't work like that. Here in the northern US, you are seeing more homes constructed with 2x6 and occasionally even 2x8 walls (over traditional 2x4 construction) in order to accommodate thicker insulation and higher r-values. Is drywall the same as plaster board? (The standard stuff our interior walls are made of in the uk.) old homes in the usa used board and batten construction. this was a thin wall made form 1x 12 boards with a thin strip to cover the gap between the boards. it is more expensive and flamable plus no insulation is provided other than the r value of the wood. edit: batten I just wanted to answer the thickness part. Making the wall thicker increases the strength of the wall and makes the wooden studs more effective thus reducing the amount of wood required. If the wooden studs were rotated to look like this: ""- - - -"" it would make the wall thinner, but the wall would be more tempted to bend from the weight above it. Since the studs are placed like this ""| | | |"" it makes the wall thicker but stronger. Try taking a plastic ruler, it's easy to bend the flat side, but won't bend in the other direction. Now stand the ruler up and push down on the top part. See how it bows out in the middle and bends? Now imagine making a wall with multiple rulers in the two setups mentioned, you'll see the latter one is stronger.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 74.86, 'recall': 8.95, 'fmeasure': 15.99}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.54, 'recall': 2.21, 'fmeasure': 3.94}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.11, 'recall': 4.68, 'fmeasure': 8.35}}"
Pipeline regulations,"in the United States. Pipelines are regulated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) which is a division of the U.S. Department of Transportation. PHMSA regulates the safety of pipelines and hazardous materials transported by pipelines. The regulations are spelled out in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Pipelines are subject to several regulations. First, pipelines must be designed and built to carry the material they are designed for. For example, a pipeline carrying crude oil must be built to withstand the pressure of the crude oil. Second, pipelines must be operated by trained personnel. Third, pipelines must have inspection and maintenance programs to ensure that they are safe. Fourth, pipelines must have emergency response plans to deal with spills and other emergencies. Fifth, pipelines must have leak detection systems to detect leaks. Sixth, pipelines must have spill response plans. Seventh, pipelines must have emergency response plans. Eighth, pipelines must have a risk management plan. Ninth, pipelines must have a compliance and ethics plan. Tenth, pipelines must have a safety management system. There are several other regulations that apply to pipelines. The regulations are complex and often vary depending on the type of pipeline.  ","Depends on the country and the regulator, which also depends on where the pipeline is going to, and whether it's onshore or subsea. Here in Australia, you're required to develop a Pipeline Management Plan (PMP) that covers all aspects of the pipeline, e.g.: - Route planning. - Soil erosion and subsidence. - Thermal effects. - Construction (material selection, welding methodology, installation, compression and transmission, integrity verification). - Maintenance (corrosion control, inspection, non-destructive testing). - And, at the end, decommissioning and environmental reconstruction. As for are they doing enough, well, in most cases yes. The majority of pipeline discharges are unrelated to the pipeline itself. Most common is people drive into them, or drag marine anchors over them, or they get dislodged or damaged during severe weathers. Hell, in Nigeria, the locals come in and cut holes in them to steal buckets of oil out of the pipeline, and in more cases than not it blows them the hell up. BP's Alaska pipeline spill was a direct result of cost-cutting. They scaled back on their maintenance program (especially pigging - where you run essentially a drone down the pipe and check corrosion and wall thickness), the pipe corroded and pissed crude oil out of the ground.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 28.43, 'recall': 27.45, 'fmeasure': 27.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.59, 'recall': 4.43, 'fmeasure': 4.51}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.21, 'recall': 13.73, 'fmeasure': 13.97}}"
How did the spaceships Challanger and Columbia fail?,"So far, the only thing we know for sure is that the Challenger and Columbia disintegrated. The only thing we can do now is speculate.  allenger disintegrated 73 seconds after launch, and the Columbia disintegrated 16 minutes into flight. We know that the Columbia was carrying a new type of heat shield, which may have been the cause. There are also reports of a leak in the Challenger's fuel tank, but this is not confirmed.  allenger had been in space for 100 days, and the Columbia had been in space for 16 years. The Columbia had been refurbished, and the Challenger was brand new. Both were launched at the same time, and both were carrying crew.  allenger was on its 10th mission, and the Columbia was on its 28th. Both missions were routine.  allenger was carrying a teacher and two other civilians, and the Columbia was carrying a crew of seven.  allenger was launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the Columbia was launched from Cape Canaveral.  allenger was launched on a Titan III rocket, and the Columbia was launched on a Columbia rocket.  ","For the Challenger disaster the right solid rocket booster had an o-ring that was not designed to fly in conditions as cold as they were that day. It could withstand down to 4 °C but ambient temperatures were -2.2 to -1.7 °C. Ultimately the failure of the o-ring destroyed the craft. For the Columbia disaster a piece of foam insulation broke off the external tank and struck the left wing of the shuttle. This meter-long piece of foam broke off when the craft was traveling at about 2,600 kph and likely caused a 15-25 cm hole in the wing. Upon reentry into the atmosphere this gap in the shielding allowed hot gasses to enter the wing and destroy the craft.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 23.66, 'recall': 34.65, 'fmeasure': 28.12}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.62, 'recall': 2.38, 'fmeasure': 1.93}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 12.9, 'recall': 18.9, 'fmeasure': 15.34}}"
What is the point of this USB adapter?,It's called a USB OTG (On The Go) adapter. It allows you to connect a USB device to your computer (or another USB device) and then connect to a USB device. It's really useful for things like connecting a smartphone to a computer or tablet. The smartphone can then be used as a keyboard or a mouse. It can also be used to transfer files between the two devices. The USB OTG adapter is also useful for things like connecting a USB headset to your computer so you can use it for voice chat. It can also be used to connect a USB printer to your computer so you can print documents. It's also useful for connecting a USB flash drive to your computer so you can transfer files. It's really useful for things like transferring photos from a camera to your computer or transferring files from your computer to a USB drive. The USB OTG adapter is also useful for things like connecting a USB keyboard to your computer so you can use it to type documents. It can also be used to connect a USB mouse to your computer so you can use it to click on things on your computer.  ,"Maybe if you have a USB that won't quite fit into the plug for one reason or another? I've had it happen where a cord is bulky at the connection and my USB area is crowded, I guess if you want to ensure a tight fit this might come in handy as a small extender.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 9.18, 'recall': 33.33, 'fmeasure': 14.39}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.46, 'recall': 5.36, 'fmeasure': 2.29}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 6.76, 'recall': 24.56, 'fmeasure': 10.61}}"

First, the contractor or plumber will go to the DPW and request a permit for the job. Next, you need to have your plan in order. A big job requires detailed plans including being up to code. This is the big problem with old houses. It can require lots of renovation to bring old buildings up to code. After you have your plans set up, someone from the DPW will meet you at the property and review the building and your plans. If approved, you do it. Basically, plumbing needs to be the same in any building, new or old. This requires tapping into the main water line, running pipe, branching it off to various rooms and fixtures, installing toilets, fixtures, etc. When you're finished, you get another inspection. The big difference between new and old plumbing is the lead issue. The word 'plumbing' comes from the Latin word for 'lead'. I forgot what the Latin word is... Anyway, current plumbing codes require no lead whatsoever. Old plumbing had lead in the pipes, the solder, and the fixtures. No good. We are currently in the process of renovating our 1865 farm house. The structure is made of limestone rocks held together with mortar. There was no insulation in the walls. It's much like building a whole new house... on the skeleton Sometimes for electric they will surface mount everything if the wall space is inaccessible or nonexistent. This means you would see all the pipe and boxes, similar to [this]( URL_0 ). They can surface mount plumbing and internet cable the same way. It's not pretty, but if you can't access the walls it's sometimes the only option. Typically- any truly old buildings would be covered by a type of preservation law. Depending on the country, there might be codes to which a house is renovated. For example- in America, private property trumps all, unless the deed includes an easement- meaning the legal documents for the property include rules about what changes can happen. Also in America, some concessions are made that allow historic buildings to not follow all modern codes, provided there is no effect on public safety. This is why house museums often are not ADA accessible, even though it typically is mandatory for public buildings. This allows the house to have small corridors and no ramps- as those additions would greatly alter the property. So long story short- When dealing with historic properties, it is always important to know what laws apply to the renovation. It is always expected that plumbing, wiring, etc. MUST be updated. Therefore a contractor can receive permission to move forward with these updates.then these updates occur as they would with any renovation, doing what must happen to assure safety and such, demo-ing as little as possible. But for updates that are not ""necessary"" - like heated bathroom floors for example, depending on where you are- often times the government will request/demand that these changes not be made to preserve the historic quality of the house.

How do transistors work and be the size of a atom?,"Because technology advances at an exponential rate. The rate of technological advancement is accelerating. That's because the rate of technological advancement is exponential. It's not that we're making more progress, it's that we're making more progress more quickly.","The operation of a vacuum tube is a lot like a Field Effect Transistor (FET), but the actual mechanism of operation is a bit different. And the construction is very different. Transistors are ""solid state""...there's no vacuum (or moving parts). So transistors are much more reliable and ""shrinkable"". One of the great things about transistors was that people figured out how to manufacture a bunch of them at the same time in a circuit configuration (an ""Integrated Circuit"", or IC). Then they figured out to make the whole circuit smaller, and smaller, and smaller. This is what enabled the microelectronics revolution over the last 50 years. Sometimes people describe transistors as little switches, but this is not quite accurate. They are actually little amplifiers, but we *use* them like little switches in digital electronics. (In analog electronics, we use them like little amplifiers, which is what they are.) In a FET, there are 3 connections. How much current passes between the Source and Drain connections is controlled by the voltage put on the Gate connection. (There's actually a 4th connection, but we can neglect it for this description.) So you can amplify a small signal by putting it on the Gate and letting it control a large current between the Source and Drain. In digital logic, you either put a very little voltage on the Gate, or a lot. So the SD current is either very little, or a lot. In this way, the transistor acts like a switch, except the switch isn't controlled by anything mechanical, it is controlled by the Gate voltage. The smallest transistor I've ever hear of is a [quantum dot]( URL_0 ), or perhaps a [single-electron transistor]( URL_1 ). These are still in their infancy, and I don't understand them enough to describe them. They don't really work like the ubiquitous FET that are in so many things today. In today's FETs, some of the materials are down to one atomic layer *thick*. But the whole transistor is still larger than an atom.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.19, 'recall': 5.48, 'fmeasure': 9.74}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.0, 'recall': 0.0, 'fmeasure': 0.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.58, 'recall': 3.17, 'fmeasure': 5.64}}"
"Why are cars designed so the fuel tank is easily accessible from the outside, but to refill the windshield washer fluid requires lifting the hood?"," Painful to refill the windshield washer fluid. Painful to refill the gas tank. So what is the difference? The difference is that you are not supposed to be refilling the windshield washer fluid in the middle of a drive. It is a maintenance task that you should perform at a time when you are stopped, and it is not a task that requires you to be in a hurry. In contrast, you are supposed to be in a hurry when you are refilling the gas tank, and the hood is a convenient place to put the gas pump.","Because you fill the tank regularly. Most people can go months without having to refill the washer fluid. It is topped off during oil changes and most people probably never have to fill it themselves. People need to refill their gas often multiple times a week. People need to refill their windshield wiper fluid yearly. Engineers want to protect your property however easy access to gas is a priority. To consolidate this dilemma many vehicles only allow access to the gas tank via an interior unlock latch. You need to refill the fuel tank a lot more often. The fuel tank is often located some distance away from the engine, so it wouldn't make sense for the opening to be inside the hood.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 39.8, 'recall': 31.45, 'fmeasure': 35.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.34, 'recall': 8.94, 'fmeasure': 10.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 22.45, 'recall': 17.74, 'fmeasure': 19.82}}"
How does a moon pool work (wet porch), I don’t know about the moon pool but a wet porch is a very simple system that allows the sun to warm the water in the pool. The water is pumped into the pool and then back into the system. The water is warmed by the sun and then cooled by the water flowing through the system. This is a very efficient way to heat water. You can also use solar panels to heat the water. This will work better in warm climates. In the winter you can use a heat pump to keep the water warm.,"Yes, air pressure would be the same as water pressure. The bends happens when you reduce pressure too quickly, which is why it is also called decompression sickness. As long as the diver didn't come out of the wet porch and then immediately reduce the pressure to 1 atmosphere, they would be fine.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 16.33, 'recall': 29.63, 'fmeasure': 21.05}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.06, 'recall': 3.77, 'fmeasure': 2.67}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 10.2, 'recall': 18.52, 'fmeasure': 13.16}}"
why do you need a GFCI receptacle in wet places when it provides the same function as a circuit breaker?,"A circuit breaker can only detect the short circuit at the point where it is located, and will only trip the circuit if that point is the only point on the circuit that is shorted. In a wet area, the water can travel to other parts of the circuit, and if it does, the circuit breaker will not trip. A GFCI will detect the short circuit in any part of the circuit, and will trip the circuit if there is a short. This is important because a short in a wet area can cause electrocution.","A circuit breaker trips when too much current is detected. Here ""too much"" is on the order of 15 *amps*. By the time the breaker trips it's far too late for the person being shocked. GCFI trips if the current imbalance exceeds a *much* lower value, around 0.006 amp. A circuit breaker only shuts off if excess current is drawn through it. In most cases a short circuit between the hot and neutral will cause excess current to flow causing the breaker to trip. If there is a short between the hot and ground, again it should cause the breaker to trip. However if there is a short between the hot and some other ground path outside of the circuit, it might not cause excess current to flow. This could still be incredibly dangerous because you can be seriously injured or killed from as little as 0.05A Most home circuits in the US are 15A. So as you can plainly see, the circuit breaker will do nothing to help in this case. The Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter on the other hand compares the current flowing through the hot to the current returning on the neutral. If the two are not the same, then some current must be leaking out of the circuit somewhere else and that is clearly a dangerous fault condition. A circuit breaker will trip on a fault current equal to the rated value in 10 or 15 minutes. An overload twice that would trip in a few seconds. A person will fry badly in that time. A GCFI trips in a few hundredths of a second. That's fast enough to prevent injury.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 71.58, 'recall': 24.37, 'fmeasure': 36.36}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 21.28, 'recall': 7.19, 'fmeasure': 10.75}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 41.05, 'recall': 13.98, 'fmeasure': 20.86}}"
