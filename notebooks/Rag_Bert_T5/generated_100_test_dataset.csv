why does stretching feel good?,"e, so that the phone knows that it is not dead. That's how you get a text message from a dead phone.

Stretching helps this, making your muscles go back to normal! After long periods of inactivity, your muscles, tendons, legements, etc., are at rest. When you stretch, your body releases these chemicals called marklar that, much like n-dolphins, help you feel better. Also, a lot of things that are good for you ""feel good."" It's like nature's motivation. Eating feels good, which is nature's way of motivating you to take in energy. Having sex feels good, which is nature's way of motivating you to reproduce. I think somewhere along the line in evolution, essential tasks/behaviors became intertwined with the activation of reward centers in your brain. So if in some bizarro universe licking your nipples was essential for your survival, that would feel good too, because everybody who hated licking nipples would've died off.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.08, 'recall': 6.41, 'fmeasure': 11.16}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.56, 'recall': 0.23, 'fmeasure': 0.4}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.23, 'recall': 4.35, 'fmeasure': 7.57}}"
Why blueprints are done on blue paper,"he other calls or messages that are not answered. That will be the same for every call, but this will be redirected to another phone or a different phone. For example, if you have a phone that isn't answering, it might be a different phone - or a different phone that is answering from the same phone. I've seen this happen with phones that aren't answering from a different phone, so I've seen it happen to me.","The drawings (before computers) were done on a special kind of paper that was then put into a tube filled with ammonia gas. The ammonia would react with the paper to generate the blueprint. The special paper used was tinted blue by the chemical which reacted with the ammonia and the lines creating the drawing became dark blue. Blueprints are actually [cyanotypes.]( URL_0 ) I work with them regularly at my job at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. There are two cool things about them. They will fade if let out in natural or artificial light, but will become brighter again when placed in darkness, and, for a time, they were used as a cheaper alternative to other photographic processes, so there is a lot of cool photography in shades of blue. At HSP we have a beautiful cyanotype scrapbook of a 1900s bohemian couple touring Europe on bikes. I know some artists still use the process as an aesthetic choice, also cause you can still make them yourself fairly easily. I know they were replaced by [Photostat copying]( URL_1 ).

What is the significance of prime numbers in encryption? Why are we trying to find bigger ones?,"ly sends the message to the device, and the phone has to send it to the device. The computer then downloads the message and sends the message to the device. This is a very simple process. You get a message from the device, and then the phone can send it to the carrier.  ","If you take one number, let's say five, and multiply it by itself some number of times, let's say three, you get an exponential expression, which we would write in this case as 5^3 = 125 which we say as five to the power of three is 125. If we made the three bigger, the result would get huge very fast. It's really easy for a computer to calculate an exponent though. On the other hand, what if we knew that 5 raised to some power is 78125, can we easily figure out what the missing number is? This is still very easy for computers to do using a function called the logarithm. Remember that when you divide two numbers, a/b, you may get a remainder. We call this remainder the modulo of base b (the denominator, or second number in the division). Sometimes it's just called 'the modulo', for short if it's understood what the base is. We will use base five. What is the modulo of 7^2? 7^2 is equal to 49, if we divide by five there is a remainder of 4. So the modulo is 4. This is still a very easy computation for a computer to do. But what if we know that 7 raised to some power modulo 5 is equal to 4; can we figure out what the mising number is? There's a limited number of answers you can get, so you know that there has to be more than one possible solution. It turns out that solving this problem (called the discrete logarithm problem) is very hard for computers to do. Any computer could handle the given problem easily, but only because the numbers used are really small, it becomes essentially impossible for sufficiently large numbers. So what does this have to do with prime numbers? Let's say you have some known number raised to the power of a variable modulo some known base, and you start plugging in values for the variable, 1,2,3 and so on you will eventually get to a point where the sequence of values starts repeating itself. Every number in the sequence will be between zero and one less than the base of the modulo, but you might not get *all* of these. It turns out that if the first constant is a prime number, you will get every possible value no matter what the base is. This is the mathematical property that public key encryption (the kind that relies on prime numbers) exploits. I mentioned before that crypto systems need to use really big prime numbers. A more honest statement, mathematically, would be that they rely on kinda large prime numbers. The size of the prime number depends on how much computing power it needs to be able to withstand. As computers in general get faster, we need to use larger prime numbers to remain secure. The largest prime numbers that we know are much, much, much, much bigger than the prime numbers we deal with in crypto. Knowing these numbers isn't particularly useful in and of itself. Mostly we're just interested in finding *more* prime numbers because there are still lots of things the best mathematicians can't figure out about them. Because there are just so many of them though, we tend to be interested in the biggest ones we can find (we've known for a few thousand years that there is not a biggest prime number). One interesting property of prime numbers is that the bigger you get, the further apart they become. This means that when a new biggest prime number is found, there's a good chance it will be a fair bit larger than the previous one. Mainly because we have no good method of prime factorization with computers, and the complexity of the problem scales exponentially in trying to find bigger primes. RSA for example mainly relies on multiplying two relatively large primes together. You could theoretically decrypt it if you could find the prime factorization of the very large number used to encrypt it. But that is task still to complex for the world's best supercomputers. Currently the biggest primes are found via mathematical tricks, such as the famous 2^n - 1, which will for quite a few values of n, spit out a prime number.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.49, 'recall': 4.22, 'fmeasure': 7.88}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.31, 'recall': 1.23, 'fmeasure': 2.29}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 50.94, 'recall': 3.68, 'fmeasure': 6.86}}"

What exactly does it mean for a system to be 8 bit/16 bit/32 bit/64 bit? Why is it in multiples of 8?,"t sends a message to the phone's phone's phone's phone's network, which then sends it a message to the phone's network. The phone is basically waiting for the message to arrive, because the phone isn't ready to receive the call.  ","A lot of replies in this thread say that it is because a bit is base two and 8/16/32/64 are powers of 2. This is NOT the correct reasoning. Firstly, each bit is a binary digit that is either 0 or 1 (think of a switch, it's either on or off). Each bit has 2 possibilities. A 1-bit system is obviously not too useful because of the two states it can represent, so we connect multiple 1-bit systems together. So for a 2-bit system, there are 2^2 = 4 representations. 3-bit systems have 2^3 = 8 representations, 2^4 = 16 representations, etc. You might have seen or heard that computers cannot handle numbers larger than about 2.1 billion. This is where the limitation of 32-bit systems come from (2^31 is about 2.1 billion. One of the bits is used to represent the positive/negative sign). There is nothing stopping you from building a 3-bit system, or a 23-bit system, or a 377-bit system (the point is none of these are powers of 2). In fact, this has been done before. There are modern video cards that have 192-bit memory channels which is not a power of 2. I don't know what the real reason is (perhaps someone who works in processor design can better answer this) but I am suspecting that this comes down to convenience and scalability from old to new software/hardware. System with weird bit sizes are usually designed to do a specific task. For example, digital signal processors (DSPs) have used 9 bits, 18 bits, 26 bits, 48 bits, etc. in the past. It indicates the size of a pointer(computers use this to address memory). 32 bit pointers can address up to 2^32 bytes(around 4 gigabytes) of memory and 64 bit pointers can address up to 2^64 bytes or 16.8 million terabytes. It is multiple of 8 because for almost all computers, 1 byte is the minimum addressable unit of memory and 1 byte equals 8 bit. It's multiples of 2, and it's because bits are 2-base. This means they are either 0 or 1. So when we have a number that is 8-bit it means it is a number represented by 8 bits. This can be converted to the regular number system -- decimal also known as 10 base -- by going from right to left along the 1s and 0s and adding. The bit on the right is 1 or 0. The next bit to the left is 2 or 0. The next bit to the left is 4 or 0. The next is 8 or 0, etc. For example, 0110 in binary is equal to 6, because the 1 spot is 0, the 2 spot is 1, the 4 spot is 1, and the 8 spot is 0. This means we have a 2 and a 4, so we add them to get 6. In this example we are dealing with a 4-bit number, because there are 4 bits. In an OS it generally means the size of an integer, and can affect things like the amount of memory that can be used. Interesting addition: 4 bits is a nibble, 8 bits is a byte. Sigh... Computer engineer here, all of the answers in this thread have thus far missed the mark. The simplest and most correct answer is that there is no technical definition of a microprocessor's ""bit width"". They're largely marketing terms that rest on a foundation defined entirely by the manufacturer. Consider for example the MIPS R4000 microprocessor used famously in the Nintendo 64. It's widely known as being one of the first ""64 bit"" microprocessors, and it does indeed have 64-bit instructions. However, most of these 64-bit instructions are implemented in microcode on top of 32-bit harder and involve the sequential execution of multiple 32-bit instructions. Despite its namesake, very few if any Nintendo 64 games used the R4000's 64-bit instructions because they were simply too slow. Consider next the Intel 8086, marketed as a 16-bit microprocessor. It is true that the 8086 has 16-bit general purpose registers and can perform only 16-bit arithmetic, but it uses a segmented address space which provides access to 20 bits worth of memory (1 megabyte). Intel introduced the MMX instruction set extensions with the P5 series of microprocessors. The MMX instructions included the ability to load and store 64-bit values in the MMX registers, perform boolean logic operations on 64-bit values, shift 64-bit values, perform vector arithmetic on packed values (two 32-bit values, four 16-bit values, or eight 8-bit values), but did not include the ability to perform scalar arithmetic on unpacked 64-bit values. Despite having some 64-bit capabilities, they were not marketed as 64-bit microprocessors. The most common reference point for a microprocessor's ""bit width"" is the width of the microprocessor's general purpose registers which is where most of the microprocessor's instructions are executed. Specialised registers such as those used for floating point arithmetic, vector arithmetic, and special functions are not considered, nor is the width of the external address and data busses. The Intel 8088 was an Intel 8086 with an 8-bit external data bus rather than a 16-bit external data bus yet it was still marketed as a 16-bit microprocessor with a 20-bit address space. It means how much memory can be addressed. The bigger the number the more memory. Since computer memory must be a power of two the measure is expressed as such.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 50.0, 'recall': 2.4, 'fmeasure': 4.58}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.67, 'recall': 0.31, 'fmeasure': 0.6}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 41.3, 'recall': 1.98, 'fmeasure': 3.78}}"
what is a director/maestro doing with his hands?," phone's phone that's most likely to be connected to the network, and the phone's network isn't really the one that's gonna call you, but the one that's going to call you. The phone's network is actually pretty good at detecting and detecting that it's connected to something - a phone that's actually connected to something.  ","In the most basic sense... you have a group of 40 people that all need to start playing their instruments at the same second. Without the director, they'd basically never know when to start, or the start of the song would ve extremely choppy as people are trying to catch up or figure out when to start. Unless someone yelled out ""ok start"" and then began playing. The director is that role. And then, the director keeps tempo and signals coming changes in music. Again, if he wasn't there, you wouldn't know how fast or slow to play. You'd need to just hope that someone is staying on beat and that you can follow them. The director centralizes that. He is leading. Not some random person who should be focused on playing their music. He is controlling tempo or beats per minute. He can also signal a crescendo, an increase of volume, or a decrescendo, a decrease in volume and how slow they should be. He can signal to slow down or pick up speed. Sometimes, he will help emphasize certain instrument or vocal parts. For example, he may wave his hands in time of a particular instrument's parts. The orchestra knows the music and if needed, they could play the whole piece without the maestro, but it is hard to keep a steady pace. The maestro controls how fast they go and keeps them unified during harder parts, such as a slowing down, picking up, growing louder, or growing softer. With the left (usually for right-hand dominant) he keeps time. Upward counts one. Down counts two, left three, right four. The larger the movement, the more volume he wants out of the band/choir. He may supplement with the right if he feels there needs to be emphasis on the degree of change in speed/volume. With the right, he queues in or gestures out the next group or helps adjust speed/volume/execution of the phrase or note.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.03, 'recall': 8.63, 'fmeasure': 14.54}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.61, 'recall': 0.3, 'fmeasure': 0.5}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.57, 'recall': 5.36, 'fmeasure': 9.02}}"
"What is the difference between a good lawyer and the ""best lawyers money can get you"" while defending you in a case?","all from the phone's operator. If it's on the internet, they can send a text message to the phone's operator. If it's on the internet, there's a delay. So if someone is on the internet, they'll be sending a text message back to the phone's operator.","To put it simply as thus: A good lawyer works within the law to get you the best result possible. They work with the system, and don't break the rules, and so are good all round. The best lawyer money can buy, however, is one who knows when, where, and how the rules can be bent. They know how far the rules can be bent, and which rules can be bent in which situation. And thus, they are able to get a much more favourable outcome that the good lawyer can provide, albeit at a high cost. In addition to this, the best laywers are very specialised in what they do. A top end laywer who defends you in a murder case, for example, may have spent their entire career studying the criminal laws for murder, and cases where the rules have been bent, both successfully and unsuccessfully, and what results came out of it. If you hired this lawyer then, to defend a libel case, or a common dispute, they wouldn't be as good as a different top end laywer who has studied these cases. Think of it like surgeons. Most surgeons are good all round, and they can deal with most types of surgery, with no issues. But for specific and technical surgeries, like organ transplantation, brain surgery, or reconstructive surgery, a regular surgeon is not going to cut it, and you need to hire a specialist to get the job done the best.

Why are weightlifters fat?,"er methods. But when the phone is dead, you're not supposed to be calling the numbers that you are supposed to call. It's a bit like a phone being a mobile phone. You've got to call your phone from the phone's ""phone number"" to call the phone (or any other phone network).  ","long-time ""Olympic-Style"" lifter here... (I lift primarily to be strong and stay in shape. I'm not ""competition strong"" nor am I ""super buff"" in the slightest, but I do lift heavy with the goal of increasing strength and muscle.) The way you get stronger and build muscle is by putting on mass. This means you have to eat at a caloric surplus everyday in order to fuel the growth, development, and healing of your muscles. If you do not eat enough, you cannot increase muscularity, and eventually cannot even maintain it. This is because muscles are insanely dense and require more 'food' to sustain. If you don't, and your body starts 'burning' calories, it will burn some readily available fat first, but then eventually begin breaking down excess muscle tissue because it 1) gives more fuel for your body, and 2) is harder to maintain, so it'll burn it off to get you back to an equilibrium based off of what you're eating. Since these competitors are trying to be as strong as possible, they do not balance their surpluses with diets, because dieting will cost them strength and physical muscle in the process. They eat big, lift big, get big. They don't want to lose any muscle. Ever. I can personally say that you will lose noticeable amount of your peak strength if you go on a diet in order to lower body fat and get ""ripped"". For me, I lost roughly 10-15% of my peak lifting after dieting and losing about 30lbs (from 182lbs at 24% BF to 153lbs at 13% BF). 10-15% for me is not much. But if those competitors did that, they would basically lose their ability to compete in Strongman comps. They would probably sacrifice up to a quarter of their lift numbers unless they used steroids in order to counteract the potential loss of muscle. 1. Not all of them are. 2. Cutting weight reduces strength, which is the entire point of competing in lifting. Most aren't, since Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting (I'm assuming you meant one of these) are weight class sports, so to get the most muscle and strength in your weight class you'll need to be low in bodyfat. However, there's usually a superheavy class which is something like 125kg+. For lifters in that category, there's no reason not to get fat (until it limits mobility) since it's much easier to gain muscle and avoid injury while on a calorie surplus. As the muscles get larger, a thick layer of subcutaneous fat forms over their [huge] muscles, making them look fat. Without the musculature, they would look like a person of average build. The reason for this is ~~to provide a large supply of ready-to-use energy that the muscle can grab whenever it needs.~~ to protect the muscles from physical damage, and help in hormone production. In addition to this, when they are actively lifting, their stomach pushes out because of the sheer amount of muscle there. Zyndrunas Savickas is a good example of that. He is around 160kg, but is around 18% body fat (average level). EDIT: Further clarification EDIT2: Major correction Different weightlifting goals=different body types. Some lift to be strong, some lift to sculpt the body, to highlight the muscles. You will never see a body-builder enter or win a ""Strong Man"" Competition. Totally different animal. Totally different goals. Body builders have to lift heavy weights but they are far from being as strong as someone training for a Strong Man competition. A typical body-builder will for example deadlift 300 to 400 lbs for reps whereas a Strong Man competitor will deadlift nearly double that for reps while training. Eddie Hall has the deadlift record for ""bar and straps only"" at 1025 lbs. Also, Strong Man competitors eat a lot of food, a whole lot of food, to fuel their bodies. Bodybuilders eat a lot as well but not nearly as much as a Strong Man competitor. Most weightlifters aren't fat. But basically eating a lot (more calories than you burn) helps you get stronger. A common method is a period of 'bulking', eating a lot to get stronger, and probably gain some fat as a result. Followed by a shorter period of 'cutting', eating fewer calories than you burn in order to lose the gained fat. Because you'll never be at your strongest when totally lean, most likely. These guys lift and eat like crazy to ensure their muscles are growing at a maximum, ensuring max strength. This requires a lot of calories, and even if you're eating super clean, you'll gain some fat. Essentially you saturate your body's caloric uptake so that you are your strongest, with some fluff being added as collateral damage. It depends on goals and what works best for you. Some bodybuilders bulk up during off-season and then cut for competition while others remain quite lean year-round and that's just figuring out what works best for you. It's easier to just bulk because your diet can be no as strict and you progress faster but you also have to cut more after that. Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting has weight classes so lifters that want to be competitive choose the best class for themselves. If you're taller/have a bigger frame you'd wanna go to a higher weight class so you can fill out your frame because a shorter lifter at the same weight can carry more muscle and outlift you. Like bodybuilders, some weightlifters and powerlifters cut for a competition or do water manipulation or whatever else they do to get in their weight class. Also if you look at lighter classes you can find some really jacked powerlifters or weightlifters. I've noticed that usually lighter lifters deadlift more than they squat and it's the opposite for heavy guys. All that thickness makes it harder to get down in the position for the deadlift but for the squat you start from the top and when you descend areas of your body push against each other and provide some support (same for bench but probably less). So that's something to consider how your weight affects how you lift.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.71, 'recall': 3.21, 'fmeasure': 6.09}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.73, 'recall': 0.66, 'fmeasure': 1.26}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 48.21, 'recall': 2.55, 'fmeasure': 4.84}}"

The important news is that humanity has sunk a lot of resources into giving themselves this response. -Entire species of dogs left effectively helpless, but for their capacity to appeal to human standards for oxytocin release. -Entire subreddits devoted to masturbating this oxytocin release. -Tuning competitive impulses to release *other* neurochemicals whenever we present an ""explanation"" that's really just a cursory view of biological artifacts, rather than any proper effort to deconstruct modern human experiences. The thing that's metaphysically happening is that humans want to connect with everything they can, and there are certain visual cues that make that easier. But we have gifs of buildings falling down, and all it takes is a little face doodle to get us to empathize with them. In the present environment, descriptions of neurotransmitters is just another way to release neurotransmitters, not any proper explanation of a thing. I can understand the reason we feel 'awww' for babies etc (instinct to take care of offspring) but why do we think fluffy animals are so cute? Humans aren't fluffy. Is this because we've come to associate them with pets as we grow up, and not so much a hardwired thought? First off, babies are annoying. They have to be as they need lots of reliable attention to get the care they need to survive. They tune their crying to match the natural resonant frequency of their parents ear canals. This means they also match random other people's ears too. This makes it very tempting to smash them with a large rock. Their parents won't because they are under the influence of oxytocin, but the other tribe members need the awww instinct to prevent random baby smashings. Baby animals trigger it too, because instincts aren't exactly smart. They only need to work well enough for people to survive. Question I have is why do I not feel this way towards anything? I have looked at pictures and videos of babies and animals and felt nothing while people around me did. It's a vestigial hunting instinct. Notice that it's almost always accompanied by a desire to squeeze the thing as hard as you can. Emotions are like memories from our evolutionary history. They direct our behavior without us learning them first, because they are part our genetic code. We respond to certain queues around youth, like a high eye size to head size ratio with a caring impulse. It helps our species survive by making us more likely to care for our young.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 64.41, 'recall': 5.65, 'fmeasure': 10.4}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.9, 'recall': 0.6, 'fmeasure': 1.1}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 40.68, 'recall': 3.57, 'fmeasure': 6.57}}"

Can we go below absolute zero? Yes - > how / No - > Why,"'t do anything. Basically, its not going to make a phone call, it's just running the app in memory. The phone is not going to get a call from the phone manufacturer, so the phone can't send a phone call to the phone manufacturer. It's waiting for the phone manufacturer to send a message to the phone.  ","You can't go below absolute zero because that's where there is no energy and you can't have negative energy. The colder something is, the harder it is to cool it even more, and the more energy it would take. If you tried to cool anything to or below absolute 0 (0 K), it would take an infinite amount of energy. Therefore, you can not cool something to below 0 K the way you would cool something to 1 K or to any other temperature. However, there are cases where a temperature of below 0 K is obtained when you run the maths, but these are actually hotter than an infinite temperature, and you cannot get to below 0 from 0 K by cooling even more. This is a bit harder to explain simply, but I'll try : imagine a bunch of balls on a hill : all the balls will naturally roll to the bottom of the hill. When they are all at the bottom, everything is at its lowest point in energy and nothing is moving, that is absolute 0. If you give a bit of energy to the balls, they start to move a bit higher up the hill. That's the balls ""heating up"". When you heat the balls up enough that they can get anywhere from the bottom to the top of the hill, and are actually distributed everywhere equally, that's an infinite temperature. If you somehow manage to give even more energy to force the balls to stay closer to the top of the hill than the bottom on average, that's when you get to a negative temperature. Hope that is simple enough for a 5 year old! It depends on how you define temperature. For most purposes, we simply define temperature on a macroscopic scale as the amount of heat energy in a system. With this definition, absolute zero is an absolute limit (that you can never actually reach). If you place an object at absolute zero next to an object at any other temperature, heat will always flow to the absolute zero object. However, it is possible to view temperature as involving the statistical likelihood that components of your system occupy different energy states. In this sense, a negative temperature becomes possible by fiddling with the entropy and energy involved in a system. But this isn't a 'negative temperature' that makes sense in the more common definition of the term above. I'm not sure there's any way to explain this second definition at an ELI5 level other than to point out that it exists and will never affect your fashion choices.

The CGI kids cartoons you see are relatively cheap to make because it's totally fine for things to look like shiny plastic spheres or play-dough blobs, it's fine for them to move in simple ways, and because they only make the characters and most of the environments once,and get to constantly re-use them. Doing CGI for a war sequence in Game of Thrones, where you're inventing totally new things for individual scenes and expecting them to look good incorporated into real-life footage, is a lot harder. A lot of CGI TV cartoons use toys or inanimate objects as main characters because that makes it even cheaper. You don't need to carefully animate good facial movements on talking cars and trains and you don't need Barbie and Ken's skin to look soft and natural. The first big all-CGI movie was Toy Story, and they chose toys for exactly this reason -- it was incredibly demanding to create realistic looking stuff, but if you made the characters toys, the fact that they looked like plastic or wood was actually an advantage! When you are good at something never do it for free. And render times are long, you need lots of high qualified people for these nice Hollywood cgi effects.

And, in some ways, it's a benefit in the legal field. That a corporation is a person means it can be sued, that it can own and have responsibility for property, that it can be taxed, etc... The controversies have less to do with the idea of corporations bring people than with the extention of particular legal rights to corporations, like free speech rights or religious rights, where there's less clearly a historical basis. > The basis for allowing corporations to assert protection under the U.S. Constitution is that they are organizations of people, and the people should not be deprived of their constitutional rights when they act collectively.

They think that local school boards should be making these curriculum decisions and the more that distant government entitles (particularly at the federal level) are involved, the less it will match local needs. B) Traditionalists - These people want to be able to help their kids learn, and they think this would be a lot easier if their kids were taught the same way they were.

This is the same reason you can't drive a car or a car in a car. The battery will just keep running and then the phone will start booting up. The battery will then stop when the phone's battery is full.  ","> How does national debt works? A country (in the form of its Finance Ministry/Treasury) will issue bonds and sell them on the open market. These bonds are obligations by the country to pay back the purchase price, plus interest, after a set number of years. Then after that time has passed, the holder will come to the Finance Ministry, hand in their bond, and get cash back. > And is it possible for a country to pay all of the debt back? Absolutely. It could cover all the outstanding bonds in the regular way and just not issue any new ones, or it could buy all of its bonds back early and cancel them. > And what are the usual interest rates? Depends very much on the country. From fractions of a percent to maybe up to 5% or more for very risky countries like Greece at the height of the Euro crisis. Very respected economies can even issue negative-yield bonds, like Germany did at some recent point I think - when the bond is handed back in, the holder gets less than the bond's original sales price. This is because people trust the German government more than they trust a bank where they would normally deposit their money. > And why do countries take up soo much debt? Sometimes for political reasons (they need to pay for something that they promised their voters). But in general, as long as the interest rate is lower than your economic growth rate, it makes sense to borrow money for investing in things like infrastructure that bring long-term economic benefit. Say a country borrows a hundred million euros today to build a new power station. It's a stable, rich country, so the bond yield (total interest rate) over ten years is 1%. In ten years it will have to pay out a hundred and one million euros, but its tax revenue over those ten years has increased more than 1% - as a share of its budget, 101 million euros today is less than 100 million euros ten years ago. Plus the power station has been powering new homes and factories all this time, which is a great benefit! Generally, if your bond yields are lower than your economic growth, then you can just keep rolling the debt over - borrowing money again to pay off the recently expired bonds. That's how countries maintain debts for very long periods. Because of the economic growth, the burden of the debt actually decreases over time, and it's worth keeping it rolled over. **This, incidentally, is why the enormous US national debt is not too scary.**","{'rouge1': {'precision': 52.24, 'recall': 7.94, 'fmeasure': 13.78}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.06, 'recall': 0.91, 'fmeasure': 1.58}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.34, 'recall': 4.76, 'fmeasure': 8.27}}"

This is to better facilitate passing on your genes. 2. When you ""finish,"" you don't want to keep pumping because your penis acts as plunger and pushes everything out. It's designed that way to push out other's semen but not your own. That's why your body gets hit with chemicals to instantly shut the thrusting down.

","Okay so some of the dirt and grime on your hands etc will dissolve in water (like sweat and salt), and some may be washed of just from the force of the water (like actual soil). However some stuff like bacteria can stick to your hands, and things like oil won't dissolve in water. Soap contains a ""surfactant"". What a surfactant molecule has, is one end that ""likes"" water (hydrophilic end) and this will dissolve in water; and another end that ""hates"" water (it likes oil instead, this is hydrophobic). The surfactant molecules can stick to your oil dirt, and help to take them into the water by forming layers around them. They can arrange themselves so that there is a shell of the molecules where on the inside it's all ""water hate"" and the outside is all ""water love"". These layers can form bubble like structures called ""micelles"". Soap ""dissolves"" into water and then creates little ""bubbles"" around the dirt/grease and is then left behind in the water as you remove your hands. Well your question is asking several things. As you wash your butt with your raw bar of soap (I know you don't use a wash cloth you animal) the outer layers of soap disolve into the water and fats that are on your skin, and the water rinses it off. Each time you use your bar, layers come off of it. It may seem like a lie since hairs stick to it - but it happens. The rate of stuff deposited on your bar is less than what is rinsed off - generally. Also, your bar of soap is a great emulsifier. This means that it disolves organic solvents (fat, oil, petrol) as well as polar solvents (water, some alcohols etc). One side of each soap molecule likes fat, and the other likes water. In chemistry there is a phrase ""like likes like"" meaning that similar molecules will dissolve in similar molecules. Soap just happens to have ends that act like each of the extremes of chemical solutions, so its all good. Soap is made by reacting a strong base (OH-) with fat molecules. Its a relatively easy process developed by pioneers and their ancestors long ago. In short: lye + fat + perfume + mixing = soap. This means as you wet your body and the soap, the soap molecules have a chance to strip away all the fat and organic material from your skin, as well as become absorbed into the rushing rinsing water. Your skin is resilient and alive and connected to each other so it doesn't get taken away (although given a high concentration it would definitely dissolve too) but all the crud on top of you does. In our world, most things are separated into polar and non-polar molecules, and soap dissolves them both. Rinse off the dissolved solution of soap+crud and you have ""clean"" skin. Cleaning your skin with soap also kills beneficial bacteria. Tis a symptom of ""cleanliness"" I suppose.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 38.24, 'recall': 5.18, 'fmeasure': 9.12}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.49, 'recall': 0.2, 'fmeasure': 0.35}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.88, 'recall': 4.18, 'fmeasure': 7.37}}"

If you try to visit Netflix, they should treat your network traffic the same way they'd treat it if you want to visit Google or Reddit. In other words, they are not allowed to, for example, have a policy that ""when you visit Netflix, we'll slow down your connection, because we have an in-house video streaming service that we want you to use instead"". Under net neutrality rules, they are required to treat all of your traffic as equal. The reason this is a big deal is that: - it prevents the ISP from upselling you different plans (you're currently on the Google plan. We can see you'd like to stream music from Spotify as well. Would you like to be upgraded to our Streaming+ service? It'll only be an additional $20/month"". - it helps competition. If ISP's were allowed to discriminate against specific sites, then they could, for example, run their own streaming service, and then slow down your bandwidth when visiting competing services and suddenly Netflix would be in trouble. Or Microsoft could enter a partnership with your ISP whereby your ISP would give Bing priority over Google's search engine. Any time you try to use Google, they could slow it down a bit, and when you use Bing they might give that traffic priority. Something like that could easily be used by big sites to prevent competition. Say you wanted to start up a new social network to be the new Facebook. Unfortunately, Facebook has *a lot* of money, and they might just go out to the big ISP's and say ""here's a bag of money. Please give our site priority over this new upstart"".

","Why would it result in inflation? Inflation would only occur if you increased the total money supply too rapidly compared to the total value of goods and services available in the country. If you just redistribute some of it (presumably you transfer the money from other government programs) then there shouldn't be inflation. The two main causes of inflation aside from printing new money are from increased demand outpacing production or from increased costs of production. I don't think providing people a GBI would cause such an increased demand for goods and services that the demand would outpace production. At least I've never seen any studies or numbers that indicate that. There's also no reason GBI would increase production costs. Increasing minimum wage might, but that's because the wages are paid out by businesses. Edit: Of course it depends on the amount, but I'm assuming something reasonable like $5k - $20k. If you give such a high GBI that people quit their jobs en masse or the government has to print money or cancel important programs to pay for it you'll have inflation and other issues.

Daytime was 10 hours with an hour of twilight on either side and nighttime was 12 hours. Nighttime was 12 hours based on 36 stars called ""decans"" that the Egyptians used to keep track of time based on when they rose in the sky. 18 decans would be visible at any given time of the year, but 3 were assigned to each side of twilight, so there 12 leftover for nighttime hours. The 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute comes from the ancient Babylonians who liked to split things in base 60. They had a thing for the number 360 because they thought that's how many days there were in year. They also like 60 because, like 12, it can easily be divided into several other whole numbers (2, 3, 4, 6). The 7-day week came up independently in a few ancient societies. It's unclear why exactly, but most likely because it's 1/4 of the lunar cycle. It just so happens that about 52 weeks fit in a year. People didn't start keeping track of years in their current form until significantly later on. The first person to start counting years from Jesus' birth was a Scythian monk named Dionysius Exiguus in 525 CE (and his system didn't become widespread until sometime later). Before that most people would count the number of years of the current king or other relevant ruler. So it would be something like the 10th year in the reign of King Virgo911. In Rome they would also sometimes count the number of years from the founding of the city. Most cultures around the world did this (counting years from a significant event or based on the ascension of a ruler or dynasty) and, in fact, that's what the current calendar does (counts years from a significant event, i.e. the birth of Jesus). We do it in base 10 because we're simply counting years from a reference point. Edit: Since this is picking up some steam, more fun facts. The Romans used an 8 day week during the Republic. They switched over to a 7 day week during the Empire (and officially adopted it in 321 CE). The Mayans had two different length weeks. One of 13 days where the days were just numbered and one of 20 days where the days were named. I'm not really sure how that works in practice. The Jews had a 7 day week because of the creation story taking place over 7 days. It's unclear where 7 came from. The French tried to implement decimal time shortly after the French Revolution, but it never caught on. In decimal time there are 10 hours in a day, 100 minutes in an hour, and 100 seconds in a minute. I just want to emphasize that some of these divisions are physical; that is, that's just how they are. The length of the day is fixed -- it's how long it takes for the Sun to move *all* the way around the Earth. At noon on day 1, the Sun is at its highest point. At noon on day 2, the Sun is again at its highest point. The length of the day is the time between these two. How we measure it is another matter. Notice that I didn't say that it's the time that it takes for the Earth to spin around its axis. That's because it actually takes less than a day to do that. It's just that, by the time it has spun around, it's also moved a bit in its orbit, so the point that was directly facing the Sun is now a little bit behind. Also, since the Earth's orbit is elliptical, the length of the day we use is really more of an average. The other physical quantity we use today is the solar year. That's how long it takes for the Earth to go all the way around the Sun. The year is actually *not* exactly 365 days but a bit longer, which is why we add a day every four years or so (the rule for leap years is that we add one day whenever the year is a multiple of 4, unless it's a multiple of 100, in which case we add it only if it's a multiple of 400). Nobody thought, hm, let's make the year 365 days. 365 (and a bit) is just how long it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun. The 7-day week is just something that stuck with us from ancient cultures. The ancient Israelites, for example, used a 7-day week, in which the 7th day was the day of rest. In the Abrahamic traditions, that 7-day week was kept, though Christians and Muslims both changed the position of the day of rest within that week. Other cultures had different weeks. The Mayans, for example, had a 13-day week and a 20-day month, making a 260-day ritual year (that obviously didn't line up with the solar year; they used a different system for that). It just so happened that the 7-day week is the one we use today, thanks in large part to the spread of Christianity, and the fact that there are 52 weeks in a year (plus a day, or two in leap years) is just coincidental. Another physical quantity we use, but a lot less often, is the lunar month. This is how long it takes for the Moon to make its way around the Earth, kinda. Just like with the length of the day, the actual measure is how long it takes between new moon and new moon, when the relative position of the Sun, Earth, and Moon are the same. This is some quantity between 29 and 30 days. Many cultures use it, including the Jews, the Muslims, and the Chinese; the phases of the moon are a fairly reliable way to mark time. Have you ever seen those moon calendars that tell you the phase of the moon on a given day? These are completely unnecessary in lunar calendars -- you always know the phase of the moon because it's the same every month! (The word ""month"" is even derived from ""Moon"" in English!) At some point, the Christians moved to a solar calendar, and they got rid of the lunar months. The thing we call a month now is kind of arbitrary. The fact is that there are a few days less than 12 turns of the Moon around the Earth in one turn of the Earth around the Sun, so they split the solar year into 12 non-lunar months like we have today, each one with 30 or 31 days (I don't know why they made February have fewer), and they no longer line up with the Moon. But the cultures that still use the lunar calendar have to work out ways to deal with the difference. The Muslims simply don't. Their year doesn't line up with the solar year at all and they're OK with that. The Jews, on the other hand, insert a leap *month* 7 years out of every 19, and there are a few other months that get an added day in some cases, mostly in order to make various holidays not fall on various days of the week (the 21st day of the 7th month, Hoshana Rabah, isn't allowed to fall on Saturday, for example). The main impetus here is to make sure that the 1st (Biblical) month is actually in the spring (note that long, long ago, Jews switched to a calendar that begins on the 7th month, which begins in the fall), so a month is added if the 12th month ends too early. In addition to this, I should mention that the division sexagesimal (meaning 60) division of minutes and seconds isn't *actually* from the Babylonians. Before decimals were invented by [John Napier]( URL_0 ) in the late 1500's/early 1600's, people actually measured everything in fractions of 60. This included degrees of a circle and parts of the hour. So a time might be 4 hours and a bit. How much was a bit? 26 60ths and a bit. The first 60th subdivision was tiny so it was called a minute subdivision, and the second subdivision was called... well, they ran out of fucks to give so it was just the second subdivision. So the time could be 4 hours, 26 minute subdivisions of an hour, and 5 second subdivisions of an hour. Of course, you could also have third subdivisions of things and fourth subdivisions and so on, but there wasn't much reason to use them once decimals caught on. On the other hand, hours kept their subdivisions because they were in common use by regular people, and degrees kept theirs because they were used in navigational star charts and such. The only number I haven't explained here is the 24 hours in a day, but I think other people already have so I'll leave it at that! 364/5 is defined by orbital mechanics. The rest is courtesy of the Sumerian-Babylonian astronomers and mathematicians. Their commoners had rituals centered around the 7-day week but at the same time the mathematicians used a base-twelve arithmetic, creating favour for 5*12=60 minutes per hour. Whereas the roots for ""decade"", ""century"" and ""millennium"" all come from Latin, and Romans used baseless mathematics but favoured multiples of ten. ""Century"" for them basically meant ""a hundred dudes"", such as a unit of hundred Legionnaires led by a Centurion. Another fun, somewhat related fact for you. I was told that if you take a look at deck of cards, then that represents a year as well. 4 suites - 4 seasons 52 cards - 52 weeks. 24 and 60 are more easily divided into smaller amounts. With 10, you can divide by 5 and 2 but that's it. We don't count anything by 52. It's just approx. How many weeks are in a year. Somewhat random comment: The calendar should be 13 months of 28 days each (364 days). Leap year should simply add a free day between December and January that isn't in a month. Just a free day for everyone. But no, 31, 28/9, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 is way easier and much more logical. A lot of people have great historical information, but are missing why some of these cultures used non-base 10 systems. ""They liked a different base"" is insufficient. 24 and 60 are both [highly composite numbers]( URL_0 ) which is a number that has more divisors than any other number smaller than it. 24, for example, has 8 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24), more than any lower number, such as 20, which only has 6 divisors (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20). The advantage of HCM's is their usability is better for general use due to their divisibility. You can divide an hour in half, or quarters, or fifths... in fact, you can divide it into up equal parts 12 different ways (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60). The Imperial Number system also uses a large amount of HCM's. Using the Imperial System to build a shelf with equal sections is much easier than building a shelf in the metric system with equal sections. Some one once challenged me on this by trying to go to base 10 ""What if the shelf is 10 feet, that doesn't divide evenly into 3 parts!""... it does, 120 inches is a HCM! Solid top explanation. Sixty is divisible by 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30. You divide an hour into 60 smaller, more 'minute' equal time periods (minutes), and then do it a second time into 60 (seconds). The Babylonians used a base 60 system, so to them that was a very natural number, like 10 to us. Once you define a week as having 7 days, which has been considered a special number for a very long time, 52 is just how many weeks are in a solar year, so that number isn't really an invention. Days to years is pretty obvious. Days to weeks, and weeks to years makes sense because it's an easy to subdivide portions of the year so that they divide nicely with both the solar (year) and lunar (monthly) calendars. Seconds, minutes, and hours are all a function of Babylonian and Sumerian timekeepers, who liked base 12 and base 60 number systems. For whatever reason, we never really tried to move on from that until the French revolution, when Metrification started, and when they tried to include a concept of metric time. It failed miserably, although the rest of the unit system *did* end up working. Technically, the Second isn't even based on astronomical observations and movements anymore. Officially, the SI second is now 9,192,631,770 transitions of a cesium atom, which pretty closely approximates 1/31.5M of the time between vernal points ^(known on Earth as the First Point of Aries.... which is actually in Pisces currently). Additionally, the current time of day (TAI) is measured by the number of those seconds or fractions thereof, averaged across ~400 atomic clocks, since some semi-arbitrary point in time that we call January 1st, 1977. We apply a number of leap seconds to that (currently 37) to get UTC time, then we can apply a time-zone correction, and that's how we know the time and date today, technically speaking. While seemingly pedantic, this method actually is critically important to a variety of things. For instance, computers and machinery use it to coordinate events and in some cases motion control across systems. In radio communications, it can be used to synchronize the transmissions of multiple transmitters to allow for proper operation (both cell phones and LMRs make use of this in some situations). Typically it's either determined through a GPS receiver, a local high precision clock, NTP, or PTP, or a combination of those.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 51.67, 'recall': 1.28, 'fmeasure': 2.49}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.39, 'recall': 0.08, 'fmeasure': 0.16}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 48.33, 'recall': 1.2, 'fmeasure': 2.33}}"

","It likely uses the same 4GB over and over. The 'random' in its name means that it supports 'random access' as opposed to 'sequential access'. Random access really means something like 'arbitrary access': you can access individual bytes of RAM quickly even if they're stored far apart, as opposed to a spinning hard disk, which can read bytes stored together closely very fast, but takes a longer time to access a byte that's further a away. edit: A good analogy is kind of like having papers around on your desk as opposed to filed away in drawers. If you need something on your desk, you can kind of just go straight to it. But if it's filed away, you need to take out the file and go through it until you find the paper you were looking for. RAM (random access memory) is so named because it is (nearly) just as fast to access one chip as another. As such, as far as I'm aware at least, no OS will prioritize any specific memory locations- an application asks for a block of memory, and the OS reserves whatever it stumbles across that is free first. RAM stands for Random Access Memory, meaning that any individual chunk in memory could be accessed at any time. So that 4 GB could be located within those 16 GB, and it doesn't have to be in a continuous chunk. However, since RAM Chips are slower (but much much cheaper) then the memory caches and registers built directly into your CPU, larger continuous chunks of memory are copied into caches, then smaller chunks are copied into registers. After a certain amount of time, the modified chunks of data are copied back into the caches then back into RAM. This process is fairly slow, and if the computer needs to refer to a piece of data located outside the cache, it will have to copy all the data it has modified back to RAM, then reload the cache. Fast operating systems will do their best to make sure that data used by specific programs are generally located fairly close together, so that it will reduce the number of cache misses. So your RAM will generally be fairly spread out with fairly dense clusters of continuous memory being used by a single program.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 53.85, 'recall': 8.95, 'fmeasure': 15.35}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.69, 'recall': 0.77, 'fmeasure': 1.32}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.31, 'recall': 5.37, 'fmeasure': 9.21}}"

","The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to United States President Barack Obama for his ""extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples"". The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on October 9, 2009, citing Obama's promotion of nuclear nonproliferation and a ""new climate"" in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world. It's a complicated matter but Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Price in 2009 because the committee said that him and his administration did a lot to reach out to the Muslim world and his work with nuclear nonproliferation (not producing as many nuclear weapons) Needless to say, this did have mixed reactions. After the Bush administration, which pursued a very unilateral policy, it was thought that Obama's foreign policy would emphasize international cooperation and less militarism. It was awarded ""for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples"". The Nobel Institute recently admitted that the award didn't really have the effect they had hoped for. Officially he won it for the reasons others have listed. Unofficially it was a FU to George W Bush. President Obama had only been sworn into office about a week before nominations were closed so he had no time to do anything to promote peace. Maybe it was a few weeks. I forget when the nominations were actually closed, but it was a relatively short time. If Hillary Clinton had won the presidency in 2008 they would have given it to her. The committee that awards the prize is appointed by the Norwegian government so there is naturally some political motivation involved.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 32.43, 'recall': 8.73, 'fmeasure': 13.75}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.37, 'recall': 0.36, 'fmeasure': 0.58}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.32, 'recall': 6.55, 'fmeasure': 10.32}}"

When music is recorded, it is normally recorded as multiple tracks. These tracks are then mixed down to the final recording you hear on the media you buy. 'Remastering' means that you take those master tracks and remix them to create a different final mix. In the modern day, remastering is also sometimes used to refer to taking source material and digitally re-processing the sound. For example, if you've got a recording from the 30s it's unlikely you'll have useable master tapes to reproduce the song as above. So instead you take what recordings you do have and send them through digital filters to remove artifacts and change the overall sound of the recording.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.21, 'recall': 8.88, 'fmeasure': 14.74}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.5, 'recall': 0.51, 'fmeasure': 0.85}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.63, 'recall': 6.09, 'fmeasure': 10.11}}"

This text gradually became what is now called the Old Testament of The Bible. The oldest parts of the Bible date from that time, but new parts continued to be added. This people eventually came to be known as the Jews. Among the holy texts was the idea that one day, a special savior would come along--the anointed one, the messiah, the christ. Every once in awhile, some Jewish guy would claim to be that person. This particularly happened when the Jews were in a bad situation. About 2000 years ago, at the time that the Roman Empire conquered Jewish lands, it was an especially bad time, and there were multiple men who claimed to be the messiah. Jesus was one of them. Some Jews thought he was the messiah, most did not. Eventually, the group who thought he was the messiah broke off from Judaism and formed its own religion, Christianity. They used Jewish holy books, which they now called the Old Testament--texts pre-dating the arrival of the messiah. They also created new holy books, which they called the New Testament, which they see as superseding the Old Testament laws. The Jews continued along with their own religion and own texts. Jews don't believe in proselytizing, so Judaism stayed a small religion primarily composed of the descendants of Jews from generation to generation. Jews continue to believe that one day a messiah will come, but that belief is only a very minor part of what Judaism is, so it's not something most Jews talk about or spend many prayers on. Christianity believes in proselytizing, plus eventually gained the adherence of the leaders of the Roman Empire, resulting in Christianity growing tremendously. Jews continue to use the Old Testament as their holy books, but of course don't call it the Old Testament, because that's a Christian designation. Plus the Jewish Old Testament contains slightly different texts than the Christian Old Testament does. And different Christian denominations have selected somewhat different books for their Old Testament, anyway. Like, one book, the Book of Esther, is part of the Old Testament for some Christian denominations, and not others, for example. And for Jews, the most important of the holy books is the Torah--Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. Those are part of the Christian holy books, but not as centrally important as they are to Judaism. Jesus was a Jew. The first half of the Christian Bible, the Old Testament, is pretty much the same as the Jewish ~~Torah~~ Tanakh. Judaism predates Christianity by many years (thousands). Jesus was, in fact, Jewish. The Jewish holy book is referred to by Christians as the Old Testament. Christians believe the New Testament, which is basically the gospels of the life of Jesus, takes precedent over the Old Testament. Christians believe that Jesus was the long-promised Messiah. Jews believe he was just another false prophet.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 39.71, 'recall': 5.26, 'fmeasure': 9.29}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.49, 'recall': 0.2, 'fmeasure': 0.35}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.94, 'recall': 3.7, 'fmeasure': 6.54}}"

So, if it's a phone that's supposed to be dead, it will probably call the number that it's supposed to be, but the phone won't answer it.  ","because it's kind of hard to have 300 people that don't know jack about putting a parachute on try to do it with the plane falling out of the air. and it's pretty lethal to jump out of an airliner going 500mph, even if you're a professional skydiver. and if the pilot was in control enough to slow the plane down to under 100mph, when it's safe to jump out....he might as well just guide it in for a landing. Because they'd be completely useless in any real emergency. The vast majority of accidents take place during takeoff and landing, at heights too low for parachutes to work (and happening too fast for anyone to even put on a parachute in the first place). For an accident at a higher altitude, parachutes will still be useless for anything catastrophic involving sudden cabin depressurization, because you'll pass out if you leave your seat (since you'll have to take off your oxygen mask). The only time a parachute might be useful is a situation where you have enough time to get everyone in the plane to put them on and exit the plane, and for a couple of hundred people (including children, infants, the elderly, and the infirm), none of whom have ever parachuted before, that's probably going to take a couple of hours, minimum. There's no situation I can think of that both takes a couple of hours, and is also safer to parachute out when you have no idea what you're doing with a parachute. Passengers are much safer staying in the plane as it attempts a controlled landing. And that's all ignoring the cost of carrying around all of that extra weight. Ticket prices would probably double, and almost no one would fly. It would be heavy, meaning added fuel consumption/expense for every single flight. It would be expensive to implement and expensive/time consuming for maintenance. It would take up a lot of space on the airplane. Passengers are not trained in their use nor could reliably be trained for various emergency circumstances in a short period of time. Commercial airlines fly too fast and too high for practical use of parachutes. Most accidents happen during takeoff and landing, when parachutes are useless. **TL;DR:** Impractical and expensive. Very unlikely to make any difference. This has been on TIL. Most accidents occur during takeoff and landing, where parachutes are useless. Most accidents happen during take iff and landing.

Piece of information #1: The current amount bid on the lot in question. Piece of information #2: The next highest bid increment. If you want the item, you have to offer that second number. When someone does, that becomes the new #1 piece of information, with the next increment being called. Styles vary from place to place, but the stereotype auction chant includes a lot of 'filler', which is really just there to make it feel like something is happening, when really the auctioneer is just trying to keep dead air from happening while waiting for someone to make up their mind and raise their card. Some try to make this filler more useful, like dropping information about the item, reminding people if remote bidders are still in or out, and things like that, but really it's just to keep awkward silences from forming. I assume here that we're speaking of the [auction chant]( URL_0 ), yes? Individual auctioneers develop their own style and patter, but it's still immediately recognizable as auction chant. Yes, the reason they speak that way does have to do with ""urgency,"" but it's *not* just about artificially creating an atmosphere that the auctioneer hopes will encourage people to bid. There are far more practical things going on. The auction chant is all about delivering just two pieces of information, distinctly, as quickly as possible: the current bid, and the next bid. All the rest is basically filler. It's okay that it's almost impossible to understand the filler as long as the *numbers* are distinct. Why do things that way? Because it's the best way to move as many lots as possible, as quickly as possible. This is particularly important in commercial auctions (e.g., livestock, cars), where there is often a truly *staggering* amount of goods, both in volume and value. Also, in many cases, simply getting all of the buyers and sellers together in one place can be a real trick. For things like livestock and other commodities, simply getting everyone together in one time, at one place, so that transactions can be completed on the spot, is a *huge* logistical undertaking. Every day a buyer/seller spends at the auction is a day they're *not* spending on whatever business brought them there in the first place. If everybody can only afford to be in town for a day or two, the auctioneer had best be able to move *everybody's* inventory in that day or two. Further, the auction chant has kind of become a thing in its own right. It's how people *expect* auctions to be conducted, even if it's only a single-item, (e.g., public sale of a house with no contents, etc.). The people have come out to an auction, and darn it, they wanna hear the auctioneer do his thing. So tradition has a lot to do with it, particularly in smaller auctions. Of course, none of that applies to auctioneers at *very* high end houses like Cristie's, Sotheby's, etc. Those guys seem to make a point, as a matter of class/style/whatever, to hardly speak at all. As they don't really have to: there are only a few items up at any given time, and they're of sufficient cost and/or uniqueness that the items themselves generate all the interest/urgency needed. Also, that godawful, plebian yelling is just *so* unsophisticated. What is this, a fish market? /s I worked as an auctioneer as well as went to auctioneer school. It is about creating excitement and in retail auction it can have a significant effect on how much you get for an item. As an example of showmanship making a difference, I have done auctions where you are required to sell everything from an estate (often times because there is in fighting between heirs). So nearing the end of the auction you have crap like a box of stuff that was under the kitchen sink. You can't get anyone to pay a dollar, keeping asking for it is going to kill the mood. You pair it with a few more boxes of crap and ask for a dollar. The crown is dead, you are loosing them. I take a dollar bill out of my pocket, throw it in the box and now you will get a chuckle and the very same pile of boxes will bring five bucks. More importantly you have won back the crowd. That is increases what you get on subsequent boxes. It seems to be confined to certain types of auctions and places. Here in the UK, for example, you'll hear something akin to the sort of thing I assume you're talking about (continuous, near-incomprehensible gabbling) at, say, some cattle auctions - but go to the average general or fine arts auction, and you'll get something very different; much clearer, with the auctioneer often working the room with comments, observations and even jokes to get the best price (of which the auction house, naturally, takes its not-insignificant cut; good selling = more profit). I can see why you might want to keep talking without saying much when, basically, you're selling the same item over and over again (""Oh look, it's another bullock!""), and need to fill time; outside of that, though, personally, I can't help feeling that the US-style incomprehensible auction drawl is often basically a ""traditional"" affectation that serves little to no purpose _per se_. I once saw an auctioneer who couldn't talk fast enough so after every increment he'd go grluuuuuuh (he'd roll his tongue on the 'l'). I'm guessing because an auction is a fairly fast-paced event so they need to be quick and not linger on bids for too long. And it keeps the excitement alive. As many have said, it's about adding urgency, avoiding silences, and generally keeping people engaged and therefore more likely to bid. But the auctioneer-speak has also become somewhat of an art form in and of itself. My granddad used to run a dairy farm, but even after retiring he'd sometimes take me to bull auctions to watch the auctions and listen to the various auctioneers. A lot of people would go for the same reason; it was almost like going to an auctioneering competition as much as it was going to an auction.

When they're thrown around haphazardly, that's liquid water. When they're stacked together neatly, that's solid ice. The thing is, these shoeboxes are vibrating. The warmer the temperature, the stronger the vibration. If the temperature is too high, that nice orderly stack of shoeboxes gets shaken apart into a disordered pile - it melts into a liquid. Now mix in some salt - throw a bunch of golf balls into your pile of shoeboxes. Now when you try to stack them together, there are golf balls getting in the way and causing the boxes to slide around. It's much harder for them to stack up neatly, and even a tiny bit of vibration is enough to collapse the stack. In order words, mixing salt into the water makes it much harder for the water molecules to line up into solid form.

The scientific consensus on GM crops is more solid than on climate change. So far, no one has answered the question, so I'll try to play advocate for the anti-GMO people: - Being genetically modified, some people are afraid that consumption of GMO crops will have as yet unknown health impacts or cause allergic reactions. - Farms will be even more at the mercy of big corporations, if they are forced to buy seed with copyrighted DNA from Monsanto etc in order to stay competitive. - Reduction of diversity: There is a fear that crop diversity will be further reduced by the introduction of GMOs, opening up the risk of widespread crop failures if a new disease comes along. - ""Normal"" farms operating next to GMO farms might get sued for using copyrighted DNA because the GMO plants have spread to their farmland. - Making crops more resistant to pesticide/insecticide through genetic manipulation could lead to farmers spraying more of these poisons on the crop, which isn't all that great for consumers or the the ground water. So, these are the main arguments stated by the opponents. Did I miss any? I myself am not anti-GMO, but I felt this thread was a bit one-sided with everyone circle-jerking about how everyone with half a brain HAS to be pro-GMO So, the short answer is that, from the perspective of the fearful, a GMO is a novel product and should be treated as such. With traditional foods, there's a long and extensive history where we've evaluated them for their nutritional benefits and costs, but with foods that are genetically engineered, there can be a large enough change between the base food and the GMO that we can't safely assume they have the same benefits and costs as their base organisms. But, quite frankly, those GMO foods are potentially dangerous enough that they triggered those reactions in some tremendously smart people well before the general populace was exposed to them. They have been more rigorously studied for short an long term side effects than any other foodstuffs available to our populations. To the best damned ability for us to figure it, the ones allowed for human consumption are completely safe. And, quite frankly, the anti-GMOers have a(n accidental) point. The foods we eat deserve a much more rigorous study than they've received. Without multi-generational double blind studies, there's no way to completely rule on how safe any given food is for humans. And those studies have never, and never can be, done. Whether or not the GMO food itself is safe or not isn't really the issue for me. One of the biggest concerns I have is (let's take corn for example) that these crops have been engineered to withstand the haphazard application of more and more toxic pesticides. Also Bt corn which produces it's own toxins to kill certain insects. Problem is that we are seeing these insects developing resistance just a short time in and also having possible adverse effects on non-harmful insects. Bottom line, don't worry about whether or not the food itself is going to hurt you. Worry about the side effects from the development of these crops and monoculture in general. Sorry it's late, I'm tired and rushed through this. Here is a short list of reasons why people are against GE crops, followed by an explanation of why they are not legitimate. All of them are “manufactured” – they are the end result of concerted efforts to discredit biotechnology. Organic farmers have a financial incentive to convince consumers that ""GMOs"" are bad. • Patents: Seeds have been patentable since the 1930s. Many non-GE crops are patented – odds are you have grown patented strains in your garden. • Monoculture: Most non-GE crops are grown in monoculture, because higher yield can be obtained. • Diversity: All seed developers cross GE traits into multiple strains of crops. GE crops have the same amount of diversity as their parent strains. • Corporatism: The seed market, by all accounts, is highly competitive overall. A few giants (DuPont, Monsanto, Syngenta) have cornered the market on certain crops (corn, soy, cotton, sugarbeet, canola), but there are dozens upon dozens of seed companies operating in the US and Canada to choose from. Also, these companies all sell organic seeds as well – so labelling/banning GE crops doesn’t actually help anyone avoid products from big corporations. • Unnatural traits: Essentially every crop has been modified to the point where it is “unnatural” – food crops are further, genetically, from their pre-historic relatives than Shih Tzus are from coyotes. • Hurting small farms: The argument that genetic engineering hurts small farmers doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Farmers are not obliged to purchase GE crops. Small co-ops still dominate the North American market, and farmers in developing countries report great success with products such as Bt cotton.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.38, 'recall': 4.28, 'fmeasure': 7.95}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.38, 'recall': 0.71, 'fmeasure': 1.33}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 43.08, 'recall': 3.33, 'fmeasure': 6.18}}"

I'm pro-GMO, but these are some of the arguments I often encounter. 1) It's not natural. Basically,a general belief that humans shouldn't meddle with things that are part of nature, and that nature is simply better than anything we can accomplish. 2) It's new. Basically, the general belief that because it's relatively new, we can't have studies it's effects over many decades, because they didn't exist yet. 3) Association with the agro-industrial complex. Basically, GMO's are often part of the big agro industry, with pesticide use and heavy cultivation of fields. 4) Bad science. Though the scientific consensus in favor of GMO's is strong, there are contrary studies, of varying quality and thoroughness. Think the Seralini affair and all that. Quite simply, they aren't, so the people *claiming* they're bad for you are either lying or misinformed and spreading misinformation and fear-mongering. Eating GMO foods does not cause ill effects. The food DNA doesn't recombine with your own any more than non-engineered food. In fact, GMO foods can often be *better* for you than non-GMO foods, such as the nutrition added to golden rice using genetic technology. There is nothing fundamental to genetic modification that makes food dangerous. It's important to understand that humans have been genetically modifying plants and animals for thousands of years - practically all food that humans eat are genetically modified. The difference is that genetic modification used to be carried out through selective breeding (a slow and indirect process) whereas we can now carry out genetic modification that is faster and targeted by directly modifying the genetic information of plants (or animals). But the result is pretty much the same as the genetic modification that humans have been carrying out for thousands of years, it's just more powerful. That's not to say that there are absolutely no risks with GMO. It is of course completely possible to modify an organism to make it harmful, just as it is possible to modify an organism to make it beneficial. There are also some environmental and socio-economic concerns that some people have with GMO. But none of these problems are necessarily intrinsic to genetic modification.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.51, 'recall': 10.28, 'fmeasure': 16.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.53, 'recall': 0.77, 'fmeasure': 1.27}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.74, 'recall': 5.91, 'fmeasure': 9.68}}"

The way they're used can vary depending on the person using them. Usually they'll either be used interchangeably, or 'psychopath' will be used to mean an especially severe or violent sociopath. There are *some* professionals who use them to mean different things; Robert Hare, a criminal psychology expert, uses 'sociopath' to refer to a condition you develop as a result of abuse, neglect, growing up in an extremely harsh and uncaring environment (eg being a child soldier or slave), and 'psychopath' to refer to a condition with similar symptoms that is more concrete and innate. But even he admits this is just a convenient way to talk about things in his writing on criminal psychology (where he's an expert) and not necessarily a hard neurological truth. The medical concept is called Antisocial Personality Disorder. Antisocial, note, does not mean introverted or shy or lonely, that's usually called being *a*social. Antisocial means more 'against society.' Antisocial Personality Disorder/'sociopathy' is defined by an inability to conceive of other people as actual people, extremely muted social emotion, exaggerated and uncontrolled nonsocial emotion (eg something that would make a normal person mildly irritated will make them seethe with rage), and usually attributes of narcissism (""everything other people say and do is secretly about me, if anything bad happens to me it was other people being jealous and malicious because nothing is ever my fault""). These are all great answers, but I would like to underscore the first point in the top comment: These are not official or clinical terms in the field of psychiatry. A person can't be ""diagnosed"" as a psychopath. Rather, these are social labels that people use to define abstract concepts of complex personalities. Naturally, that means that they overlap a lot. A lot of people have mentioned Antisocial Personality Disorder as mirroring cultural ideas of sociopathy, but I haven't seen anyone mention Conduct Disorder. CD is probably the closest clinical relative of psychopathy, like APD is to sociopathy. It's your basic toddlers-drowning-kittens type of thing, and only presents from a very young age. Like most personality disorders, this is also not something that can be easily handled by medication. I would *heavily* hesitate (Edit: flat out refuse) to relate general psychosis (ie. schizophrenia) to psychopathy, since the two definitions just don't overlap enough. Doing so only increases stigma on an already vulnerable group, who are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Just my input as someone who has worked with these populations. My shrink told me the following once: A sociopath thinks what he's doing is right, even though it's considered generally wrong by society. A psychopath knows its wrong but doesn't care or doesn't think there really IS a right or wrong in the world. A psychopath thinks of people as furniture to be moved out of the way on any whim, which leaves them prone to climbing the corporate ladder, which is why so much of our commercial society is fucked up. The distinctions between 'sociopathy' and 'psychopathy' has been widely debated in the field of Psychology due to the very issue surrounding whether 'sociopathy' is an officially diagnosable term. Psychopathy is firstly recognized as the neurological imbalance and lesions within the amygdala, the part of the brain that controls fear and judgment. With that in mind, those diagnosed with psychopathy primarily lack general empathetic abilities; the ability to understand and comprehend hurt, grief, love, and affection, as well as the desire to experience thrill-seeking emotions, often to 'compensate' for the lack of other 'basic' emotions that they lack. Psychopaths are often greatly misunderstood due to media accounts of serial killers, manipulators, liars. Whilst they most certainly have the ability to deceive and manipulate, only a very small fraction of diagnosed psychopaths are dangerous. Generally speaking, psychopaths may live their lives without causing pain or harm to others, although can be masters of manipulation due to their lack of empathy, guilt, or fear. Bankers are currently statistically rated to have the most psychopaths in its profession; as well as thrill-seeking tendencies, money, achievements, status, ego, and power are often viewed as a desire for those with such traits. They are able to reach goals through the lack of hesitation and perceived fear. Now, onto Sociopathy. Again, is it an officially diagnosed term? Or is it a pseudo-scientific, watered-down variation of the term, 'psychopathy'? The current DSM categorizes psychopathy as a variation of an antisocial personality disorder prevalent to biological factors. 'Sociopaths' are often vaguely described as similar in traits, although its root causes are based on environmental factors (such as levels of childhood trauma/abuse/grief, etc) in which cause, could also then be contributed to such disorders as 'post traumatic stress disorder', which also causes the same perceived traits as 'sociopaths'. In which case, psychopathy is more clearly definable in terms of the DSM, as a form of an antisocial personality disorder, whereas Sociopathy is often confused with a byproduct of past environmental trauma. Whilst there is a rather clear difference between the both disorders, with a rather similar outcome, I believe there needs to be more extensive theorized studies in order to strengthen the legitimacy of the term, 'sociopath'. Hope this helps. Although Psychopathy and Sociopathy are often used interchangeably Psychopathy is not regarded as the same as anti social personality disorder in psychpathological/forensic/psych literature. ASPD shows a pretty common pathway from ADHD to Conduct Disorder to Substance Abuse to ASPD. It also seems to have a much bigger nurture component than Psychopathy. Take a super impulsive, poorly self regulating kid put him in a terrible home life and your likely to get ASDP in the adult. Psychopathy on the other hand seems less determind by nurture. Psychopath born in a bad environment = jail, Psychopath born in a nurturing environment =CEO. The main difference between the two are what's known as low prosocial traits: callousness, lacking empathy (although not the theory of mind kind which can be impaired in autism), lacking remorse. ASPD folk can often report feelings of guilt or shame. Interestingly although the DSM doesn't recognise Psychopathy in adults as seperate from ASPD the most recent edition DSMV does aknowledge a subtype of conduct disorder in teens (the usual precursor to an adult ASPD diagnosis) which is characterised by low prosocial traits. So they're kind of aknowledging the difference. The short version from my psych professor years ago: A psychopath doesn't know right from wrong. A sociopath knows, but doesn't care. While not medical terms, psychopath and sociopath are used differently: Sociopath is generally someone who is particularly uncaring toward others. Often a master manipulator who only views other people as tools to get what they want. Experiences extreme feelings and emotions, but acts on them in antisocial ways, often violently. Psychopaths are people who genuinely are incapable or have extreme difficulty feeling. Like a sociopath, they have no problem using other people to get what they want, but unlike a sociopath, they have only a cerebral understanding of human emotions, and do not actually feel them. A perfect example of the contrast is Tony Soprano (sociopath played by the late and great James Gandolfini) vs Valerie (psychopath played by Beau Garrett) from Season 6 Episode 12 of ""House"". Edit: more clarity on my examples. Also, Dexter (psychopath played by Michael C Hall) would be another and slightly less obscure example. A sociopath is somebody with anti-social personality disorder. This personality disorder involves a complete lack of empathy - the ability to understand other people's feelings. Sometimes murderers are sociopaths, but definitely not all murderers, and not all sociopaths are murderers. Psychopathy is less clearly diagnostically defined, but generally it means someone who is not in touch with reality. A psychotic break is an event where a person does not understand the reality around them, this might include delusions or hallucinations. Someone who is psychotic might sometimes understand reality and sometimes not. Edit: since people are whining, yes, I am aware I defined psychotic not psychopath because *there is no clinical definition of psychopath*. You can't be diagnosed as a psychopath. I alluded to this in the first sentence of my second paragraph. Source: psychology post-grad student I have been waiting for this forever! I've studied this inside and out for about a year. They both are covered under a diagnosis of AntiSocial Personality Disorder, but they definitely have some differences (although, like other users have noted, people sometimes use them interchangably, which is not correct). Criteria for an ASPD diagnosis can be found [here]( URL_0 ). A note: regarding the nature versus nurture debate, psychopaths are generally considered to be formed by 'nature' and sociopaths are considered to be formed by 'nurture'. Psychopaths. I've met one, been abused by her, and escaped. Not fun. Psychopaths are completely remorseless. They view other people as rungs on a ladder to climb in order to gain whatever they want- money, power, etc. They will pretend to be affectionate with you while you are useful and discard you when you become a liability. They don't give a shit how they hurt you- and if they hurt you, they are aware of it. They are the ice to the sociopath's fire. They can mimic emotions and love with extreme accuracy, making them nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. They don't feel nervousness or anxiety- they are unflappable. Due to their lack of conscience and their view of other people as tools, they are extremely manipulative. Speaking from personal experience, they can make you believe that left is right. They tend to have an extreme sense of self- preservation (some will say otherwise, but the psychopath will not risk their neck). In terms of serial killers, psychopaths tend to be the organized killers. Sociopaths, on the other hand, *tend* to be made through circumstances that cause them to become this way. They're very reckless, and tend to be adrenaline junkies. They're the type of person that other people view as unhinged. Their negative emotions tend to be cranked up to ten, so pissing a sociopath off is an extremely dumb thing to do. Unlike psychopaths, they have the capability of having a conscience, but it's a pretty small one. Correct me please if I got anything wrong! A great book I read called the ""Sociopath Next Door"" details stories of some sociopaths. One that stood out to me is the sociopath driving to an important work meeting then realizes he forgot to feed his dog and his dog will likely die. The pure calculations the sociopath creates to justify his actions of not stopping this meeting or even contacting a friend (Sociopaths dont have true friends) to help sent chills down my spine. My friend was married to a sociopath. She found his Chrome history of gay hookup sites and confronted him with it. His response? I only got married and had kids to put a picture on my desk at work. All successful people have families. By no way do I work in this field of psychology or anything. I always thought a sociopath was a individual who did violent things from years of abuse neglect Things of a physical nature from society groom that person into violent. A psychopath was a individual who would do violent and obscene things that are rooted from not being able to grasp ""normal"" concepts of things like moral, love, (emotional response) because their perception is on a completely different means of compression. Lotta smart folks on this thread. I have a question: is it possible to simply grow out of a severe personality disorder?

why can't anyone/ thing go faster than the speed of light?,"esn't know how to send a message, but it's trying to send a message. You've got a cell phone that has an internal battery. You've got a phone that's connected to a computer, and it's telling you to open it. After that, your phone sends a message and the phone does nothing.  ","Technically, there's nothing that prevents anything from going *faster* than the speed of light, you're just not able to go *exactly* the speed of light, unless you have no mass. (There are hypothesized particles, called *tachyons*, that travel faster than light. They've never been observed and may not/probably don't exist, but they're not against the rules, as far as we can tell.) The reason why you can't go *exactly* the sped of light is all due to relativity. We know that light has a constant speed in a vacuum (called *c*). We know that because we've observed it, it's just a built-in fact of the Universe. So, think about how speed works in classical Newtonian mechanics: If I'm traveling at 50 MPH toward you and you're traveling at 50 MPH toward me, we each see the other going 100 MPH. But what if, while I'm traveling toward you at 50 MPH and I shine a light at you? Do you see the light I shine at (speed of light)+50 MPH? Nope, you still see it at *c*. This has been shown in countless experiments throughout history, and in fact things that we use every day like GPS depend on this property. For the speed of light to be constant for all observers even when they're moving relative to each other, means that things have to ""squish"" along their axis of movement (called ""length contraction""). This is separate from the feeling you get of being pushed backwards when you accelerate. This contraction means that, in your moving inertial frame, an inch on a ruler would still be an inch to anyone else in your reference frame, but might be longer or shorter to someone else moving differently from you - and the difference would be exactly enough that if you measured the speed of light (as distance/time) using that ruler, you'd get the same results. The other person's ruler would likewise look longer or shorter to you. What's really fun is that it's not just rulers, it's clocks too. If you measured a second, it would still be a second to you, but to someone moving differently it would be longer or shorter (and vice-versa), again just enough that all measurements of the speed of light would be identical for both of you. (This leads to a bizarre feature of the Universe, the relativity of simultaneity: two different observers can disagree as to the order of two events happening, one would see event A happen before event B, while the other would see the opposite...*and they'd both be right*.) So now you know that rulers shrink when you travel. Now, to simplify things further, go back to normal driving. Say you're driving to work. If you double your speed, you get there in half the time. If you quadruple your speed, you get there in a quarter of the time. If you went the speed of light, you'd get there at the same time you left, because your ruler would be shrunk to the ""unit"" length. (And if you went faster than the speed of light, you'd get there before you left, because your ruler would go ""negative"", which has plenty of its own problems.) Remember that mass and energy are the same thing. The faster I'm going (relative to you) when I hit you, the more energy is conveyed: I hit you harder going 20 MPH than I do going 10 MPH. As force is equal to mass * energy, we can view this as me getting more massive the faster I go relative to you. The amount of mass I gain relative to you grows and shrinks in the same way as the clock and the ruler, such that people traveling the same speed and direction as me see me have the same amount of mass I always have, while you (because I'm hurtling toward you) see me having more. Additionally, since mass takes energy to accelerate, as I gain mass, I need more energy to accelerate, and then I gain more mass, so I need more energy to keep accelerating... Because the speed of light is constant in all reference frames, the mass thing also varies like the rulers and clocks do, such that if I were traveling the speed of light, I'd have infinite mass (because I would appear to be traveling in at the speed of light in all reference frames). So it turns out that if I'm going the speed of light, I have infinite mass. Moving an infinite amount of mass takes, you guessed it, an infinite amount of energy. So you can't go the speed of light unless you get an infinite amount of energy (impossible) or have no mass (i.e. you are a light particle). This is grossly simplified, and is also drawing on decades-old memories of school, and I'm most certainly not an expert, but I think I'm vaguely right in the generalities.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.34, 'recall': 4.09, 'fmeasure': 7.66}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.02, 'recall': 0.47, 'fmeasure': 0.88}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 41.38, 'recall': 2.8, 'fmeasure': 5.25}}"

You're back where you started. Here's the deal. In the complex plane, x means ""real numbers"", y means ""imaginary numbers"". so for example (2,7) would mean 2+7i. So (1,0) means 1+0i (or just 1)....(0,-1) means 0+-i (or just -i) and so on. What is 180 degrees in terms of radians? Well, it's just pi. So e^ pi * i = e^ 180 x i = (-1,0) = -1+0i (or just -1). So now you have e ^ pi * i =-1. Add 1 to both sides of the equation, I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.

How was the speed of light measured? I know it had to do with light and mirrors and mountains but after that I'm completely lost.,"le to connect to the network, so it isn't able to connect to the network. It's a simple way of figuring out what your phone is doing.  ","Leon Foucault (of ""Foucault's pendulum"" fame) measured the speed of light to a very high precision in the 1860s, using a variation on this experimental setup: He used a lantern instead of a laser, obviously, but the principle is the same. URL_0 Take a mirror that's rotating at a known set rate, and shine a pulse of light at it. The light bounces off the rotating mirror, out to a stationary mirror a long way away, and back to the rotating mirror. In the time it took the light to bounce out to the stationary mirror and back, the rotating mirror rotated a little bit, so the pulse doesn't end up bouncing back to the original laser/lantern. Instead it bounces a little bit off to the side. The distance between the laser/lantern and the final reflected beam can be used to calculate the time it took the light to bounce between the mirrors, and thus the speed of light. The idea that light had speed (rather than being something ""instantaneous"") gained momentum with observations of Jupiter. The orbits of Jupiter's moons were established for quite a while, and some astronomers started writing out tables forecasting the time each [Galilean Moons]( URL_0 ) in the same way we forecast Moon/Sun rise and set times. Once the tables were established, an odd discrepancy was noticed. The tables were off, but were off in a very distinct pattern. The times would range from being spot-on, to being late (or early) by up to (about) a quarter-hour. By some clever geometry, it was eventually worked out that this was due to changes in the distance between Earth and Jupiter as the distance between them changes due to the planets' movement in their orbits. Newton made a good estimate of 7-8 light minutes between the Earth and the Sun, for example. It was not until later that we worked out the size of the various orbits and could measure the true speed (and not just relative transit time), but that was the beginning. The experiment you are thinking of used a wheel with a series of little windows. The idea was that a lantern was set so that the light could shine through the gap each time the wheel spun and the gap was in front of the lantern. A second wheel ten miles away could be set up in a similar fashion, blocking a mirror. Noting the RPMs of the wheels each time the ""signal"" (light) remains steady (rather than flickering) against the mirror allowed the scientists to work out possible speeds of light--that is, the speed or speeds that would be necessary in order for the ""signal"" to behave as it did (blocked or unblocked). Eventually competing teams were able to come to within about 1000 miles per hour of the correct speed, this is no small feat considering their only tools were lanterns, spinning wheels, and land-survey equipment (to measure the distance between the wheels). If memory serves, one team used two wheels, the other used a wheel and a spinning mirror, but my memory may be off in that regard.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.62, 'recall': 3.2, 'fmeasure': 6.06}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.71, 'recall': 0.56, 'fmeasure': 1.07}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 51.72, 'recall': 2.82, 'fmeasure': 5.35}}"

Since you'd be doing this with an adult, they'd learn a lot easier than a child, and once you've gotten a bunch of words across, they can ask you things and you can start explaining how to express higher concepts. Of course, they'd be teaching you if you wanted, and the more you each learn the faster you can explain things to each other. Language is something that has developed in all civilizations independently. When cultures came together physically making translation necessary, both cultures already had their own words for things. For example, water is the same thing everywhere but has different names like agua in Spanish, wasser in German, etc. it was just a matter of learning what other cultures called the same things. Some things may not exist in both places, for example, kindergarten is a German word that means garden for children and was imported by the US as a model for early childhood education. The word was adopted along with the philosophy. Sometimes, such as in the case of Algonquin, one of the primary languages spoken by people indigenous to North America, the ""winner"" in translation is about cultural dominance, in that the white settlers set up schools to re-educate Indian youth away from native languages to assimilate them. Many Algonquin words were lost in this forced translation. Sub-cultures and oppressed groups can also use language to rebel against mainstream cultures by re-labeling and/or reclaiming language used to dominate them such as queer, bitch, or fat and attaching an empowered translation of these terms.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.0, 'recall': 7.03, 'fmeasure': 12.12}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.08, 'recall': 0.64, 'fmeasure': 1.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.0, 'recall': 4.15, 'fmeasure': 7.16}}"

So you might have a sheet for the background, a sheet for static props, a sheet for a character's body, and another sheet on top for things that actually move. Things that move need to be on top because that sheet has to be swapped out for each frame, and that makes it possible to do so without disturbing the background. Since the background is behind several sheets of celluloid (and they're not *perfectly* transparent), objects that are actually the same color appear darker. Additionally, the backgrounds were often done as matte paintings rather than cell shaded flat colors, so it wouldn't be possible to match them perfectly.

Also, there is higher diversity and around 5x to 10x more people in the US than Canada and Germany, and there is some question about scaling of a universal health care system.

In the US, medical insurance became a perk that employers could use to keep/recruit employees. Wages were frozen, and even the ability to switch jobs was heavily restricted.

What happens when you suck water up a straw? The act of sucking comes from your mouth, but that isn't what actually propels the water up the straw. The force that pushes the water up is atmospheric pressure aka the weight of the air above your glass of water. By sucking on one end of a straw you lower the pressure and since the pressure on the glass of water is now higher, it forces the water up the straw. When you then put your finger over the end of the straw you are sealing it. When the water tries to fall out of the straw due to gravity there is nowhere for air to come in on the finger side and so it would produce a vacuum if it were to move down, and for that same reason, the air pressure holds it up in the straw. If you were to tilt the straw and lay it horizontal, eventually the water would pour out sideways because it would open a channel for air to move along the straw to replace the vacuum.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 39.13, 'recall': 10.59, 'fmeasure': 16.67}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.94, 'recall': 0.79, 'fmeasure': 1.24}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.54, 'recall': 7.45, 'fmeasure': 11.73}}"

Why do humans require such a comprehensive and well-balanced diet while most animals thrive on a seemingly limited number of food sources.," example, if you plugged a phone in and it was on, and a phone turned off, the phone will tell it to shut off. If you put the phone in a cold room, it's going to be a little more difficult to get it to work.  ","It's actually the other way around. Human can survive on one of the most diverse diet. Most animal have a very specific diet and can't usually change it. If they lose that source of food, they can often be in danger. Cats for exemple, lack the ability to produce certain aminos-acid and vitamins so they can't survive without meat to give them those things. Human can produce a lot of those so they mostly need a source of energy to produce what they need. They still need specific nutrient, but those are usually frequent and a lot of source of food can provide them. People can survive on a LOT of different diet. But of course as we know more have the exact need of our body, you can specify our diet to make sure that we get all of what our body need, but that's not needed to be relatively healthy or to stay alive. We don't really ""require"" a carefully balanced diet. Humanity as a species and would do fine if we all raised three kids and died from malnutrition around age 35. The problem is, we don't really like that idea. And if you want to live till you're 80, you need to take proper care of your body. And thus people have figured out some pretty great and healthy diets. That's not required (just look at people who eat nothing but junkfood), but it will greatly improve the odds of growing old. Think of it as maintaining a car. If you plan to scrap it after 50k miles, you can do whatever you want. But if you want to drive 350k on it, you need to change the oil, clean the filters, properly inflate the tires, use the right fuel etc. But you only have to do that if you want it to last a long time. Most of the advice for well-balanced diets is to extend your life. A human doesn't need to live for 60 or 80 or 100 years, but we want to. Evolution targets efficiency, and efficiency is ""live long enough to reproduce and then die as soon as you're not useful."" Humans can live to 40 on terrible diets, which is fine if you reproduce at 20. Most people don't want that lifestyle, so we use knowledge of medicine and our bodies to extend our life further than evolution deems necessary. Animals have all sorts of malnourishment problems. Humans just have enough food to be able to consider stuff like health and 'well-balanced diet'. Animals need that as well. For example cats that don't hunt need extra calcium in their food because they never eat bones (NEVER give your cat cooked bones, only raw) and so on. Without a balanced diet they will die or get sick as well. It's funny, I just got out of TAing a course about human brain development where we were talking about what constraints act on the development of large brains at a species level. Related to your question about diet is the question of cooking -- specifically, when foods are cooked they can allow us to extract more usable calories from them. As an adult human, your brain requires about 25% of your caloric intake daily. The development of skills like cooking as well as biological specializations to process certain foods makes our large and complex brain (relative to our body size and food consumption) possible! Not sure if this exactly answers your question, but it's interesting at least! If we had the same ambitions as most animals... To survive long enough to reproduce a few times, then die... Then we could worry a lot less about a balanced diet also. We could just eat bacon for 14 years or so, bang a few out, then die of a heart attack. Keep in mind that food intolerances are actually pretty common. 65% of adults have lactose intolerance. Most food intolerances have little or no research associated with them. Part of the reason why different cultures have different foods is due to living in different geographic environments where only certain types of of food can be grown. Prehistoric immigrants to these areas were forced to adopt to the local food sources or die You assumption is incorrect that animals don't need a wide variety of foods. Look up one of our closest relatives, the gorilla, for example. They eat hundreds of varieties of foods when in the wild. Think about a whale eating krill and plankton in the ocean. It also ingests every other thing in the water when it is feeding, and eats it. The problem is that in captivity it is very difficult or impossible to provide that level of variety, and we give animals supplements to compensate. The lack of variety and the lack of a need to spend hours a days foraging also creates behavioral problems for captive animals, because they don't need to and can't forage, but that's what they wired to do. Not all animals require a large variety of course. But I encourage you to reexamine the assumption in your question. We don't. Humans can live on a great number of different diets. That's why we can live literally ANYWHERE on the planet. There are two type of nutrients; micronutrients and macronutrients. The latter is what you need every day to keep going: fats, carbohydrates, and protein ( the body can actually sometimes finagle conversions between them). Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals we need in small amounts over the long run; they're what we need from vegetables and what makes ""superfoods"" super. Most carnivorous animals get their micronutrients from organ tissue- it's full of them, even though it's fallen out of style in our modern diets. That's how at least carnivores are able to get a complete diet; with herbivores I'd assume they just eat the right variety of plants. I should mention that the ""diet problem"" was the first problem addressed by the Simplex Method of Linear Programming. The issue is how to formulate a diet which includes all macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients in a minimum cost diet. [YouTube]( URL_0 ) The actual problem is larger than you will usually find in accessible resources. I lived with a guy who subsisted almost entirely on Jack & Cokes and nicotine. Not the healthiest guy but he could do it. to add to other people we really dont need to eat a large number of different things. we could eat the same meals every day and have the nutrition we need but we just dont like to do that when there is such a variety of foods made available to us. Isn't there a guy that's like 150lbs but has eaten nothing but pizza for the past ten years? It has to do with the amount of calories our brain requires to function is relation to our size. This can be easily compared to other animals and their brain sizes. There is a Ted talk a while back were this was greatly explained. I'll attach a link. URL_0 Related question: How do mammals not so different form each other have such opposite diets? e.g. the grazers that only each grass and leaves (zebra, giraffe, antelope etc.) and their prey that only eat meat. (lions, leopards, wolves etc.). Isn't someone not getting their vitamin C and beta kerotene? And isn't someone else not getting their protein and iron? You could survive on bread and water for a surprisingly long time (assuming it's old school bread made from unrefined stuff). However, you won't thrive. A diverse diet is recommended for best results. If you're only interested in survival, and you accept some health issues to go with it, then your diet could be very narrow and limited in range. It won't kill you, probably, but you won't be in the best of health either. This isn't quite the case. For example, despite what some may say - you can't feed a dog cat food for an extended period of time and expect them to stay healthy, and vice versa. This is because dogs' bodies require specific amino acids. Some of these amino acids they cannot make themselves (essential amino acids). These essential amino acids are different for dogs, cats, and even humans. The same is true for certain vitamins. Considering the fact that many animals are not omnivores but strictly carnivorous or strictly herbivorous, their food source options are even further limited to specific sources of food for survival. This is why the changes in the ecosystem are very impactful on the animal community.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 70.21, 'recall': 2.24, 'fmeasure': 4.34}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.57, 'recall': 0.61, 'fmeasure': 1.19}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 53.19, 'recall': 1.7, 'fmeasure': 3.29}}"

The sidewalk is so crowded that some people end up stepping on the lawn of the neighboring houses. Mr. Sneeze, living in one of the houses, sees this and gets out of his house to yell at the people to get off his lawn. The process is known as photic sneeze reflex and it affects 18-35% of the population. The mechanics behind it are not fully understood but it may be due to nerve signals being confused when there is a rapid burst from seeing bright light. It doesn't for everyone. About 18-35% of people are affected by this; it's called [photic sneeze reflex]( URL_0 ). I shit you not, there is another name for this condition that is way better than photic sneezing. It's Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst Syndrome. Or ACHOO for short :) [Proof]( URL_0 ) The optic nerve takes all the light information from the eyes to the brain. The maxillary nerve causes the sneeze reflex. These two nerves run next to each other for part of their course. When there is lots of electrical activity going down the optic nerve, then because they are next to each other, this activity can ""leak"" onto the maxillary nerve and push it over the limit, causing a sneeze. No one really knows. Some scientists say it's caused by confusion in the nervous system. Since all senses are linked, the pupil dilation response to light is translated to a nasal irritation and causes a sneeze. Other scientists suggest it's evolutionary, a trait that helped our ancestors survive in primitive life. (Clear the nose of smoke/other smells after leaving a cave to help smell threats/food sources). As someone who does this, I've noticed that squinting your eyes moves the sinus cavity.

Your next question might be, why wouldn't the giant creature move faster since it's so much stronger?

","When you turn to look at someone they can notice the motion of you turning and look at you, so it appears to you they have been staring at you. The rest is probably just confirmation bias. A study in 1913 where the test subjects could not see the person staring reported 50.2% correct guesses, indicating that there is no basis to whether someone is looking at you. URL_0 There is no reason to think that a human can. My guess as to why this myth persists would be a combination of good old fashioned confirmation bias. As well the fact the **you** turning your head gets the attention of the person you *thought* was looking at you causing them to look at you. So you see them looking at you & assume you were right. Your brain has evolved to keep you alive in the wild against literal lions, tigers and bears. It also helps you see prey and is geared for social interactions. You literally have brain circuits to notice when you see eyes. Even if you don't consciously notice it the feeling is there. Is it a deer in the trees? A large predator? Grognak the barbarian to ambush you? You don't know but the circuits activate and you feel on edge. Most people say its not real since there has been no scientifically supported and reproduced proof of any cause or even the feeling itself. However, and this is heading into anecdotal territory, I know a number of veterans and many have told me about how their escape and evasion trainers taught them to never look directly at the person you're hiding from. Instead watch them in your peripheral vision. I do casual experiments with this technique often and to be honest it definitely seems to work. Explanations given were varied including the most convincing and succinct: ""You can camouflage your whole body 'cept the whites of your eyes so don't show em.""","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.43, 'recall': 7.83, 'fmeasure': 13.4}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.64, 'recall': 0.6, 'fmeasure': 1.04}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.93, 'recall': 5.72, 'fmeasure': 9.79}}"
Why do SCUBA divers go into the water backwards instead of front first?,"one with built-in software on it. If you're on a phone that has a battery, it might have a very low battery life. If you're on a phone that has a battery, it might have a very low battery life.  ","If they don't go back first, they go feet first. Both for several reasons. 1. Out of the water, the tank is **heavy**. Imagine doing a belly flop while wearing a backpack full of cinder blocks. You hit the water, then the pack hits you. Ouch. 2. Hitting the water face first means you get the mask smacked into your face. Ouch again. 3. Some kinds of SCUBA gear will have bits extending behind your head. Going face first means you have a good chance of smacking the back of your head on them. Not fun. 4. When you hit the water, you are less concerned about landing on the guy that is already in the water than you are about the next guy in line landing on *you*. Going back first means you can see what's going on above you and move if needed. 5. Lastly, sometimes shit happens and you need to quickly ditch your gear. If you are face down, you have to get out from under the stuff after you undo the buckles, risking getting something getting caught in a stray loop. Face up means everything is below you, thus much less risk of getting snagged. In the PNW we very rarely use the seated back roll entry technique unless entering the water from a boat like a zodiac or similar. Usually we use a giant stride entry when entering from boats or docks. But the reason for the seated back roll is because when you're diving you have a lot of heavy and loose gear, and you want to be in control of it all and yourself the whole time. The seated back roll (SBR from now on) is really good for wrangling your hoses and accessories in front of you where it can all be held onto while at the same time holding the clasp of your weight belt. It also allows you to lead with the hardest heaviest and least fragile part of your body and gear: the tank. If say, a log floated up next to the boat while you were managing all your gear and getting ready to take a dip, and you didn't see it, when you roll backwards, your tank shields you from the blow of hitting the log from a small height with sometimes nearly 100 lbs of gear on top of you. It also serves to propeller you away from the boat quickly and with little effort. This way, you clear the boat, which may be bobbing up and down on rough seas, as well as allow someone else to enter behind you. It also serves to, usually, orient you facing the boat when you surface so you can signal the boat that you're OK and do not need assistance. Also, if the seas are you specially rough, your tank breaks the water for you so you don't get smacked in the face with an upswell right as the boat breaks the crest of the previous wave and you fall face first into it (no fun). Tl;Dr - it's easier and safer than the alternatives sometimes. Source - am PADI Divemaster, out of teaching status Master SCUBA Diver Trainer. Yes, I know, we have the best ""ranks/titles"" In short, divers have two main ways to ‘jump in’ from a scuba dive boat: The Giant Stride Entry (requires a stable platform from where to step off; common in larger boats) The Backward Roll Entry (preferred technique when the boat is smaller, less steady, and lacks a secure platform or ladder) Plus, think about this: walking around in fins is difficult and you're carrying the weight of a scuba tank (not light)- it's easier to roll backwards off the boat than to walk to the edge and stride off. One method is to take a step off the boat into the water - this works well when your boat has a platform that you can step straight off of into the water. If you're trying to enter the water over a gunwale going forwards, your flippers will get in the way, making it difficult to smoothly enter the water. Instead, divers sit on the gunwale, which allows them to smoothly lean back into the water, rather than making an awkward forward step over the gunwale. Sitting on the gunwhale also helps ensure you won't hit your tank or head against anything as you enter the water. Simple explanation for a five year old: Because it's easier to sit on the side of the boat and fall backward into the water than it is to lift your feet with fins, stand on the narrow side wall of the boat, balance yourself for a second without falling back into the boat, and then jump forward into the water. I understand what you meant, in fact most people did but divers can be dicks... So we have two different kinds of entries when diving. The first is called a 'giant stride entry' which is what is says on the tin. You take a big stride into the water. This is typically off of the back of a big hard boat or from a shore entry with a drop below. Don't hop in because you're likely to hit your cylinder on the entry point and knock yourself clean out (I've dragged a couple of people out who have done this.) The second, which is the one you're on about, [is typically out of a rigid hulled inflatable boat (RHIB.)]( URL_0 ) The reason we roll off backwards is because the boat will rock like crazy if you try to stand up in heavy dive gear. It's pretty low in the water and you're also less like to knock any gear off as you enter. Everyone needs to go at the same time or you risk clocking someone in the face with your cylinder. The super fun entries are negative entries using RHIBs off of big boats in strong currents - you roll into the water as a group with no air in your jacket and head straight down. Feels like being a navy seal. When walking from shore, it's easier to walk backwards with fins on. When sitting in a small boat you usually face inward while underway, and it's easier to just fall backwards over the side than to turn yourself around. Perhaps another reason is that hitting the water face first could dislodge your mask or regulator. Actually most SCUBA divers dont usually enter the water backwards, and ill get to that in a second. But first the answer to your question. I assume that the entry technique you are referring to is when the diver rolls backwards of the side of a smaller boat. In that case it is because when geared up you are crazy top heavy, and most people are not super graceful on land when in full gear. Couple that with a small and rolling boat, and you must be able to put your gear on and drop in to the water without standing up. It also minimizes the risk of people dropping in on top of each other, as divers will each drop from a different spot on the boat, and once they hit the water they can see the boat and get out of the way of the next diver. As a side note doing ""negative"" (non floaty) entries from small boats in rough waters makes you feel really cool. However there are many other entry techniques which are also very common. In a lot of places people dont dive of boats in the first place, and when shore diving you would just walk out into the water, or do a ""giant stride"" if there is a dock or something. A giant stride is common from bigger boats and is just a fancy word for stepping of the boat forwards. Of course there are tons of ways to get in to the water, and a part of being a good diver is to choose an appropriate one for the situation. When diving of my familys sail boat for example I usually make my gear buoyant and throw it down first before going in after it, since the entry is quite high and there is not much room up on the back. A favourite entry of mine as an alternative to a giant step, is to do three quarters of a flip forwards and land on the tank (on my back). But that is only with people I know, it looks kind of uncontrolled and is not a favourite with DMs and boat crew, its good fun tough. We only do that on boats where it's not practical to jump into water feet first, like on inflatable boats. Space in these boats is scarce and the two big tubes on the sides are hard to step over (especially with fins, in a thick suit, and with 25kg of gear on our backs). Standing on the tubes is dangerous as they are slippery, unstable and not flat , so it's easier (safer) to sit on them and fall backwards. Generally speaking, in an inflatable you avoid standing up when you have your gear on anyway. With any boat that has a big platform in the back, it's much easier to jump feet first.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 69.77, 'recall': 1.9, 'fmeasure': 3.71}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 23.81, 'recall': 0.63, 'fmeasure': 1.24}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 53.49, 'recall': 1.46, 'fmeasure': 2.84}}"
