Why there was a 'leap second' added to the end of 2016?,"The Earth is not a perfect sphere, it's a bit flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. This means that the rotation of the Earth is not perfectly regular. In fact, it's slowing down by about 2 milliseconds every year. That's not a big deal, but it's enough to make a difference over time. It's a bit like if you were trying to do a dance routine to a song that was just a bit too fast, you'd have to slow it down a bit. We do this by adding a 'leap second' to our clocks. It's like a little extra beat in the song. The leap second is added to the end of the year, which is why you might have noticed that 2016 had 86,400 seconds instead of 86,400 seconds."
How do you claim undiscovered land?,"Its a complicated question. The US has claimed many territories as its own, but in many cases this has been challenged by other nations. The US claims the Hawaiian Islands were annexed in 1898, but the Hawaiian Kingdom government was overthrown and replaced by a US-backed provisional government. The US claims the islands were annexed after a coup, and the coup was supported by the US. But the Hawaiian Kingdom government had not been overthrown, and the coup was not supported by the Hawaiian Kingdom government. The US claims the annexation was legitimate, but the US government has never provided proof that the annexation was legitimate. The US has also claimed the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam as its own, but these claims have also been challenged by other nations. The US claims the Philippines were annexed in 1898, but the Philippines was never part of the US. The US claims the Philippines were annexed by the US during the Spanish-American War, but the Spanish-American War was not a war between the US and the Philippines. The US claims the US annexed the Philippines in 1898, but the US had never been at war with the Philippines.  "
Why do we fail to do realistic human CGI (like in SW Rouge One) yet we do it so great on non-human beings (like in Warcraft)?,"It's hard to say. I think there are a few reasons. One is that humans are much more difficult to model than monsters. Monsters are easier to model because they don't have to be realistic. Humans are more complicated. They have to be able to walk, run, and move their face. They have to be able to interact with their environment. They have to be able to have a wide range of emotions. They have to be able to talk. They have to be able to listen. They have to be able to think. They have to be able to be realistic. We're not quite there yet. Another reason is that humans are much more difficult to model because humans are much more difficult to film. If you're going to film a human, you have to be able to film them in a way that makes them look realistic.   to film them in a way that makes them look realistic.   to film them in a way that makes them look realistic.   to film them in a way that makes them look realistic.   to film them in a way that makes them look realistic.   to film them in a way that makes them look realistic.

Why does 1080p on a 4k TV look better than 1080p on a 1080p TV?," , it's just that the 4k TV is able to display more pixels per inch than the 1080p TV. For example, if you look at the image above, the 4k TV has 3,840 x 2,160 pixels, which is 7.7 million pixels. The 1080p TV, on the other hand, has 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, which is 2.07 million pixels. So, the 4k TV has more than 3.5 times as many pixels as the 1080p TV. This means that the 4k TV has a much higher pixel density, which is the number of pixels per inch. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed the image will look. This is why you can see a difference in the image above."
How is property in outer space valued? If the earth colonized Mars what government/organisation would technically own it,"If it's owned by a country, then the country has the right to tax it, and the country can also use it for military purposes. If it's owned by a company, then the company has the right to use it for profit. The US government doesn't own any of the land on Mars, but if they did, then they would have the right to tax it, and they could also use it for military purposes. The US government has the right to tax any property owned by US citizens, and it can also use that property for military purposes."
"Why does lights make a ""blinking"" effect when looking at them from far away?","It's called persistence of vision. Your eyes can keep seeing an image for a fraction of a second after the light source is removed. So if you look at a light source and then look away, you'll see the image of the light source in your eye for a moment before it disappears. When you look back at the light source, it looks like the light source is blinking because it's switching on and off."
Why are internet speeds in America so slow,"
1. The internet is a shared medium, and the more users on the network, the slower it becomes. The more people you add to a highway, the slower it goes. 2.

How are pop-up and generally annoying web ads viable?," In short, they're not. They're just a way for companies to make money, because it's a cheap way to get people to see their ads. They're not viable because they're not targeted. They're just random ads that are shown to everyone, regardless of their interests or what they're doing on the site.

Why were slaves treated so badly?,"It is true that the slave trade was profitable. It was also true that many people were making money from it. It is also true that it was a very inhumane practice. However, people often forget that the profit was made from the suffering of the slaves. It is very easy to justify something when you don't see the suffering it causes. If you were to see the suffering that the slaves went through, you would not have been able to justify it. The slaves were treated so badly because they were treated as property rather than people. People are treated with respect and dignity because they are people.   are treated as property because they are things. In order to make money, the slave owners needed to keep the slaves in a state of subservience. If they were treated well, they would not be as productive. If they were treated well, they would be more likely to run away. If they were treated well, they would be more likely to rebel. If they were treated well, they would be more likely to be treated as people, and that would undermine the whole system. The slave owners also believed that the slaves were inferior to them.   were not people, but things.   were not as smart, they were not as capable, and they were not as important as the slave owners. Because of this, they were not treated as people.   were not treated with respect.  "
"Why do singers (*cough* Mariah Carey *cough*) have such a tough time when an earpiece or monitor isn't working, but the dancers are able to keep pace without anything?","The way the brain processes sensory data is by creating a model of the world that is used to make predictions about what the world will be like based on what we have experienced in the past. The brain uses a lot of different models to make predictions about the world. For example, we have models for how the world looks, how it sounds, how it smells, how it tastes, etc. The brain also uses models to make predictions about the world based on what we have learned from our past experiences. For example, if you see a red apple, you might predict that the apple tastes sweet. If you see a big red apple, you might predict that it tastes more sweet than a small red apple. If you see a red apple in a tree, you might predict that it tastes sweeter than a red apple on the ground. The brain uses these models to make predictions about the world. It uses the models to make predictions about what it is like to be a human, what it is like to be a cat, what it is like to be a tree, etc. When we perceive something, the brain is able to use its models to make predictions about what it is like to be the thing we are perceiving. This is how we know that our eyes are actually seeing the world.  "
Why is it so difficult to smell ourselves?,"The olfactory system is a very sensitive one, but it only detects very specific smells. It is not very good at detecting smells that are similar to other smells, but it is very good at detecting smells that are completely different. So, for example, it is very good at detecting the smell of something new, like a new car, but it is not very good at detecting the smell of something that is already familiar to it, like the smell of your house. It is also very good at detecting smells that are very strong, like the smell of smoke, but it is not very good at detecting smells that are very weak, like the smell of a flower. It is also very good at detecting smells that are very far away, but it is not very good at detecting smells that are very close. Because of these limitations, it is not very good at detecting smells that are very similar to other smells."
Why do comedians repeat phrases of their jokes/stories every so often while performing on stage?,"They're not repeating the same jokes, but rather the same punchline. You can tell because the setup is different. When they say ""this is the best part"", it's not the same setup, but the same punchline. It's like when you tell a story, and you want to tell it again but you don't want to tell it the same way. They're doing the same thing. It's like a refrain. It's a way to make it funnier, because you know the punchline is coming and you're waiting for it. It's a way to make the joke feel more like a song, where you know the chorus and you're waiting for it."

how does someone like bill gates keep all of his money?,"> I'm not sure what you mean by ""keep all of his money"". He has a lot of money, but it's not like he can just hold it in his hands. There's a lot of laws and regulations around money, and it's not like you can just make your own money out of thin air. Bill Gates has a lot of money because he owns a lot of stock in Microsoft, and because he's made a lot of money from Microsoft's success.

"Why is it when we chew/swallow food or drink, we don't gag but if we have to have a medical procedure that involves something going down our airway or dentist, we don't gag?"," Sounds like a weird question, but I'm genuinely curious. The question has been asked before, but the answers are very short and not very satisfying. I'm just a curious person. I'm not sure why you'd gag when you eat or drink, but I think it's because your brain is constantly processing and analyzing the sensory information it receives, and it's programmed to react negatively to anything that doesn't fit into its pre-existing schema. It's the same reason you don't gag when you breathe in air. It's just something your brain does. It's also the reason you can't hold your breath. Your brain just assumes that if you're not breathing in air, something must be wrong. It's the same reason you don't gag when you're swallowing. Your brain doesn't know the difference between swallowing food or swallowing air, so it doesn't react negatively to either. I'm not sure why you'd gag when you're having a medical procedure. It's possible that the sensory information your brain is receiving is different, and it's programmed to react negatively to it. I don't know. I'm just a curious person.  "
Why do newspapers often have random sentences where a l l t h e w o r d s a r e w r i t t e n l i k e t h i s?," S O M E T H I N G IS W R O N G . L O L . This is called a ""typographic error"" and can be caused by many things. It can be caused by the newspaper's printing press malfunctioning or by the newspaper's typists making mistakes. Sometimes it can even be caused by the newspaper's editor not proofreading the paper before it goes to print. There are many other possible causes, but these are the most common. Typographic errors are very common in newspapers because they are often printed very quickly and under tight deadlines. It is difficult to proofread and correct every mistake in a newspaper, so many of them are allowed to go to print. It is also common for newspapers to have typographic errors because they are often printed on very old printing presses. These printing presses were built many years ago and are often not as reliable as modern printing presses. They may break down or malfunction, causing typographic errors. Sometimes newspapers will intentionally print typographic errors in order to create a sense of humor or to make their newspaper more interesting. For example, the newspaper ""The Onion"" is known for printing fake news articles that are often very humorous and sometimes intentionally contain typographic errors. This is a way of making their newspaper more entertaining and engaging for their readers.  "
How does overuse of antibiotics actually lead to antibiotic resistant bacteria?,1. Antibiotics kill bacteria. The overuse of antibiotics kills more bacteria.

How can the heart not tire out?,"The heart is a muscle. Muscles have two ways of contracting: fast and slow. Fast contractions are called twitches, slow contractions are called tetanic contractions. The heart contracts in a slow, tetanic way. This means that it takes a lot of energy to make the heart contract, but it takes a lot of energy to keep the heart contracting too. The heart contracts at a rate of about 100 times per minute. That's a lot of energy, but it's a lot of energy that the body is able to use. The body also has a lot of energy available from its metabolism. The body can use this energy to pump blood. The heart is able to contract at a rate of 100 times per minute because it has a lot of energy available to it. The heart has a lot of energy available to it because it's a muscle. Muscles have a lot of energy available to them because they are able to use their metabolism to generate energy. The heart is a muscle, and it is able to use its metabolism to generate energy.

"Why can't devices (phones, laptops, etc) make our headphones noise-cancelling?","> Why can't devices (phones, laptops, etc) make our headphones noise-cancelling? Because the noise cancelling technology requires a lot of computational power. It's not just as simple as adding a microphone and an amplifier. You have to use signal processing algorithms to determine the frequency of the noise, and then generate a signal that is 180 degrees out of phase with the noise. And then you have to amplify that signal. That's a lot of computation. The noise cancelling headphones don't just use one microphone, they use multiple microphones. They also use signal processing algorithms to determine the frequency of the noise. They also use multiple amplifiers. It's not just as simple as adding a microphone and an amplifier. It's a lot of computation."
Why are the atomic numbers of elements unique?,"The number of protons in an atom is unique to each element. This is because protons are positively charged particles and they are attracted to electrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles and they are attracted to protons. Because of this attraction, electrons are not free to move around in an atom. Instead, they are contained within the electron cloud of the atom. The electron cloud is the region around the nucleus of the atom where electrons are most likely to be found. The electron cloud is shaped by the positive charge of the nucleus and the negative charge of the electrons. Because electrons are not free to move around in an atom, the number of electrons in an atom is fixed. This means that the number of protons in an atom is also fixed. The number of protons in an atom is equal to the number of electrons in the atom. This is why the atomic number of an element is unique."
How to type Korean?,"The Korean alphabet is called Hangul, and it's a phonetic alphabet. It's based on sounds, and each letter represents a sound.

What is the point of Gerber Life? How does taking a life insurance policy out on your baby give them a good financial start?," Certainly, I'm not an expert, but I'll give it a shot. The idea is that if you die, the life insurance will be paid out to your family. The money can be used to pay off debts, to support your family, or to otherwise help them financially. It's a way to ensure that your family will be taken care of if you pass away. In the case of a baby, the policy is usually taken out by the parents. The parents are the ones who pay the premiums and are the ones who would receive the payout if the policy is paid out. The idea is that the parents will be able to use the money to pay for the baby's education, to support the baby if they are unable to work, or to otherwise help the baby.

Why is Norton hated so much? What makes an antivirus/antimalware program good or bad anyway?,"Norton is hated for several reasons, some of which are valid, some of which are not. Firstly, Norton has a bad reputation for causing problems with other software. It’s not uncommon for Norton to interfere with other software, especially with things like internet browsers. This is one of the reasons why Norton is hated. Secondly, Norton is very aggressive when it comes to scanning. Norton is very good at detecting and removing malware, but sometimes it’s too good. It can scan files and folders that aren’t actually malware, and it can even scan files and folders that are in use by other programs. This can cause problems, especially if you’re running a business or working on a project. You don’t want Norton scanning your files and folders while you’re working on them. Thirdly, Norton is a very expensive antivirus program. It’s not as expensive as some other antivirus programs, but it’s still a lot of money. It’s also not the best antivirus program out there. There are cheaper antivirus programs that are just as good, and some that are better. Finally, Norton has a bad reputation for being a resource hog. It uses a lot of CPU and memory, which can slow down your computer. This is another reason why Norton is hated.  "
why is wearing something bright orange when hunting recommended? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of blending in?,"Bright orange is a very visible color, and as such it's hard to blend in with. The reason it's recommended is because it's the easiest color to see. This is because the color orange is often associated with safety, and so people are more likely to look for it. Hunters often wear bright orange to make it easier for them to be seen by others, and so they can see other hunters. The color orange is also less likely to be confused with the color of the surroundings, which is one of the reasons it's recommended."

"If you were travelling faster than the speed of sound, what would happen if you screamed?","If you screamed you would feel the sound of your own screaming and it would seem to be coming from inside your head. It would also be very loud to you, but it would not be audible to anyone else. Edit: the other guy already explained this, but I'm going to add that this is the same thing that happens to light when it travels faster than the speed of light. The light that is in front of you is blue shifted, and the light that is behind you is red shifted. This is why it is called a blue shift. The blue shift is just the same thing as the red shift, just in the opposite direction."

"How do Youtubers earn money? I mean, how is revenue generated by simply watching a video. I understand it has something to do with the advertisements, but that is my question, how do ads help Youtubers earn money.","The video is monetized through ads. When a user watches the video, they are shown ads, and the creator of the video is paid for each ad shown. The amount paid to the creator of the video is determined by the number of views and the ad revenue generated. The more views the video gets, the more ad revenue it generates, and the more the creator of the video is paid. There are also other ways to make money on YouTube. For example, a creator can sell merchandise, like t-shirts, hats, etc. They can also make money by selling their own products, like a cooking video, or a book, or a course on something. They can also make money by promoting products, like a product they believe in, and earning a commission for each sale. They can also make money by partnering with brands, and creating content that is sponsored by the brand. I hope that helps!"

When you yawn, the muscles in your middle ear move. This movement can cause your Eustachian tube to move, too. Sometimes this movement can cause the Eustachian tube to open, and then close again. When this happens, it can cause a clicking sound in your ears. This is usually a normal thing, and it doesn't usually cause any problems. But sometimes, the Eustachian tube can become inflamed. This can happen if you have a cold, or if you have an allergy. When this happens, the Eustachian tube can become stuck, and it can't open and close properly. This can cause a clicking sound in your ears, and it can also cause pain in your ears. If you have this problem, you should see a doctor. They can give you medicine to help you feel better. They can also do a test to see if your Eustachian tube is stuck. If it is, they can give you a special shot to help it open again.  "
How does Shutterfly make profit when it gives away so many discounts and free things?,"I’ve worked in customer service for a company that gave away a lot of free things. We had a ton of discounts for certain things but when you factor in the cost of giving away free things, we still made money. The cost of giving away free things is very low. It’s a very low cost marketing strategy. If they didn’t have those promotions, they would not get as many customers. They would not have as many customers, and they would not have as many customers buying more expensive things. And they would not have as many customers coming back. They are trying to get you to come back. They are trying to get you to buy more things. They are trying to get you to buy more expensive things. They are trying to get you to buy more often.

What is a tensor?,"A tensor is a mathematical object that describes the transformation of one vector space into another. It's a generalization of vectors and matrices, which are special types of tensors. For example, if you have a vector space of 3-dimensional space, a tensor would describe how to turn one vector in 3-dimensional space into another vector in 3-dimensional space. A matrix is a specific type of tensor that describes how to turn one vector in 3-dimensional space into another vector in 3-dimensional space. The other mathematical concept it relates to is the group theory. Tensor is a generalization of group theory. Tensor is a mathematical object that can be thought of as a group. Group theory is the study of groups, which are mathematical objects that have a certain type of symmetry. For example, a group of rotations in 3-dimensional space can be thought of as a group of transformations that can be applied to a vector in 3-dimensional space. Tensor is a generalization of this concept. It is a mathematical object that can be thought of as a group, but it is a more general concept than a group. It can describe a wide range of mathematical objects, such as vector spaces, matrices, and functions.  "
The idea of space as a vacuum.,"The concept of space as a vacuum is a difficult one. This is because our everyday experience tells us that there is something in space, like the air that we breathe. But this is not what we mean when we talk about space as a vacuum. The concept of space as a vacuum means that there is nothing in space. It is a space that is completely empty. There is nothing in it. No matter, no air, no energy, no particles, no light, no nothing. It is just empty space. This is difficult to understand because we are used to thinking of space as something that is full of things.

"Why is there a separate security code on credit cards? If the three extra digits make it that much more secure, why not just make the number three digits longer?"," The reason the security code is separate is that it is not part of the account number. This is important for a couple of reasons. First, if someone has your account number, they can use it to make purchases. If they have the security code, they can't. Second, the security code is used for verification purposes. If you're making a purchase over the phone or online, you need to enter the security code. If you don't have it, you can't complete the transaction. If you had to enter the security code along with your account number, it would be easier for people to steal your account number and use it for their own gain. The security code is a separate number, because it's used for verification purposes. If it were part of the account number, it would be easier for people to steal the account number. If you think about it, the security code is like a password. You need it to get into your account, but you don't want to give it to anyone else. The security code is not part of the account number, so you can keep it safe. The security code is not a part of the account number, so it can be used to verify that the person who is using the card is the one who has the account number. The security code is also used to protect against fraudulent charges.  "

My brother looks exactly like my dad when my dad was a baby. I currently look like my dad at his current age. My brother and I do not look alike nor related. How does this happen?,"You're talking about a thing called ""epigenetics"". This is the study of how environmental factors affect the development of an organism. In this case, your brother looks like your dad because he was exposed to the same environment as your dad. The same genes that were expressed in your dad were expressed in your brother, and that's why they look alike. It's important to note that this is not a guarantee that your brother will look like your dad when he's older, because he will have his own environment."
How do rebreathers work?,"A rebreather is an underwater breathing device that takes in the air you exhale and recycles it back to you. This allows you to breathe indefinitely underwater. It's kind of like a big air tank that you can never run out of air. To make this work, the rebreather uses a chemical process called scrubbing. This process removes carbon dioxide from the air you exhale and replaces it with oxygen. The rebreather is also filled with a liquid that helps to scrub out any other impurities from the air. The rebreather then recycles the air back to you by passing it through a filter that removes any impurities. This air is then mixed with oxygen and a special gas called helium, which helps to make the air easier to breathe. Finally, the air is pumped into your mask and you can breathe it in."
How do card readers know that a card has a chip?,"A card reader has a small light source (usually a laser) and a small light detector (usually a photodiode). When you insert the card, the light source is shone through the card, and the detector detects the light that is reflected back. If the light source is reflected back, then the card has a magnetic strip. If the light source is not reflected back, then the card has a chip. There are also cards with no magnetic strip at all, and they are called ""contactless"" or ""smart"" cards. These cards have a RFID chip that can be read wirelessly, and they don't have a magnetic strip at all."
"Why do most spiders have many eyes, but poor vision?","Spiders have eight eyes, but each eye is very small and can only see a very narrow field of vision. So they have a lot of eyes, but they can't see a lot with any one of them. The other reason is that spiders have very poor vision in general. They don't have the same kind of retina that we have in our eyes, so they can't see very clearly. But they have very good night vision and can see very well in the dark."
Memory assignment in hardware," It's the process of assigning memory locations to specific hardware components. This process is done by the operating system and is usually a low-level process. It's the process of assigning memory locations to specific hardware components. This process is done by the operating system and is usually a low-level process. For example, the operating system might assign a specific amount of memory to the CPU, another specific amount to the GPU, and another specific amount to the RAM. The operating system also assigns memory to the hard drive, network card, and other hardware components. Memory assignment is important because it allows the operating system to ensure that the CPU has access to the memory it needs to perform its functions. The CPU needs to access memory in order to perform its functions. The operating system ensures that the CPU has access to the memory it needs by assigning it a specific amount of memory. This is done by the operating system assigning the memory to the CPU. When the CPU needs to access a memory location, it sends a request to the operating system. The operating system then checks to see if the memory location is available and if it is, it sends the request back to the CPU. The CPU then accesses the memory location.   memory to hardware components by using a process called memory mapping.

School Choice," Do you think it's a good idea to give parents the option to choose a school for their child? Why or why not? This is a very important question. The answer is not as clear as it may seem at first. This is a very complicated topic. In theory, it seems like a good idea to give parents the option to choose the school their child will attend. This would give parents the power to choose the school that best suits their child's needs. It would also allow parents to choose a school that is closer to their home, or one that offers a particular program that they want for their child. It would also allow parents to choose a school that is in a safer area, or one that is better funded. It would also allow parents to choose a school that has a better reputation, or one that has better teachers.

"How was the canyon diablo meteorite, an object not from earth, used to determine the age of the earth?","nobel prize winner Luis Alvarez used the meteorite to determine the age of the earth. In 1950, Alvarez and his team found a 16-centimeter-long iron-nickel meteorite, which they named Canyon Diablo, in Arizona. Alvarez and his team used the meteorite to determine the age of the earth by studying the ratio of uranium-238 to lead-206 in the meteorite. They found that the ratio of uranium-238 to lead-206 was much higher than the ratio of uranium-238 to lead-206 in the earth’s crust. They used this information to calculate the age of the earth. They found that the earth was 4.5 billion years old, which was much older than the 100 million years old that was believed at the time. This discovery was a major breakthrough in the field of geology and helped scientists better understand the earth’s history."
Why is the golden ratio common to so many things of different nature?,"The Golden Ratio is a mathematical constant that is a ratio of two quantities where the ratio of the smaller quantity to the larger is equal to the ratio of the larger to the whole. It is approximately 1.618. It is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction. It has been observed in the natural world, in the proportions of things such as the spiral of a nautilus shell, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the growth of a tree, the shape of the human body, the structure of DNA, and the arrangement of galaxies. It is also used in art, architecture, and design, and has been used to create a sense of balance and harmony in many works of art. The Golden Ratio is not a constant in the sense that it is a number that can be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction.

How do the police trace a bullet back to its gun?,"The police have to find the bullet and then compare it to a database of bullets that are known to be from a certain gun. If they find a match, they can then look for the gun that was used. They can do this by comparing the type of gun used to the type of bullet found. If it's a different type of gun, then it's not the same gun. If it's the same type of gun, then it's likely the same gun. The police also use ballistics testing to determine if a bullet is from the same gun. This is done by testing the bullet against the gun to see if the bullet was fired from the gun. The police can also compare the bullet to a database of bullets that have been used in crimes in the past. If the bullet is found to match a bullet that was used in a crime in the past, then they can look for the gun that was used to fire that bullet.

"Does the question ""what was before the Big Bang?"" even make sense?"," I've heard it argued that it doesn't make sense because the concept of time is inherently tied to the Big Bang and the universe. If we have no time, then what was before the Big Bang isn't really a question, it's just nonsense. I'm not sure if that's true, but it's a common argument. I've heard that it doesn't make sense because time is not absolute, but is relative to the observer. That means that the Big Bang is the beginning of time, and there was no time before it. This is the most common argument, and I think it's the most valid one. That being said, I'm not sure if it's the only valid one. I've also heard that the concept of time is not absolute, and that time itself is an illusion. That means that there is no time before the Big Bang, because there is no time. This is a bit more difficult to wrap your head around, but it's an interesting idea. I think it's worth considering."

Why and how do Epsom Salts soothe sore muscles?," It's not the salts, but the magnesium in them. Magnesium is a mineral that plays a crucial role in the body's ability to heal itself. It's involved in many processes, but one of its most important roles is in the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency of the body. Without ATP, cells can't function, and without ATP, muscles can't contract. Magnesium also helps to regulate the contraction and relaxation of muscles, and is involved in the production of neurotransmitters (the chemical messengers of the nervous system), which help to regulate the transmission of pain signals. This is why magnesium deficiency is associated with muscle cramps, twitches, spasms, and weakness. Magnesium is also involved in the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which helps to regulate the transmission of pain signals. This is why magnesium deficiency is associated with anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms. The body can only produce a limited amount of magnesium, so it's important to get enough magnesium through diet and supplements."
Bicameral legislatures - how do they work and why do they exist?,"Bicameral legislatures are a system where one legislative body is further divided into two separate chambers (houses) that have distinct and separate roles. The United States Congress is an example of a bicameral legislature, where there are two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives has 435 members elected by the people of their district. The Senate has 100 members, with two representing each state. The Senate has some special powers not given to the House of Representatives, such as the ability to ratify treaties and confirm presidential appointments. In other countries, the House of Lords is the upper chamber, while the House of Commons is the lower chamber. The House of Lords is made up of appointed members of the nobility, while the House of Commons is made up of elected representatives. The idea behind bicameral legislatures is to provide a system of checks and balances. Each chamber has its own distinct role and powers, and they are able to provide a different perspective on legislation. This allows for a more balanced system of governance. For example, the Senate is more conservative than the House of Representatives, and the House of Lords is more conservative than the House of Commons.  "
Why is the HD quality that comes out of my $25 indoor antenna better than what I used to get through a cable box?,"HD antennas use a different technology than cable boxes. Cable boxes are usually digital cable boxes that are connected to a cable company's fiber optic network. The signal is sent through the fiber optic network, and then converted to a digital signal. The digital signal is then sent to your cable box, and then sent to your TV. HD antennas on the other hand are analog antennas. They receive a signal from a broadcast tower, and then convert that signal into a digital signal. The antenna then sends that signal to your TV, and the TV converts it back into an analog signal. The reason that the antenna is better is that it can pick up more signals. Cable boxes have a limited number of channels that they can pick up, because they are connected to a cable company's network. HD antennas can pick up a lot more channels, because they don't have to be connected to a cable company's network. The antenna also has a better signal quality than the cable box, which means that the picture is clearer and more detailed."
How do we know animals are not as self-conscious as humans?,"A lot of the things we think of as ""self-awareness"" are just things we do that are conscious. For example, you can train a dog to recognize itself in a mirror. This is a sign of self-awareness. But the dog doesn't really understand what the mirror is. It's just a tool that it can use to see its own reflection. So, what we think of as self-awareness is just a tool that animals use. It's not a consciousness. Animals don't have the same level of self-awareness as humans. We have a lot of evidence for this. For example, animals don't have the same sense of self-preservation as humans. They don't have the same sense of self-defense. They don't have the same sense of self-awareness as humans.  ervation as humans. They don't have the same sense of self-defense as humans.

why credit cards are safer than debit cards?," P.S. I am not a financial advisor. But I can give you some information. 😊 Thank you for asking! I'll try to keep it simple. Credit cards are safer than debit cards because your credit card company is responsible for the security of your account. If your card is stolen, you can simply report it to the credit card company and they will take care of it. With a debit card, your money is directly taken from your bank account, so you need to report it to your bank. If someone else has access to your account, they can take your money. Credit card companies also have better security measures in place to prevent fraud. They use a chip, and a pin to make it harder to use your card for fraudulent purchases. Credit cards also have better fraud protection. So if you do get a fraudulent charge on your card, you will have to dispute it and the card company will work with you to get it reversed. Debit cards don't have this protection. Debit cards are just connected to your bank account. If your card is stolen, the thief can get your money. Credit cards are safer because your bank doesn't have your money. Credit cards are safer because the bank that issued the card has a liability to protect your money.  "
Why headlights can be seen from a mile away but only illuminate a few hundred feet in front of the car.,"Sounds like a trick question, but it isn't. It's actually a great question for physics and vision.   answer is that light travels at a finite speed, which is a lot faster than the speed of a car. Light can travel about 300,000,000 meters per second.   average car speed is about 50,000 meters per second. This means that light can travel 6 times faster than the car. Light can also travel through air and water, but not through solid objects. This means that light can travel through the air in front of a car, but not through the car itself.   light from the headlights will travel through the air and then be reflected off the road surface.   light will then bounce back to the driver, but the light will not be able to travel through the car itself.   car is made of metal and glass, which is opaque to light.   light from the headlights will be reflected off the road surface, but it will not be able to travel through the car.   light from the headlights will illuminate the road surface, but it will not illuminate the car itself.   car is opaque to light.   light from the headlights will travel through the air, but it will not be able to travel through the car.   car is made of metal and glass, which is opaque to light.

Why does a mere air bubble in the circulatory system prove to be fatal?," A lot of things are fatal, so that's not a very good question. If you mean why is an air bubble in the circulatory system fatal? Then the answer is that the circulatory system is a very delicate system, with lots of different parts, and the blood is moving really fast. An air bubble in the bloodstream can cause the blood to become blocked in a small area, which can cause the blood to not be able to get to a certain part of the body. This can cause damage to the cells in that area, and can also cause the cells to die. This can also cause a lot of pain, and can also cause the person to become very sick. If the air bubble is in the lungs, it can also cause the person to become very short of breath, and can also cause them to die."

"If fat is stored energy, why can't fat people not eat for a few days, be fine, and consume the fat","Fat is not stored energy. Fat is stored as fat. It is stored as a byproduct of the metabolism process. When you eat, your body burns the food you eat for energy. The leftovers are stored as fat. The fat is stored in your fat cells. If you eat less than your body burns, the fat cells will shrink. If you eat more than your body burns, the fat cells will grow. If you eat nothing for a few days, you will eventually die. You need to eat something to get the energy you need to survive. Fat is not stored energy, it is stored fat. Fat is made by your body from the food you eat, so you don't need to eat fat to get fat. If you don't eat for a few days, you will eventually die, because you can't live on fat alone."
US college football bowls," like the Rose Bowl, are played on January 1st. (or thereabouts). This is the day before the Superbowl, which is played on January 2nd. This was done intentionally to allow the college teams to have their own day in the sun before the NFL season kicks off. The reason for this is that the Superbowl is a huge event, and the NFL wants to maximize the amount of time they can spend on advertising and promoting the game. By having the college game the day before, they get to advertise for two days, and the NFL gets to focus on the Superbowl. In addition, the college game is not as big of a deal as the Superbowl, so the NFL is able to use the college game as a way to get more viewers for the Superbowl. & #x200B; As for why the NFL season kicks off on Thursday, it's because of the Superbowl.  ursday, to give the teams a chance to get ready for the Superbowl. & #x200B; As for why the NFL season starts on Thursday, it's because of the Superbowl.

Will sovereign states/countries ever shift from being republics to some different system of government just like how monarchies were slowly phased out? Why or why not?," The United States is a republic. It is a form of government in which power resides in elected officials and their elected representatives rather than in a hereditary leader or a small group of individuals. It is the opposite of a monarchy, which is a system of government in which power resides in the person of a king or queen. The United States is a democratic republic. The United States is a federal republic. The United States is a constitutional republic. But what exactly is a republic?   where the ultimate power rests in the people, who exercise it through their freely chosen representatives.   where the ultimate power rests in the people, who exercise it through their freely chosen representatives.   where the ultimate power rests in the people, who exercise it through their freely chosen representatives.   where the ultimate power rests in the people, who exercise it through their freely chosen representatives.   where the ultimate power rests in the people, who exercise it through their freely chosen representatives.   where the ultimate power rests in the people, who exercise it through their freely chosen representatives.   where the ultimate power rests in the people, who exercise it through their freely chosen representatives.

Why does driving long distances make people tired?,"The body is designed to be active all the time, not to be sitting still for long periods of time. When you are driving long distances, you are sitting still for a long time, which causes your body to feel tired. You also have to pay attention to the road, which takes a lot of energy. When you are tired, you are less alert, which makes it more likely that you will have an accident."
People who wake up after a head injury with a new ability (for example fluency in a foreign language),"are called ""sleep-onsets"". It's a rare phenomenon, but there are several documented cases. MRI scans of people who experience this phenomenon show that a certain area of the brain is more active during sleep than it is during wakefulness, which may be responsible for the sudden onset of new skills. There are many theories about how this phenomenon works, but no definitive explanation. Some people think that sleep is responsible for reorganizing the brain, and that this phenomenon is an example of this. Others think that sleep is responsible for ""forgetting"" old skills, and that the brain is able to relearn them during sleep. There is a lot of research being done on this phenomenon, and it's fascinating to see how much we still don't know about the brain."
What happens to our bodies when we don't get enough sleep over a long period of time?," Pulling from my own experience and a few sources I've found, here's my best shot at an answer. The general consensus is that you need at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night. The average person will have about 500-700mg of sleep debt per day. This is the amount of time you're not getting enough sleep. It's important to note that this number can vary greatly. The amount of sleep debt you have can be affected by factors such as age, lifestyle, and the quality of your sleep. The longer you go without sleep, the more sleep debt you'll accumulate. It's important to note that sleep debt can build up over time and can be difficult to get rid of. When you're sleep deprived, your body will try to make up for it by being more active. This means that you'll be more likely to get injured, and you'll have a harder time recovering from injuries. Your brain will also be affected. When you're sleep deprived, you'll have a harder time paying attention, remembering things, and making decisions. Your memory and cognitive abilities will be impaired. Your mood will also be affected. You'll be more irritable and less patient with others.  "

How come full siblings share only 50% genetic with each other and not 100% since they both have the same parents?,"Because of recombination. When the parents mate, they each have 23 chromosomes, each of which has a number of genes on it. These genes are inherited from their own parents, and so on. When the parents mate, the genes are combined randomly to form new combinations. This is called recombination, and it is the reason why siblings are not identical. The recombination process is a random process, and there is no way to predict what will happen. The same process also happens when cells divide, so two cells that are identical in terms of genes will have different combinations of genes."
"Why do we remember some dreams, sometimes for years, but tend to forget others right away?","հետարարություն Հայկ Մարգարյան Հայկ Մարգարյան 16:39, 15 October 2019 (UTC) Hi, I'm a neuroscientist. There are two main theories: 1) The activation-synthesis theory, and 2) The consolidation theory. Activation-synthesis theory: This theory suggests that dreams are not a random firing of neurons but a meaningful process that is controlled by the brain's attempt to consolidate memories. It's thought that the brain uses dreams to process and consolidate memories, to rehearse emotional experiences, and to practice problem solving. The idea is that the brain takes fragments of memories and stitches them together into a coherent narrative, which is what we experience as a dream. Consolidation theory: This theory suggests that dreams are the result of the brain's attempt to consolidate memories. When we dream, the brain is processing memories and rehearsing them to make sure that they are stored in the long-term memory. The idea is that the brain takes fragments of memories and consolidates them into a coherent narrative.  "

"Why are floppy discs called ""Floppy"" if they're not floppy?","The name ""Floppy"" comes from the early floppy discs, which were made of a soft, flexible material and were floppy in the sense that they could be bent and folded easily. The term ""Floppy"" was first used by IBM in the 1970s. It was meant to convey that the discs were easy to handle and bend, and that they were not rigid like a hard disc. Over time, the term ""Floppy"" became more widely used, and it became synonymous with any type of disc that was flexible. However, in the 1980s, the floppy discs were replaced by rigid discs, which were more reliable and faster. The term ""Floppy"" is now used to refer to any type of disc that is flexible, regardless of whether it is a hard or a soft disc. The term ""Floppy"" is a misnomer, and it is not accurate to describe any modern disc as ""floppy"". The name ""Floppy"" is actually a misnomer, as the early floppy discs were not very floppy at all. They were made of a flexible plastic material, but they were not very flexible. They were also not very floppy.  "
Shadowbanning,"When you type in a URL into a search bar on a website, it’s called a “query” or “search”. It’s essentially a request to the website to search its database for the term you entered. The website then generates a list of relevant results based on the query and displays them. In the case of the website you mentioned, the results are displayed in a new tab. This is because the website is built on a different platform than the search engine you’re using. The website is built using a programming language called PHP. The search engine is built using a programming language called JavaScript. When you type in a URL into the search bar, the search engine uses JavaScript to send a request to the website and generate a list of results based on the query.

How do data collectors account for people who put random answers in surveys?,"Well, the first thing they do is to check the responses against a control group. They then also have to be able to detect if the response is out of the ordinary. For example, if 100 people answer a question about their age, but one person says they are 200, they will probably detect that. They also have to be able to detect if the responses are randomly generated. For example, if 100 people answer a question about their favorite color, but one person gives 10 different answers, they will probably detect that. I'm not sure about how they do it, but I'm sure they have a system."

In WW2 movies and RL videos some soldiers salute and some use nazi salute. Why is that?,"The Nazi salute was a very specific salute, with the arm straight and the palm facing downwards. The Nazi salute was used by the Nazi party in Germany, and it was used by the Nazi party to show that they were loyal to the Nazi party. In the movies, soldiers are often shown to be loyal to the Nazi party, and so they would use the Nazi salute.

"Why do companies use such low amounts of natural juice in soda, is there a reason for this? And are all the other components really necessary in such amount?","It's not a law, but rather a standard. The FDA has a list of ""Generally Recognized As Safe"" (GRAS) ingredients, which are ingredients that are generally considered safe for consumption by humans. In the case of soda, the FDA has designated carbonated water, sugar, and natural flavors as GRAS ingredients. They also list artificial flavors as GRAS, but those are only used in small amounts in most soda. The FDA also has standards for the amount of each ingredient that can be used in a food product. For example, a food product cannot contain more than 10% sugar by weight, and cannot contain more than 1% artificial flavor by weight. Soda companies can use the FDA's standards to determine how much of each ingredient to use in their product. They can also use their own standards, which are often based on the amount of each ingredient used in similar products. For example, if a company wants to make a product that tastes like a competitor's product, they will want to use the same amount of sugar and artificial flavor as that competitor. The amount of sugar in soda is regulated by the FDA, but the amount of artificial flavor is not.  "

Church-Turing thesis and tests,"The Church-Turing thesis is a hypothesis that all computations can be performed by a Turing machine. It is a fundamental concept in computer science that has been widely accepted and is a key concept in understanding the nature of computation. A Turing machine is a theoretical computer that consists of a tape that can hold an infinite amount of information and a head that can read and write information on the tape. It also has a finite set of states, a finite set of symbols, and a finite set of rules for transitioning between states. The Church-Turing thesis is a hypothesis that says that any algorithm can be performed by a Turing machine. This means that any algorithm, no matter how complex, can be implemented as a sequence of instructions that a Turing machine can perform. This thesis was first proposed by Alan Turing in the 1930s and later formalized by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. The Church-Turing thesis is important because it shows that all computations are computations by a Turing machine. This means that all computations can be performed by a computer, no matter how complex. It also shows that there is no fundamental difference between a computer and the human brain. The human brain is essentially a computer that can perform all computations.  "

How does credit card works/credit,"card payment process
 Dont know if it is a good question or not, but here is my answer: A credit card is a debt instrument. The credit card company provides the user with a line of credit, which is an agreement to pay the credit card company back in the future. The credit card company charges interest on the unpaid balance of the credit card, which is the amount of money that the user owes the credit card company. When the user makes a purchase, the user provides the credit card information to the merchant, who then sends the payment to the credit card company. The credit card company then debits the user's account, which is the amount of money that the user has available to spend. The credit card company then sends the payment to the merchant, who can then use the money to pay their bills or buy more stuff. Credit card companies are businesses that provide loans to customers. Credit card companies make money when customers use their credit cards. Credit card companies can make money in several ways. They can charge customers an annual fee for the right to use their credit card. They can charge customers interest on the money that they borrow. They can charge customers a fee for using their credit card. They can charge customers a fee for not paying their credit card bills on time. They can charge customers a fee for using their credit card abroad.  "
What causes the feeling of weak muscles when you have a cold or a flu?,"Muscles are not just the muscles that you can see and touch.

"Why is it that, during menstruation, the womb lining is broken down, only to be built up again almost immediately?","Your body has a very complex and efficient system for removing blood from the body. The blood is transported through the veins to the heart, which pumps it to the lungs, where it is oxygenated. The oxygenated blood is then pumped to the rest of the body. The menstrual cycle is a natural process that is controlled by the hypothalamus in the brain. It is a monthly process of ovulation, where an egg is released from the ovary. The egg is then transported through the fallopian tube to the uterus, where it can be fertilized by a sperm. If the egg is not fertilized, the uterus will shed its lining, which is menstruation. This is a very efficient process that is controlled by hormones, and is very important for the survival of the species. It is a natural process that has been occurring for millions of years, and has been evolved to ensure that the species survives. It is also a very important part of the menstrual cycle, as it is a time of ovulation, which is when the egg is released from the ovary. This is when the egg is most fertile, and is the time when fertilization is most likely to occur."

The concept of falsifiability. I just can't understand it.,"Falsifiability is a concept in scientific theory. It is the idea that the theory must be able to be proven false. If it can't be proven false, then it is not a scientific theory. This is important because if a theory is not falsifiable, then it is not a theory. It is a belief, and beliefs are not science. A theory is a set of ideas about the world that have been tested and found to be true. They are the best explanation we have for how the world works. Falsifiability is a way of checking whether a theory is true. If a theory is falsifiable, then it can be proven false. If it can't be proven false, then it is not a theory. It is a belief. Falsifiability is important because it allows us to check whether a theory is true. If a theory can't be proven false, then we don't know whether it is true or false. Falsifiability is important in science because it allows us to test our theories. If a theory can't be tested, then it is not a theory. It is a belief."

Pickles are also a big part of the cuisine in the Middle East. So it is not surprising that the people who immigrated to the US have a strong preference for pickles. It is also a big part of the cuisine in Mexico, and that is why dill pickles are popular in Mexico. The other two flavors, ketchup and all dressed, are not as popular in Europe and the Middle East. But they are popular in the US because they are very versatile. They can be used in a lot of different recipes. And they are also cheap."
What would happen to astronauts in orbit if earth instantly disappeared?,"It's not that they would disappear, it's that the gravitational forces acting on them would cease. They would continue in their orbit for a little while, but eventually they would begin to drift off in whatever direction the local gravity field was pointing. If the local gravity field was pointing towards the sun, they'd be pulled towards the sun. If it was pointing away from the sun, they'd be pulled away. If it was pointing towards the direction of the nearest planet, they'd be pulled towards the planet. Eventually, they'd be pulled off into interstellar space. If they were in a spacecraft, they would eventually drift off into space. If they were on a spacewalk, they would drift off into space. If they were in a space station, they would drift off into space. If they were on a planet, they would eventually drift off into space. If they were in orbit around a planet, they would eventually drift off into space. If they were in a black hole, they would eventually drift off into space. If they were in a wormhole, they would eventually drift off into space. If they were in a universe with no matter, they would eventually drift off into space.

Why is the side order of fruit at American restaurants an overwhelming amount of cantaloupe and honeydew?,"I can’t say for all of them, but the one I went to said it was because they don’t have to pay for it. They get it free from a local farm. They also said that’s what most people want anyway. I’m not sure if it’s true or not, but it’s what I was told."
Why does cabin depressurization cause a plane to crash?,"The pressure in the cabin is lower than the pressure outside the plane. If you look at the pressure in the cabin, you will see that it is lower than the pressure outside. The difference between the pressure inside and outside is called pressure difference. This pressure difference is very small, but if you have a large pressure difference, it can cause damage to the plane. The pressure difference causes a force on the plane. This force is called lift. The lift is caused by the pressure difference. The lift is very small, but if you have a large pressure difference, the lift can cause the plane to crash. This is why it is important to keep the pressure inside the cabin constant. If the pressure inside the cabin is too low, the plane will not be able to fly. If the pressure inside the cabin is too high, the plane will not be able to fly. If the pressure inside the cabin is too high, the plane will not be able to fly. If the pressure inside the cabin is too low, the plane will not be able to fly. This is why it is important to keep the pressure inside the cabin constant."
Why does holding down the power button on devices work even when the system is frozen?,I'm guessing it's a language order thing. The first word in the list is usually the most important one.

The fifth word is usually the software version. The sixth word is usually the build number.
"When they say ""we didn't have the technology then,"" what does that specifically refer to? Why were USB sticks only able to hold 500 MB a few years ago but are now able to hold hundreds of GB? What specifically changes in that time frame?","The ""we didn't have the technology"" line is a pretty common cop out that people use to avoid talking about the fact that they are making an excuse. If they say ""we didn't have the technology"" it means they were either too lazy or too cheap to do the work. The USB sticks that you are referring to are a good example. USB was invented in the late 1990s, but it wasn't until the early 2000s that USB 2.0 was invented, and it wasn't until the mid 2000s that USB 3.0 was invented. The technology was there, but it wasn't until it was more widely adopted that it was possible to make larger capacity USB sticks. Another example is hard drives. Hard drives were invented in the 1950s, but they didn't become widely used until the 1980s. The technology was there, but it wasn't until it was more widely adopted that it was possible to make larger capacity hard drives."
What is that feeling we get in our stomach when we're hungry? Why does it happen?,"- The feeling we get in our stomach when we're hungry is called hunger. Hunger is a signal that our body needs food. Hunger is caused by a lack of food. When we eat, our body takes the food we eat and breaks it down into tiny little pieces called nutrients. The nutrients are then absorbed into our bloodstream. Our body then uses these nutrients to build and repair our cells, make energy, and make hormones. When we haven't eaten for a while, our body starts to feel hungry. This is because it needs more nutrients. The hunger feeling is like a message to our body saying, ""Hey, we need more food! Let's go get some!"" - We've evolved to get hungry when we're hungry because it's important for our survival. If we don't get enough food, we will die. So, our body is very good at telling us when we're hungry. It's like it's our job to make sure we get enough food. - When we're hungry, we feel a gnawing or rumbling in our stomach. This is caused by our stomach making gastric juices to help break down the food we're about to eat.  "
"A deer can eat poisonous plants like rhoderdendrons because they don't have a gall bladder. When a doctor removes a humans gall bladder, are they too able to eat poison without feeling ill?","No. The gallbladder is not the only organ that deals with toxins, but it is the most important. The gallbladder stores bile which is used to digest fats. It also stores toxins that are picked up by the liver. When a deer eats a plant that contains toxins, the toxins are stored in the gallbladder. The gallbladder acts as a filter for toxins and it can only hold a small amount of toxins. When the gallbladder is full, the deer will vomit. This is the same mechanism that helps a human vomit when they have eaten something bad. When a deer eats something bad, they can vomit it up. If they don't vomit, the toxins will go into their bloodstream. The liver is the organ that deals with toxins. It takes the toxins out of the blood and stores them in the gallbladder. The gallbladder acts as a filter for the toxins. When a deer has a full gallbladder, the liver will start to release toxins into the bloodstream. The deer will start to feel sick and will vomit. When the deer vomits, the toxins are gone.  "

What stops us from getting cell phone interference?," In a nutshell, we don't get cell phone interference because the frequencies used by cell phones are not used by other electronic devices that are in the same area. When we talk about cell phone interference, we're talking about electromagnetic interference (EMI). EMI is caused by the interaction of electric and magnetic fields. Cell phones use radio waves, which are a type of electromagnetic radiation. Radio waves are the same type of radiation used by radio stations to broadcast music. The only difference is that radio waves are used in a very specific frequency range. Cell phones use frequencies in the range of 800 MHz to 1900 MHz, while radio stations use frequencies in the range of 500 kHz to 1700 kHz. Because the frequencies used by cell phones are not used by other electronic devices, they don't interfere with each other. In fact, cell phones are designed to be able to operate in the presence of other types of radiation, such as radio waves. There are a few things that can happen when cell phones are used in the presence of other types of radiation. One of these things is that the phone will automatically change the frequency it's using to avoid interference. This is known as frequency hopping. Another thing that can happen is that the phone will automatically turn off.  "

"Why is it easy to count by 2's and 5's, but not by other numbers like 7's and 8's.","Because those numbers have a power of 2 in their number representation. For example, 7 = 2^3, 8 = 2^4. The reason you can easily count by 2's is because 2^2 = 4, which is 2 times 2. So 2^2 + 1 = 3, and 2^2 + 2 = 4, and so on. The reason you can easily count by 5's is because 5 = 2^1, and 2^1 + 1 = 3, and 2^1 + 2 = 4, and so on.

It’s the muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels, and skin too. The skin has to be kept clean and dry to prevent infection. The blood flow has to be restored to prevent gangrene and to promote healing. The nerves have to be stimulated to prevent nerve damage and to promote sensation. The muscles and tendons have to be stretched to prevent muscle atrophy. The ligaments have to be stretched to prevent joint instability. The bone has to be stimulated to prevent bone loss.

What determines your blood type and what's the difference between positive and negative?,"Blood is made of red and white cells. The red cells are the ones that carry oxygen to the body. The white cells are the ones that fight infections. The white cells have two types: positive and negative. The positive cells have a special protein on their surface called A. The negative cells don't have the protein. The red cells have another protein called B. The positive cells don't have the protein either, but the negative cells do. There are four types of blood: A, B, AB, and O. They are determined by the combination of the proteins A and B. People with type A blood have the A protein on their red cells and the B protein on their white cells. People with type B blood have the B protein on their red cells and the A protein on their white cells. People with type AB blood have the A and B proteins on their red cells and the A and B proteins on their white cells. People with type O blood have neither the A nor the B protein on their red cells or white cells."
Why do so many websites let you use gmail/facebook as login information,"The reason you can use Gmail/Facebook as login information is because these services are built on top of open standards.

Why is the feeling of impending doom a real symptom and how does someone know they're dying?,"It is not a real symptom. People who are dying often feel a sense of peace, not a sense of impending doom. This is because the body has a natural response to a serious illness, and that response is to shut down. The body knows that it is dying, and it shuts down so that it can die in peace. This is a natural and necessary process, and it is something that we can all look forward to. It is not something that we should fear, but rather something that we should embrace. It is a sign that our life is almost over, and that it is time to let go.

As I lie here at 3am I wonder- why do people have trouble falling asleep at a reasonable time even when they wake up early and are tired during the day?,"Because of the circadian rhythm, which is the body's internal clock. It's controlled by the hypothalamus and is regulated by a small group of hormones. The most important hormone is melatonin, which is produced by the pineal gland. It's the hormone that tells your body it's time to sleep. Melatonin is produced in response to darkness, and it's suppressed by light. This is why you get tired at night. The reason you're tired is because your body is producing melatonin, and that's the hormone that makes you sleepy."

"How in the American Justice system can a prosecutor prosecute someone when the alleged ""victims"" strongly oppose prosecution","
 Crim law 101 here. Victim's right to be heard. I'm not sure what the specifics of this case are, but the victim's right to be heard is a pretty important concept. In general, the victim has the right to be heard in court, and the court has to consider the victim's statement in deciding whether to prosecute. The victim's statement is not binding, but it has to be considered. If the victim opposes prosecution, the court will have to consider why the victim opposes it. Is it because the victim is afraid of the defendant? Is it because the victim doesn't want to relive the trauma? Is it because the victim doesn't want to be involved in the trial? Or is it because the victim is afraid of the defendant's family? The court will have to consider all of these things when deciding whether to prosecute. But the court also has to consider whether the victim is being unreasonable. If the victim is being unreasonable, the court will have to weigh that against the victim's statement. It's a very nuanced process, and it's not always easy to do. But the victim's right to be heard is a fundamental right in the American justice system."
"The main difference of a fruit and vegetable is that fruits have seeds.

Most vegetables are the reproductive parts of plants, and therefore have seeds. Fruits are the reproductive parts of plants that contain seeds. Fruits are a type of plant reproductive structure. Vegetables are a type of plant reproductive structure. Vegetables are the edible parts of plants, usually the leaves, stems, or roots. Fruits are the edible part of plants that develop from the ovary of a flower. A fruit is a type of plant reproductive organ that produces seeds. A vegetable is a type of plant reproductive organ that does not produce seeds. In the US, we use the term ""vegetable"" to refer to any plant part that is edible, including leaves, stems, roots, and even fruits. So, tomatoes are vegetables, but corn is a fruit. The reason for this is that tomatoes are grown on a vine and are not self-pollinating. They are also grown from seed, so they are considered a fruit. On the other hand, corn is grown on the ground and is self-pollinating, so it is considered a vegetable.  "

Why are we only able to accept blood transfusions of the same blood type?,"Blood is made up of four different types: A, B, AB, and O. The type of blood you have is determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins on the surface of your red blood cells. These proteins are called antigens, and they are the reason why blood types are so important when it comes to transfusions. When your blood comes into contact with someone else’s blood, your body recognizes the antigens on the surface of the other person’s blood cells and mounts an immune response. This is why people with different blood types cannot receive blood transfusions from each other."
How did Crocodiles survive the extinction of dinosaurs?,"Because they were already present on Earth. It's not like they were in the same ecosystem as the dinosaurs, they were on the other side of the globe. They were also much smaller and not as prominent as the dinosaurs.

The reason they were able to survive is because they were not really effected by the dinosaurs. They were not in the same ecosystem as the dinosaurs and were not really effected by the mass extinction that occurred when the dinosaurs went extinct. They are also very resilient creatures and can live in a wide range of different climates.

The putamen is involved in the regulation of the speed of movement and is the source of a number of movement disorders. The globus pallidus is involved in the regulation of the speed of movement. The basal ganglia also plays a role in the regulation of the brain's reward system.  "

It's the same with most movies and TV shows. Is it just a lack of tech? Or is it a conscious choice to make the dialogue more important than the action? Is it just a matter of preference? I've noticed this too. I'm not sure if it's a matter of preference or if it's a deliberate choice. I think it's a matter of preference.

Would a mummy left undisturbed eventually turn into a human fossil?," , I am not an expert on this, but I know a little bit. I believe that a mummy will eventually decompose, but it depends on how well it was preserved. If the mummy was wrapped in linen and covered in resin, it might last for a very long time. If the mummy was wrapped in a different material, it would likely decay faster. There are mummies that have been preserved for thousands of years, and the process is fascinating. It involves the mummy being covered in resin and wrapped in linen, which is a very strong material. The resin prevents the mummy from getting wet and rotting, and the linen is very strong. If the mummy was buried in a dry place, it would last for a very long time. I believe that the mummy of a pharaoh was buried in a pyramid, and it is estimated to be over 3,000 years old. It is still in good condition, and scientists are able to study it."
"If heroin was available over the counter 100 years ago, why didn't most people become addicts?"," Drug addiction is a complex process that involves many different factors. The most important factor is the drug itself. Heroin is an extremely potent drug that can cause a strong physical and psychological dependence. The amount of heroin available in the 1920s was much less than what is available today, and the quality was not as consistent. This means that the risk of addiction was much lower. Today, heroin is much more available and much more consistent, which means that the risk of addiction is much higher. Secondly, people have become more aware of the dangers of drug use and the risk of addiction. In the 1920s, there was not much information about drug use, and there was little awareness of the risks of addiction. Today, there is a lot of information about drug use and the risks of addiction, which means that people are more aware of the risks of drug use and are more likely to avoid drug use. Thirdly, society has changed a lot over the past 100 years. In the 1920s, society was much more permissive and there was a lot less stigma associated with drug use. Today, society is much more conservative and there is a lot more stigma associated with drug use.  "
what makes dreaming so much more vivid and memorable than just thinking?,"Dreams are essentially the same as thoughts. The only difference is that the brain is not actively suppressing the thoughts.

What has made our internet faster over the last 20 years?,"The internet is a network of networks. It is made up of many different types of networks, from the one that connects your house to your ISP, to the one that connects your ISP to the ISP that connects your ISP to the ISP that connects the world. All of these networks are made up of switches and routers, which are the things that allow information to be sent from one computer to another. These switches and routers are connected together by cables, which are made up of wires. The speed at which these wires can transmit information is measured in bits per second. In the early days of the internet, the speed at which these wires could transmit information was very slow. In fact, it was so slow that it was hard to imagine that the internet would ever be fast enough to be useful. In the 1990s, the internet was still growing and expanding. It was being built by a lot of different companies, and they were using a lot of different types of cables and switches and routers. There were some companies that were using cables made of copper, which is a very good conductor of electricity. These cables were very fast, and they were able to transmit a lot of information very quickly.  "
How much stress does something like driving put on the brain,"Driving is a complex task that requires the coordination of multiple cognitive and physical processes. There are multiple sources of stress when driving, including the stress of driving itself, the stress of the other drivers on the road, and the stress of the environment (such as traffic lights, road conditions, and weather). The stress of driving is similar to the stress of flying, which is why pilots are at a higher risk of depression and suicide than other professions. The stress of driving is not limited to the act of driving itself, but also to the driving environment. For example, traffic lights and road conditions can be stressful for drivers, and the stress of driving can be exacerbated by the stress of other drivers on the road. The stress of driving is also affected by the individual driver, including their personality, level of anxiety, and the level of stress that they are under. It is difficult to measure the stress of driving, but there is evidence that it can have a significant impact on the brain. A study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that driving is a significant source of stress for drivers, and that driving can lead to increased levels of cortisol (a hormone that is released in response to stress) and decreased levels of serotonin (a neurotransmitter that is involved in regulating mood).

How come things like turn signals and windshield wipers initially seem like they'll align with a beat of a song but then steadily fall off pace? Is there a certain time signature that can consistently match these items?,"]( URL_0 )

Generally the answer is no, there is no specific time signature that matches them. The reason you see this phenomenon is because we are used to hearing music at a steady beat, and we expect things to be in sync with that. But, that's not how the brain works. The brain doesn't process music in time signatures, it processes it in terms of beats per minute. So, it's not a matter of the turn signals and windshield wipers being out of sync, it's that they are out of sync with the beat of the music. When you're listening to music, the brain is processing the beats per minute, and then comparing that to the beats per minute of the turn signals and windshield wipers. If the brain is expecting the turn signals and windshield wipers to be on the beat, but they're not, it will feel off. The brain will start to notice this, and it will start to feel like the turn signals and windshield wipers are off beat. The brain will then try to adjust, but it will keep getting off beat. This is why you see things like turn signals and windshield wipers seem to start off in sync, but then fall off.  "
"Why is absolute zero only 0 kelvin but absolute hot around ~1,4*10^32 kelvin?","Absolute zero is defined as 0 Kelvin. Absolute hot is defined as 1,4 x 10^32 Kelvin. If you want to get into the details of Kelvin, then it is a temperature scale where the freezing point of water is defined as 0 Kelvin and the boiling point of water is defined as 100 Kelvin. So, absolute zero is 0 Kelvin, which is 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Absolute hot is 1,4 x 10^32 Kelvin, which is 1,4 x 10^32 degrees Celsius or 2,1 x 10^32 degrees Fahrenheit. I don't know why you're asking this question, but I'm going to take it as a challenge. I'll give you a really long answer. You can't measure temperature to absolute zero because you can't get any closer to absolute zero than 0 Kelvin. 0 Kelvin is the temperature at which all matter would have zero entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorder. In order to get closer to absolute zero, you would have to reduce the entropy of your system. To do this, you would have to remove all the randomness from the system.  "
"What causes the feeling of impending doom in a medical context, and why is it regarded as a reliable indicator of a patient's condition?"," tl;dr - The feeling of impending doom is caused by the release of stress hormones, which is a normal response to stress. However, in some cases, the release of these hormones can be a sign of a serious condition, such as sepsis. Impending doom is a feeling of fear that is usually associated with the possibility of death. This feeling is caused by the release of stress hormones, which are released in response to stress. The release of these hormones causes the release of chemicals that can cause a feeling of fear, anxiety, and panic. This is a normal response to stress, and it is usually not a sign of a serious condition. However, in some cases, the release of these hormones can be a sign of a serious condition, such as sepsis. Sepsis is a serious infection that can cause inflammation throughout the body, and can lead to organ failure and death. It is usually caused by bacteria that enter the body through an open wound or a cut in the skin. In some cases, sepsis can be caused by bacteria that enter the body through the lungs, such as pneumonia. Sepsis can cause a feeling of impending doom because the body's response to the infection can cause a feeling of fear and panic.  "

Why exactly does rubbing your tongue on another person's tongue (a.k.a. making out or French kiss) feel so good?,"It's not really clear why. There are a few theories. One is that it has to do with the way the tongue and the brain work together. When you're kissing, your tongue is in contact with the person you're kissing, and your brain is receiving a lot of sensory information. The brain is really good at learning from the sensory information it receives, so it's possible that the brain is learning to associate the sensation of kissing with feelings of pleasure. Another theory is that it's just a result of the fact that we're biologically wired to reproduce. Kissing is a way of signaling to the other person that you're interested in them, and it's possible that the pleasure you feel from kissing is a result of the fact that your brain is telling you that you're interested in the person you're kissing. It's also possible that it has to do with the way that the brain processes touch and pleasure. When you're kissing, you're touching the person you're kissing, and that can be pleasurable. The way that the brain processes touch and pleasure is pretty complex, so it's possible that there are lots of different factors that are involved."

"How can Newtonian physics be technically ""wrong"" , but still mathematically explain many natural processes?","Newtonian physics is a model that works well for many things, but it's not a perfect model. Newtonian physics is a mathematical model of how the universe works, and it's very good at explaining things that happen in the everyday world. However, it doesn't account for things that happen at very small scales, or very fast speeds, or very big speeds. So, while Newtonian physics is a very good model for most things, it's not a perfect model. Newtonian physics works well for most things that we see in our everyday lives, but it doesn't account for things that happen at very small scales or very fast speeds. For example, Newtonian physics can't account for the behavior of subatomic particles.   that Newtonian physics uses is very good at predicting the behavior of things that happen in our everyday world, but it's not good at predicting the behavior of things that happen at very small scales. For example, Newtonian physics predicts that a baseball will move in a straight line when you throw it, but it doesn't predict the behavior of an electron. So, Newtonian physics is a very good model for many things, but it's not a perfect model. Newtonian physics is a model, a way of understanding the world. It's not a description of the world itself, but a way of understanding it.  "

How did we determine the order of operations in mathematics?,"The order of operations was developed by a group of mathematicians in the 18th century to provide a standard way of evaluating mathematical expressions. The order of operations is a set of rules that dictate how to perform mathematical operations in a particular order. The acronym PEMDAS is often used to remember the order of operations. The acronym PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. In other words, when evaluating an expression, you first perform any operations inside parentheses, then any operations inside exponents, then any multiplication or division, and finally any addition or subtraction. The order of operations was developed to help mathematicians and students avoid confusion when evaluating expressions. For example, consider the expression 3 + 4 x 5 - 2 / 3. Without a standard order of operations, there could be many different ways to evaluate this expression. With PEMDAS, however, the expression can be evaluated as follows: 3 + 4 x 5 - 2 / 3 = 3 + 20 - 6 = 23. This is just one example of how the order of operations can help to avoid confusion. The order of operations is used in many different areas of mathematics, including algebra, calculus, and geometry.  "

"Why does YouTube, a website which such high account security, have so many spam bots while Reddit, a website that seems to have low account security, has almost none?","I think this is a case of correlation vs causation. The fact that YouTube has a lot of spam bots does not necessarily mean that YouTube has low account security. It may be that the spam bots are just very good at exploiting vulnerabilities in the system. If you look at the spam bots on YouTube, they're actually not very sophisticated. They're just posting links to sites that have nothing to do with the content of the video, and in most cases the link is just a clickbait-style headline.

How are there people who cant dream?,"There are a number of disorders that affect the ability to dream. One of the most well-known is RBD, which is a disorder that causes the muscles of the body to act out during sleep. It is often seen in people with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Some people with RBD also experience hallucinations, which is another disorder that affects the brain’s ability to interpret sensory information. There are also people who are born without the ability to dream. One such condition is called Fugue State, which is a rare disorder that can occur when a person experiences a severe trauma. People who experience Fugue State often have no memory of their past and are unable to form new memories. Some people who have Fugue State also experience dissociative identity disorder, which is a disorder that causes a person to experience multiple personalities. There are also some medications that can cause a person to stop dreaming. For example, some antidepressants and antipsychotics can cause a person to experience a condition called a “sleep disorder.” This can include difficulty sleeping or a lack of sleep, as well as difficulty dreaming.

The UK miner strikes,"of 1984-85 were a series of strikes by coal miners in the United Kingdom. Tensions had been building in the industry for several years, as coal miners had seen their wages frozen for years, while the cost of living continued to rise. In 1983, the UK government announced that coal mining subsidies would be cut, and the industry would be privatized. The miners' union, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), responded by calling for a strike in the summer of 1983. The strike was largely successful, but it was only a temporary victory. In 1984, the government announced that coal mining would be privatized, and the NUM called for another strike. This strike was less successful, but it did help to raise public awareness of the plight of coal miners.   called for a third strike, which was largely unsuccessful.

Depression is often caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and it is also a common symptom of other mental health conditions. There are different types of depression, and they can be caused by different things. The most common is called major depressive disorder, and it is a chemical imbalance in the brain. There is a chemical called serotonin, and sometimes this chemical can be out of balance. This can be treated with medication, but the treatment doesn't always work, and some people can't take it because it can have bad side effects. There is also a condition called bipolar disorder, which is a mood disorder. It can be treated with medication, but it's hard to get rid of it. There are also different types of depression that are caused by different things, like post-traumatic stress disorder, which is caused by trauma, and dysthymia, which is a low-grade depression that can last for years. It's hard to get rid of depression because of the different types of depression and the different causes.  "
What is the difference between methamphetamine and amphetamine salts (Adderall)? What makes amphetamine salts so much safer/less addictive?," ""Amphetamine salts"" refers to a mixture of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, which are both stimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. They work by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, which help regulate attention and impulse control. However, they are highly addictive and can cause negative side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and high blood pressure. Methamphetamine, on the other hand, is a highly addictive and dangerous drug that is chemically similar to amphetamine salts but is more potent and longer-lasting. It is often used as a recreational drug, but it can cause negative side effects such as paranoia, hallucinations, and psychosis. It is also highly addictive and can cause long-term damage to the brain."
"If there were a mirror in deep space (light years away), would we see ourselves in the past if we looked into it?","There's a couple of things that go on here. First, the mirror would be in a different location in space than we are. If we were to look at the mirror, we'd be looking at it from our current location. If we were to travel to the mirror, we'd be moving through time as well as space. If we were to travel to the mirror, we'd be looking at the mirror from the mirror's current location. So, if we were to travel to the mirror, we'd be looking at ourselves from the past. However, we'd also be looking at ourselves from the mirror's perspective, so we'd be seeing ourselves in the mirror.   a movie. If you're watching a movie, you're looking at the movie from the movie's perspective. But, you're also looking at the movie from your perspective.

What gas is inside blisters and how does it get there?,"Your skin is made of layers of cells that are all connected together. When you get burned, the layers of cells get damaged and some of the cells get pushed out of place. This creates a pocket of fluid that is trapped between the cells. This is called a blister. The fluid is called serum, and it is made of water, proteins, and salts. The skin is also made of a special layer called the epidermis, which is made of dead cells that protect the living cells underneath. When you get burned, the dead skin cells die and flake off. This is why your skin peels after you get burned. The fluid that is trapped in the blister is called serum, and it is made of water, proteins, and salts.

What's a single-nucleotide polymorphism?,"A single nucleotide polymorphism is a difference in one of the nucleotides that make up our DNA. Microsatellites are a group of nucleotides that are repeated many times. A single nucleotide polymorphism is a single difference in the DNA sequence. A microsatellite is a sequence of a few nucleotides that is repeated. They are often used to identify genetic differences between individuals, and they are used in forensic science to identify the source of a DNA sample."
why do many major league player's sports contracts always include a deferred annuity portion?,"The short answer is that it’s a way for the player to get a guaranteed income in retirement. It’s not the only way, but it’s a good way. The long answer is that it’s a way to make the contract more attractive to the team. The team is essentially paying the player a guaranteed income in retirement. The team can then use that money to help fund the guaranteed income of the other players on the team. The team also gets to use the money to help fund the guaranteed income of its coaches and other staff. This helps the team to attract and retain top talent, which helps the team to win games, which helps the team to sell tickets, which helps the team to make money. The team can also use the money to help fund the guaranteed income of its owners and shareholders. This helps the team to attract and retain top owners and shareholders, which helps the team to win games, which helps the team to sell tickets, which helps the team to make money."

"Why does the United States sell things like Milk and Water in gallons, but Soda in liters?","Liters are a metric unit of measurement. Metric is a system of measurement that is based on powers of ten. For example, a meter is ten times longer than a centimeter, and a gram is a thousandth of a kilogram. A liter is a thousandth of a cubic meter. The United States has a different system of measurement, called the Imperial system. It's based on powers of twelve, and is used in the UK. For example, a meter is twelve times longer than a foot, and a gram is a twelfth of a pound. The US system of measurement is based on the British system, which was developed in the 14th century. The US system of measurement is also used in Canada, Australia, and a few other countries. It's called the Imperial system because it was used by the British Empire, which was the dominant world power in the 17th through 19th centuries. The US system is based on the British system, but it has been modified to be more convenient for American use. For example, the US system uses feet and inches for length, while the British system uses meters. The US system also uses Fahrenheit for temperature, while the British system uses Celsius. In general, the US system is more convenient for American use, while the British system is more convenient for British use.  "
How does our body absorb creams? Which parts of our skin do they go to?,"The skin is made of layers of cells. The outermost layer is the epidermis, which is the layer that we can see. The epidermis is made up of dead cells, and it is very thin, so that it can be easily damaged. Underneath the epidermis is the dermis, which is the second layer of skin. The dermis is made up of living cells. The dermis is where the sweat glands are located, and where the blood vessels are located. The dermis is also where the nerve endings are located, and where the sensation of touch is felt. The epidermis and the dermis are separated by a layer of fat called the subcutaneous tissue. The subcutaneous tissue is made up of fat cells, and it is located underneath the dermis. The subcutaneous tissue helps to protect the skin from damage. The skin is very thin, and it is not very strong. It is very easy to damage the skin. The skin is very sensitive, and it is very sensitive to temperature.   skin is exposed to extreme temperatures, it will hurt. The skin is also very sensitive to touch.   skin is touched, it will feel the touch. The skin is very sensitive to pressure.   skin is pressed, it will feel the pressure. The skin is very sensitive to light.  "
How much power does the computer need to fully emulate human's brain?,"It's a very complex question, and one that is difficult to answer. It's difficult to even say how much power a human brain uses. The answer is somewhere between 100 and 200 watts. However, that doesn't tell us how much power it would take to emulate a human brain. The brain is made up of many different parts, including the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, the brainstem, and the basal ganglia. It's difficult to say how much power it would take to emulate each of these parts. It's also difficult to say how much power it would take to connect all of these parts together. This is because the brain is very complex and has many different connections. It's also difficult to say how much power it would take to add in things like the spinal cord, the peripheral nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, and the enteric nervous system. This is because these are all different parts of the brain, and it's difficult to say how much power it would take to emulate them. It's also difficult to say how much power it would take to emulate the brain's ability to change and adapt.  "
How your body reject all food and water when hungover knowing it's hungry and dehydrated?," Sounds like you're experiencing the effects of alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it causes your body to lose water. Alcohol also suppresses your appetite and causes nausea. Alcohol also affects your stomach and digestive system, which can cause vomiting."
"when hyperinflation occurs, are people with fixed interest loans or fixed interest mortgages able to pay off their debt without any issues?","It depends. If the inflation rate is 100%, then you'd need 100% more money to pay off your debt. But if you have a fixed interest rate, then the interest rate is fixed in money terms, so your debt will increase in real terms, but not by 100%. So, if you have a fixed interest rate, then you'll be able to pay off your debt in real terms, but not necessarily in nominal terms. It depends on the specifics of your loan/mortgage. If you have a fixed interest rate loan or mortgage, then the interest rate is fixed in terms of money. So if inflation goes up by 100%, then the interest rate will go up by 100%, so you will pay off your debt in the same amount of money. However, the value of the money will be less, so you will have to earn more to pay off the same amount of debt. If you have a fixed interest rate, then you will be able to pay off your debt in real terms, but not necessarily in nominal terms. If you have a variable interest rate, then your interest rate will increase in real terms, so you will have to earn more to pay off the same amount of debt.  "
Why did early pistol and musket designs have such unergonomic looking grips?," Grips were originally made from wood and were carved into the shape of a finger, to fit comfortably in the hand. This made them more comfortable to use and shoot. As firearms became more common, people became more skilled at shooting them. The grips became less important to shooters and more important to collectors. The grips were made more ornamental, with engravings, carvings, and decorations. As the grips became more decorative, they became less comfortable to shoot. The grips became less ergonomic and more decorative. They were made with more ornamental designs and less functional designs. The grips were made more decorative, with engravings, carvings, and decorations.

Why are conifers usually triangular while deciduous trees are usually 'circular' in profile?,"Conifers are usually triangular in profile because the needles are held in a spiral pattern on the branch. This makes them look triangular. Deciduous trees are usually circular in profile because their leaves are held on the branch in a flat, two-dimensional plane. This makes them look circular. As for why conifers have spiral needles, that is because they evolved in a more temperate climate, where they would have had to fight for space on the branch. The spiral pattern of needles allows them to cover more surface area on the branch, giving them an advantage over other plants."
"Why is it that we think of mirrors as being silver colored, even though they reflect the exact colors of objects around them?","It's because silver is a color that we are used to seeing in our everyday lives. We're used to seeing silver in jewelry, silverware, and silver-colored metals. We are also used to seeing it in the moon and in the sky, and we're used to seeing it in the sun. So when we look at a mirror, we see ourselves in a world that we are used to seeing silver in. This is why we think of mirrors as being silver-colored."
Before modern counterfeit measures how could people tell if their currency was counterfeit?,"( URL_0 ) The paper used to make the money is a bit different than regular paper. It has a watermark that can be seen under a light source. It also has a security thread that can be seen with a light source. The thread is made of a very thin metal thread that is embedded in the paper. If you look closely at the paper, you can see a very thin line that is embedded in the paper. This is the security thread. If you hold it up to the light, you can see that it glows. If you hold the note up to a light source, you can see a watermark. This is a very thin image of a person that is embedded in the paper. It is hard to see with the naked eye, but if you hold the note up to the light, you can see it. If you look closely at the bill, you can see a very small image of a person that is embedded in the paper. This is the watermark.

Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and why it is an argument against the Theory of Everything,"(ToE) and not just the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. tl;dr: Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem shows that any formal system (including math) that can describe itself cannot be consistent. The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics describes itself as a mathematical system. Therefore, it cannot be consistent. The argument against the Theory of Everything (ToE) is that it is an attempt to describe the entirety of existence as a single formal system. If the ToE is consistent, then Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem implies that it cannot describe itself. Therefore, the ToE is inconsistent and cannot be a ToE."

"Both the sun and moon appear flat, with no cues that one is further away than the other. What is the maximum distance that variations in depth can be perceived at, and why?","The maximum distance at which we can see depth cues is called the ""depth of focus"". This is the distance at which the eye can see objects as being in focus, and is dependent on the lighting conditions, the size of the objects, and the quality of the lenses of the eye. It is possible to see depth cues up to 20-30 feet away, but only if the lighting conditions are ideal. In low light conditions, the depth of focus is much closer, and it is difficult to see depth cues at all."
Both of my Parents are type O blood type. I am AB+ how is that possible?,"I'm AB+, and my parents are both O+. There are 4 blood types: A, B, AB, and O.

If you are A+, B+, AB+, or O+, then you are the same as both of your parents. If you are A-, B-, AB-, or O-, then you are different from both of your parents."
Why is ice less dense than water even though most solids are more dense than their liquid forms?,"The reason is that water is an unusual molecule. It has a very low boiling point (100 degrees C) and a very high melting point (0 degrees C). This means that it has a very high surface tension and very strong hydrogen bonding between the water molecules. This makes water very hard to compress. When you compress water, the hydrogen bonds are forced apart and the water molecules are stretched out. This makes the water less dense. Ice is less dense than water because it has a different structure. It has a crystalline structure that is held together by hydrogen bonds. This is the same structure as the ice that you see in the freezer, but the water in the freezer is in a liquid state. When you freeze water, the molecules are forced together in a crystalline structure and the water becomes less dense."
How do people in war zones have access to Internet?,"Many people in war zones have access to the internet through mobile phones. In some cases, they are able to use the internet on their phones via satellite, but in other cases, they use the internet on their phones via cell towers. This is the case in places like Afghanistan. There are cell towers that are not run by the government, but are run by private companies. These towers are used to provide cell phone service to people in the country. In other cases, people use the internet on their phones through a process called ""mesh networking."" This is when a group of people are all connected to the internet, and their phones are all connected to each other. This allows them to send and receive data. In war zones, this is often done through the use of a small, portable computer that is connected to the internet via a cell phone or satellite. This computer is then connected to other computers, and data is sent back and forth between them. This allows people in war zones to access the internet, even if they do not have electricity."

Why are nuclear bombs detonated in the air instead of on impact?,"The explosion is a result of the nuclear reaction. The reaction itself happens in a tiny, tiny area. The reaction creates a huge amount of energy in a very small area. The energy is then radiated outward. The explosion is a result of the energy being radiated outward and expanding. The explosion is not a result of the reaction itself. The explosion is a result of the energy being radiated outward. The reaction itself is contained."

How are the quantity of standard SI units determined?,"I'm a physicist, so I'll give you the physics answer. & #x200B; In the early days of physics, the meter was defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. This was a very rough estimate, and it varied depending on the wavelength of light. In 1960, the meter was redefined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. This is the modern definition of the meter.   meter is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). The meter is the unit of length used for all other units of length.   other base units are the kilogram (the unit of mass), the second (the unit of time), the ampere (the unit of electric current), the Kelvin (the unit of temperature), the candela (the unit of luminous intensity), the mole (the unit of amount of substance), the candela (the unit of luminous intensity), and the sievert (the unit of radiation exposure).  "
Is silver a real color or just an optical property of certain materials?,"Real colors are colors that are perceived by our eyes. Optical properties are the colors we see because of the way light interacts with the material. Real colors are what you see when you look at something, optical properties are what you see because of how light behaves when it interacts with the material. Optical properties are not colors in the classical sense, they are the way that light interacts with the material. For example, gold is a real color, it's a certain wavelength of light that is reflected. Silver is an optical property, it's the way that light reflects off of the surface, it's not a color at all. Real colors are colors that you can see with your eyes. Optical properties are the colors that you see due to how light behaves when it interacts with the material. For example, gold is a real color, but it is also an optical property. It reflects light in a certain way, which is why it looks yellowish. Silver is an optical property, but it is not a real color. It is not a color that you can see with your eyes."
How are new organs still being discovered? Shouldn't they have all been found with modern technology/direct surgical 'exploration'?,"The human body is a very complex machine and we still have a lot to learn about it. There are a lot of organs that we don't know exist or how they work. The liver is a good example. We used to think it was just a filter for the blood, but now we know it has a lot of other functions, like producing bile to digest food and a lot of other things. There are also a lot of organs that are very hard to see, like the liver, so we can't just look at the body and see what's there. We have to use special techniques, like ultrasound, or even surgery, to see what's going on inside."
How can airport scanners see through leather but not through skin?," Pretend I am a 5 year old. Thanks! 😊 The scanner works by sending out a lot of little waves. These waves are like a special kind of light. When they hit something, they bounce off. This bouncing is how the scanner knows what is going on. The waves are very good at hitting leather, but they don't hit skin very well. So it's hard for the scanner to see through skin. But the scanner can see through leather. This is because leather is like a big piece of cloth. Cloth is not very good at stopping the special light waves from hitting it. So the scanner can see right through leather."
How do the military counts and confirms kills?,"I work in the military. We use a variety of methods to confirm kills. There are two primary methods. One is the use of surveillance cameras. We have cameras in place that can see the battlefield. These cameras can confirm that a person has been killed. The other method is eyewitness accounts. We have soldiers that are trained to confirm that a person is dead. They will then report the kill to us. We also have a system that tracks the number of kills. If a soldier reports a kill, we use that data to track the number of kills. We also use data from surveillance cameras to track the number of kills. We also use data from other sources. We have a system that tracks the number of people that are killed. This system is used to confirm that a person is dead.   number of people that are killed.

Does my stomach acid pass into the rest of my digestive tract when food leaves my stomach?,"Nope. The stomach acid is there to break down the food in your stomach, and it will kill bacteria that may be in your food. The stomach acid is not very strong, and the stomach lining is able to handle the acid. The stomach acid is produced by the stomach lining, and it will only be produced in the stomach. Your stomach is a muscular bag, and it contracts to move food in and out of the stomach. The stomach acid is only in the stomach when you are eating, and it will only be there for as long as you are eating. Once you are done eating, the stomach will relax and the stomach acid will move out of the stomach."
Why does fuel not ignite in cars?,"It's a combination of the fuel being too low in volatile compounds and the air being too high in non-volatile compounds. The fuel is designed to have a high enough energy density to be able to burn in the engine, but it's also designed to be stable enough to not ignite in the engine. The air is designed to be mostly oxygen, which is the most volatile compound that can be used to support combustion, but the air is also designed to be mostly nitrogen and other non-volatile compounds, which do not support combustion. So the fuel and air are designed to be mixed in a way that the fuel can ignite, but the air is not able to ignite."
How is it that we are able to remember a songs lyrics even when we haven't heard the song in a while?,"Your body has a clock, and it's set to your circadian rhythm, which is your sleep cycle. It tells you when you need to eat, when you need to sleep, and when you need to wake up. You also have a hunger/fullness sensor, which tells you when you're hungry, and when you're full. You also have a memory of when you ate last, and how much you ate."
Why does nicotine enhance the realism of dreams? What are some other things that may have this effect?,"norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter that is released by the brain in response to stress. In addition to the physiological effects of stress, norepinephrine is also involved in the regulation of dreaming. The release of norepinephrine in the brain during sleep is thought to enhance the vividness and intensity of dreams."
Why do we expect technologically advanced extraterrestrial life to broadcast radio signals into space?,"Because it's the most effective way of communicating over vast distances. We use radio waves because they are easy to generate, and they can travel through space without being absorbed or reflected. We know that other civilizations will be able to detect them. We also know that they will be able to detect our radio signals. So, we broadcast radio signals because we know that other civilizations can detect them."

"The saying ""feed a cold, starve a fever"". Just an old wise tale or is it accurate? If so what is happening physically?","I don't have any scientific evidence to back it up, but I've noticed that when I eat less, I get sick less often. When I eat more, I get sick more often. I'm not a scientist, but I'm guessing that when you eat less, your body has to work harder to digest the food, which uses up more energy. If your body doesn't have enough energy, it's going to focus on things like fighting off illness instead of digesting food. If you eat more, you're giving your body more energy to focus on digestion, which means it has less energy to fight off illness. I'm not saying this is a proven fact or anything, but it's just something I've noticed in my own life."

"Why is processed ""regular"" pasta cheaper than whole grain?","Whole grain is a more expensive product to produce because it has a lower yield per hectare. Whole grain is a more nutritious product, so it has a higher demand, but it's also a more expensive product. The cost of producing whole grain is higher because the grain needs to be processed and ground to make it edible. It's also a more expensive product to ship because it's heavier and takes up more space. Whole grain is more expensive because it's healthier. It has more fiber, more nutrients, and more vitamins. It's also more expensive to produce because it's harder to produce. It's harder to harvest and it's harder to grind into flour. It's also more expensive to ship. It's heavier and takes up more space.

Why are economic ideas called theories?,"There are many reasons why we call economic ideas ""theories."" Here are a few. 1. The term ""theories"" is used in many fields, and it simply means a set of ideas about how something works. It doesn't have to be true or accurate. In fact, many of the theories we use in economics are often considered to be ""micro-economic models"" or ""macro-economic models."" That means they are simplified versions of reality that help us understand how things work, but they are not necessarily true. 2. In the case of economics, we don't have a way to prove or disprove our ideas. We can't conduct experiments to see if they are true, and we can't observe the world around us to see if they are true. So, we rely on mathematical models to test our ideas. Mathematical models are used to make predictions about what will happen in the future if we do this or that. If our predictions are correct, then we know that our ideas are true. But if our predictions are incorrect, then we know that our ideas are false. 3. Economics is a social science. That means that it deals with people and their behavior. People are complicated and unpredictable.  "
Why do we cry? What is the connection of tears coming out of our eyes with sadness or even happiness.,"> What is the connection of tears coming out of our eyes with sadness or even happiness. Tears are a defense mechanism to protect the eyes from infection. They are produced by the lacrimal gland, which is located under the eyebrow bone, and the tears drain into the nasolacrimal duct, which empties into the back of the nose. Tears contain enzymes and other chemicals that help to fight off infection, as well as mucus, which helps to lubricate the eye. The lacrimal gland is controlled by the hypothalamus, which is a part of the brain that controls many of our body's functions, including the production of tears. The hypothalamus is connected to the limbic system, which is a part of the brain that controls our emotions, including sadness and happiness. Tears are produced in response to emotional stimuli, including sadness and happiness. Tears are produced in response to emotional stimuli, including sadness and happiness. The hypothalamus can detect emotional stimuli, and can produce tears in response. The hypothalamus can also detect physical stimuli, such as pain, and can produce tears in response.  "

"Why do some people sleep like rocks, while others wake up at the sound of a pin drop?","The reason we sleep is because our bodies need to rest and recharge. The amount of sleep we need varies from person to person, but generally, most people need around 7-9 hours of sleep per night. If we don't get enough sleep, we can get sleepy during the day and have trouble concentrating. If we get too much sleep, we can feel groggy and tired. There is no ""right"" amount of sleep that we all need. The amount of sleep we need is different for each person. Some people need more sleep than others. Some people can sleep for 10 hours and still feel tired. Others can sleep for 5 hours and feel refreshed.   don't know why some people need more sleep than others, but it probably has something to do with genetics. Sleep is very important for our bodies. While we sleep, our bodies work on keeping us healthy. They do things like repairing our bodies, growing new cells, and fighting off infections. If we don't get enough sleep, we can become sick more easily. If we don't get enough sleep, we can also feel tired and grumpy. If we don't get enough sleep, we can also have trouble concentrating.

Does the placebo effect prove that our minds have a lot more power than we can directly utilize?,"Not necessarily. The placebo effect is not really a proof of anything, it's just a phenomenon that we've observed. The way we observe it is by comparing the results of a treatment (whether it be a real treatment or a fake one) to the results of no treatment. The results of no treatment are usually considered the baseline, and then we compare the results of the treatment to that baseline.   the results of the treatment are significantly better than the baseline, then we consider that a positive result. However, this is not necessarily a proof of anything, it's just a way of comparing the results of different treatments. The placebo effect is a bit of a tricky thing to measure, because the results of no treatment are also not a baseline.   you are a healthy person, then the results of no treatment are also not a baseline. You are probably going to get better on your own. The placebo effect is just a way of measuring how much better you are going to get when you are taking a treatment. So, if you are sick and you take a treatment, then the results of the treatment are compared to the results of no treatment, and the results of the treatment are better than the results of no treatment, then you can say that the treatment is effective. But this is not necessarily a proof of anything, because the results of no treatment are not a baseline.  "
Why does a 2 hour movie take a year to make when a high quality TV show can make 45 minute ones every week.,"I have no idea how long it takes to make a TV show, but I do know that most movies take a long time to make. Movies are a lot more complex than TV shows. There are a lot more people involved in making a movie, and it has to be perfect. In order to get it perfect, it takes a lot of time. In addition, movies have to be filmed in a specific order. This means that everything that comes before a scene has to be filmed before that scene is filmed. This means that it takes a long time to get everything filmed. In contrast, TV shows are filmed in a more relaxed manner. They are filmed in front of a live audience, and they don't have to worry about being perfect. This means that it takes less time to make a TV show than it does to make a movie."

The difference between hacking and guessing a password,"is the amount of information you have. (Also, there are lots of different ways to do things, but here’s one of the most common ways). First, let’s say you want to guess the password for a computer. You don’t know the password, so you’re guessing. You can guess a letter, and you’re 1/26th of the way to guessing the password, because there are 26 letters in the alphabet. (The number of letters in the alphabet is 26). If you guess another letter, you’re 1/52nd of the way to guessing the password. You can keep guessing letters until you guess the right one. If you guess 26 letters, you’ll guess the password. If you guess 52 letters, you’ll guess the password. If you guess 100 letters, you’ll guess the password. But you’ll also use up all the guesses you have. If you want to guess 100 passwords, you’ll use up all 100 guesses. If you want to guess 1000 passwords, you’ll use up all 1000 guesses. And so on. Now, let’s say you want to hack into a computer. You have a way of getting into the computer, and you can see what’s inside.  "
Why do the web addresses for subreddits need an /r/ before them?," In the early days of the internet, the address space was divided into a hierarchy of domains (e.g. com, org, net) and subdomains (e.g. example.com, example.org, example.net). The subdomains were used to provide a way to refer to a subdomain of a domain. For example, the subdomain ""www"" was used to refer to the website of a domain. The domain ""example"" could have a subdomain ""www"" which would be used to refer to the website of example.com. In the case of Reddit, the domain ""reddit"" was used to refer to the website of reddit.com. Subreddits were created using subdomains of the domain ""reddit"". The subdomain ""r/"", followed by the name of the subreddit, was used to refer to the subreddit. For example, r/IAmA was used to refer to the subreddit ""IAmA"". In 2011, Reddit changed the way subreddits were referred to. Instead of using the subdomain ""r/"", followed by the name of the subreddit, the subreddit name was used as the domain. For example, IAmA became iama.reddit.com.  "

It is usually the calendar year, but it can be any 12 months period. The fiscal year is a calendar year, it's the period of time in which the government's budget is created and it's the period of time in which the government's spending is tracked. It's usually the calendar year, but it can be any 12 months period. The reason we have a fiscal year is to make it easier for the government to track how much money it's spending, and to make it easier for the government to compare how much money it's spending in different years. For example, the government may decide that it needs to spend more money on defense this year than last year, so it will make sure to have a budget that reflects that. The fiscal year is also important because it's the period of time in which the government's taxes are collected. The government may decide that it needs to collect more money in taxes this year than last year, so it will make sure to have a budget that reflects that."

This is hotter than the Sun's surface, which is about 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees Fahrenheit)."
How do we get headaches if the brain has no pain receptor?,"The brain does have pain receptors, and they are found in the meninges, the thin membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The meninges contain nerve endings, which are specialized sensory receptors that detect pressure and other sensations. When the meninges are stretched or compressed, the nerve endings detect the pressure and transmit it to the brain as pain. The meninges are found all around the brain, and are particularly thick around the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsible for processing sensory information. The meninges are also found around the spinal cord, which is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the rest of the body to the brain."
Why would a computer replace a simple character (') into a complicated series of nonsense ( & #39;) when copying and pasting certain text?," The reason is that the computer is trying to be helpful. It thinks that you might be trying to copy a file with the same name as the text, and so it wants to make sure that you don't accidentally replace the file with the text. It does this by replacing the file with a file that contains the text, and then replacing the file with the original file. This way, you can't accidentally delete the original file, and you can still use the file that contains the text."
What is the circle of fifths and how do you read it?,"The circle of fifths is a diagram showing the relationships between the different keys on a piano. The circle is divided into 12 equal sections, each of which corresponds to a different key. The first section is C, the second is C# (or Db), the third is D, and so on. The pattern continues clockwise around the circle, with each subsequent section being an octave higher than the previous one. The circle of fifths is useful for understanding the relationships between different keys, and for understanding the chords that are available in each key. For example, if you start at C, you can see that the chords available in C are C, F, G, Am, Em, and Dm. If you move one step clockwise to D, you can see that the chords available are D, G, Am, F, Em, and Cm.  , you can see that the chords available in E are E, G, Am, Bm, F, C, and Dm.  , you can see that the chords available in F are F, G, Am, Bm, C, D, and Em.  , you can see that the chords available in G are G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, and F.

Why is there an enzyme in the human body that breaks down methanol into formaldehyde? How does this enzyme exist in the first place?,"Methanol is produced in the body from the breakdown of amino acids and other compounds. It is then metabolized to formaldehyde by the enzyme methanol oxidase. The enzyme is produced in the liver and kidneys, and is responsible for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. The enzyme is present in the body because the body needs a mechanism to break down methanol. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but it is also a natural compound that occurs in the body. Methanol is a byproduct of alcohol metabolism, and it is also present in many fruits and vegetables. It is broken down by the liver into formaldehyde, which is then broken down further into carbon dioxide and water. The liver also converts methanol to formaldehyde in the presence of oxygen. The liver can also convert methanol to formaldehyde in the absence of oxygen, but this process is less efficient and produces more free radicals. The liver is able to break down methanol into formaldehyde because of an enzyme called methanol oxidase.  "

Why can a psychological condition/state (like stress) cause physiological effects?,"In a way, our mind and body are connected. When we think, our brain sends electrical signals to different parts of our body, and when we feel, our brain receives signals from different parts of our body. This is why we can feel pain, hunger, happiness, or any other emotion. It is also why we can get headaches, stomachaches, or a cold when we are stressed. The stress response is a mechanism that has evolved to help us respond to threats. When we feel threatened, our body prepares to fight or run away. Our heart beats faster, our muscles become tense, our senses become more acute, and we become more alert. In the wild, these changes help us survive. But when we are stressed in a modern world, these changes can be harmful. For example, when we are stressed, our body produces chemicals that increase blood pressure and heart rate. This can lead to a heart attack or a stroke. Also, when we are stressed, our body produces chemicals that suppress our immune system. This can lead to illnesses like the flu or a cold.   can also produce chemicals that affect our mood. For example, when we are stressed, our body produces chemicals that can make us feel sad or irritable.  "
how did humans survive the ice age?,"Ice ages are periods of time where the Earth is covered in ice, and it can last for thousands of years. The most recent ice age, the Pleistocene, lasted from 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago. The first ice age was about 2.8 million years ago, and it lasted for 400,000 years. The ice age ended about 15,000 years ago, and it’s believed that humans and other animals were able to survive the cold temperatures and harsh conditions because of the availability of food. Humans were able to survive the ice ages because of the availability of food. The ice ages were times of great cold, but also of great abundance. The cold meant that the oceans were able to freeze, and the ice that formed on the seas was rich in nutrients. This meant that the fish that lived in the oceans were able to thrive, and they were rich in nutrients. This meant that the humans that lived near the oceans were able to survive. The ice ages also meant that the weather was colder, but it was also wetter.  "
Why do colors combine to make other colors?,"Colors are a combination of light waves. When light is reflected off an object, it hits your eye. Your eye is able to see the color of the light by measuring how long the light wave lasts. Longer wavelengths are perceived as red, shorter wavelengths are perceived as blue, and the middle of the spectrum is perceived as green. When two colors are combined, the light waves are added together. If the light waves are the same wavelength, the color will remain the same. If the light waves are different wavelengths, the color will change. When light waves are combined, they will cancel each other out, creating white.   why light is white, and why the sky is blue. The sky is blue because the light waves are combined, but the blue light is still present. When two colors are combined, the light waves will cancel each other out, creating white.   why the sky is blue. When two colors are combined, the light waves will cancel each other out, creating white.   why the sky is blue.

How does internet speed affect online gaming experience,"
 The internet speed is the amount of data that is transferred between two points in a network in a second. The speed of the internet is measured in bits per second (bps). The higher the speed, the more data can be transferred in a second. For online gaming, speed of the internet is important because the game needs to transfer the data in real time. If the speed is too low, the game will not be able to transfer the data in real time. If the speed is too high, the game will not be able to transfer the data fast enough. For example, if the speed is 56 kbps, it will take 20 seconds to transfer 1000 bytes of data. If the speed is 1000 kbps, it will take 0.001 seconds to transfer 1000 bytes of data. The speed of the internet can be affected by several factors, including the distance between the two points in the network, the amount of data that is being transferred, and the quality of the connection. For example, the speed of the internet will be slower if the distance between the two points is long. The speed of the internet will be faster if the amount of data being transferred is large. The speed of the internet will be slower if the quality of the connection is poor. In addition to the speed of the internet, the quality of the connection is also important for online gaming."

Why does scratching a bug bite feel so amazingly good when I'm obviously damaging my skin?,"- 1. The bug's saliva contains a compound called histamine which is also found in the blood of humans. When the histamine is released into the blood stream, it causes the blood vessels to dilate, which can lead to a feeling of warmth or tingling sensation. - 2. When you scratch the bug bite, you are stimulating the nerve endings in the skin which can release endorphins. This is similar to why we scratch our itches. - 3. The bug's saliva can also cause an allergic reaction, which can release endorphins. - 4. The itching sensation from the bug bite is also caused by a parasite called Sarcoptes scabiei. The parasite causes the mite to burrow under the skin, and causes the skin to become inflamed. The itching sensation is a result of the body's immune response to the inflammation."

Why are American postboxes/mailboxes usually detached from the house itself?," in the UK, the post box is usually attached to the house. In fact, most houses have a mailbox on the front door, and it's actually a legal requirement for houses in the UK to have a postbox.

What's the difference between a quicksave and a normal save in a video game?,"'Quicksave' is a term used in games where you have a limited number of slots for saving your progress. You have to use them wisely, because once you've used them all up, you'll have to start over. This is often used in games with a strong focus on exploration, where you'll be constantly finding new things to do, but you might not always be able to save your progress. In games with this system, 'Quicksave' is a way to save your progress without having to use up one of your limited slots. It's usually a more temporary save, so it's not as safe as a normal save, but it can be useful in situations where you're about to enter a dangerous area, or you're about to do something risky, or you just want to save your progress without having to wait for the next quicksave opportunity. Normal saves are usually the most common way of saving your progress in a game. They're the kind of saves where you can save your progress at any time, and they're usually the safest kind of saves. In games with a normal save system, you'll usually have unlimited slots to save your progress, so you can save whenever you want, and you don't have to worry about running out of slots.  "

Why do essential oils dissolve paint?,"Essential oils are very polar. They have a lot of hydrogen atoms that are easily attracted to the oxygen atoms in water, which makes them soluble in water. They also have a lot of electronegative atoms that repel water, which makes them insoluble in water. The difference in electronegativity between the oxygen atoms in the essential oils and the hydrogen atoms in water is relatively small, so the attraction between the two is relatively weak. This makes the essential oils very soluble in water."

how do airline alliances work,"There are a few different types of alliances. One is the ""hub and spoke"" model, where a major airline operates from a major city and has a bunch of smaller airlines operating out of smaller cities. The smaller airlines operate flights to the major airline's hub, and then the major airline operates flights from the hub. This model is great for connecting people from smaller cities to the major city, but it's not great for people who want to fly from smaller city to smaller city. Another type of alliance is the ""code share"" model, where a major airline operates flights between two cities, but the smaller airline operates flights between the two cities using the major airline's code. This model is great for people who want to fly between smaller cities, but it's not great for people who want to fly between major cities. The final type of alliance is the ""joint venture"" model, where two or more airlines operate flights between two or more cities. This model is great for people who want to fly between major cities, but it's not great for people who want to fly between smaller cities. The way that airline alliances work is that they are basically agreements between airlines to work together. This can include things like sharing flight schedules, sharing airport facilities, and sharing profits.  "
What are each programming language's real-world function?,"You're not talking about the same thing. The name for the country changes depending on the language spoken by the people in that country. Some languages have a lot of words, others have few. Some languages are more common, others are less common. The same applies to the name of the country. The English name for a country is often the most common one, but it may not be the only one. In the US, for example, the country is called ""The United States of America"". In the UK, it's called ""The United States"". In France, it's called ""Les Etats-Unis"". In Germany, it's called ""Die USA"". In Spanish, it's called ""Estados Unidos"". In Portuguese, it's called ""Estados Unidos"". In Italian, it's called ""Stati Uniti"". In Russian, it's called ""Соединенные Штаты Америки"". In Chinese, it's called ""美国"".

Why does starchy food stick so hard onto kitchenware?,"When you cook starchy foods like pasta or rice, they release starches. Starches are very sticky, and they adhere to the surface of the pot and other cooking surfaces. When you cook starchy foods like potatoes, they release starches that are more sticky than the starches from other foods. This is why it is so hard to get the starchy food off the pot or pan."
Why do some people find things like dolls and clowns scary?,]( URL_0 ) > The reason is that we have a natural fear of things that look human. We have an instinct to avoid things that look like they might be dangerous. This is a survival instinct that we have had for a long time. It is the same reason that we are afraid of snakes. It is the same reason that we are afraid of spiders. It is the same reason that we are afraid of heights. We have a fear of things that look human because we are afraid of being hurt.
How does SSL Certificates work exactly?,"SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It's a protocol that allows secure communication between two parties on the internet. In other words, it's a way for your browser to know that you're communicating with the correct server and that the information you're sending is private. SSL works by using a handshake. You've probably seen this happen when you visit a secure website. The browser sends a request to the server and the server responds with an SSL certificate. The browser then checks the certificate to make sure it's valid and the server's identity is secure. Once the browser has verified the identity of the server, it can start sending and receiving data securely. The SSL certificate contains information about the server, including its identity, the certificate authority, and the date the certificate was issued. The certificate authority is an organization that verifies the identity of the server and issues the certificate. This organization is trusted by the browser and the server, so when you see a certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority, you know that the information is secure. When you visit a secure website, your browser sends a request to the server and the server responds with an SSL certificate. The browser then checks the certificate to make sure it's valid and the server's identity is secure. Once the browser has verified the identity of the server, it can start sending and receiving data securely.  "

"How is Voyager 1 still sending NASA information from interstellar space, 39 years after it's launch?","Voyager 1 was launched in 1977, and has been traveling through space for 39 years now.   powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, which is powered by the decay of radioactive isotopes. Voyager 1 has been in interstellar space since 2012, and is still sending data back to Earth.   powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which uses the heat generated by the decay of radioactive isotopes to generate electricity. Voyager 1's RTG is powered by plutonium-238, a radioactive isotope that decays into uranium-234, which in turn decays into uranium-235, which is the fuel used to power nuclear reactors. The RTG generates 420 watts of electricity, which is stored in a battery and then sent to the spacecraft's instruments and communications equipment. The RTG has a lifespan of about 12 years, but it's still generating electricity 39 years after its launch. The spacecraft has been in interstellar space since 2012, and is still sending data back to Earth.  "
Where are everyone's passwords stored in websites?,"I'm not an expert but I'll give it a shot. I'm sure there are more technical answers but this is my take on it. I'll try to keep it simple and easy to understand. There are a few different ways that websites store passwords. One way is by hashing. Hashing is like a one-way encryption. You can't get the original password back from the hashed password. So you can't use the hashed password to login to the website. But you can use the hashed password to verify that the password is correct. When you enter your password on a website, it hashes it and compares it to the hashed password that was stored when you created your account. If it matches, you get in. If it doesn't, you get denied. This is how most websites store passwords. Some websites store passwords in plain text. That means that the password is stored in plain text. If someone gains access to the website's database, they can see all of the passwords. This is very bad and websites should never store passwords in plain text. The other way that passwords are stored is by using a password vault. A password vault is like a safe deposit box. You put your password in the safe deposit box and then you have a key that you can use to unlock it.  "
How does an LED change colors?,"The most common way to change colors is by using different materials that absorb different wavelengths of light. For example, if you want to make a red LED, you would use a material that absorbs all wavelengths of light except for the red wavelength, and reflects all other wavelengths. This material is called a filter. There are many different types of filters you can use, and they can be made from materials like metals, plastics, or even glass. By carefully selecting the filter you use, you can control the color of the light that is emitted."

In other words, the axioms are the starting point, and theorems are the conclusions."
What causes irrational fear?,"Irrational fears are caused by a number of factors. Most of the time it's a combination of biological and psychological factors. The most common causes of irrational fears are: * Genetics: If someone in your family has a phobia, you may be more likely to develop one. * Brain chemistry: Some people may have an imbalance of brain chemicals that affects their emotional state, leading to irrational fears. * Trauma: People who have experienced traumatic events may develop irrational fears as a way to cope with the trauma. * Childhood experiences: People may develop irrational fears as a result of their upbringing or early experiences. * Social and cultural influences: People may develop irrational fears as a result of their social environment or cultural influences. * Media: People may develop irrational fears as a result of exposure to media that exaggerates the dangers of certain things. * Learning: People may develop irrational fears as a result of learning about certain things in school or from other sources. * Personality: People may have a personality type that makes them more prone to developing irrational fears. * Medical conditions: Some medical conditions, such as anxiety disorders or depression, may cause irrational fears."
We have vast fields dedicated to satellite dishes listening for signals in outer space. Why can't they install dishes on the moon for both listening to space and for bouncing signals back?,"The moon has no atmosphere, so there's no air to act as a lens to focus the signals. And the moon is just too small to have enough mass to attract and hold onto the signals. And the moon is also in the way of the signals from the earth, so it's hard to get a good view of the earth from the moon. And there's no atmosphere on the moon to protect the dishes from the hard radiation of space."
"If your brain uses 20% of your calorie intake, and your brain uses more energy when used intensely, does this mean you can lose weight from using your brain more intensely on a regular basis?","The brain is a very complex organ, and it is not as simple as saying that it uses 20% of your calorie intake. The brain is made up of a number of different types of cells, each of which has a different function, and each of which uses different amounts of energy. Additionally, the brain is constantly being used, and so it is always using some amount of energy. However, the amount of energy that the brain uses can be affected by a number of different things. For example, the brain uses more energy when you are thinking or concentrating. It also uses more energy when you are doing something that requires you to remember a lot of information, like reading a book or doing a puzzle. The brain also uses more energy when you are learning something new. In general, the brain uses more energy when you are doing something that requires you to think harder. However, it is important to remember that the brain is a very complex organ, and it is not as simple as saying that it uses 20% of your calorie intake. It is also important to remember that the brain is always being used, and so it is always using some amount of energy. It is also important to remember that the brain is very good at conserving energy.  "
How does a OLED TV work?,"I'll try to explain it as simply as possible. OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) is a type of display technology that is different from LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and LED (Light Emitting Diode). LCD displays use a backlight to illuminate liquid crystals, and the liquid crystals block the light to create an image. LED displays use an array of LEDs to illuminate the liquid crystals. OLED displays use an array of tiny, organic material (such as plastic) that can emit light when an electric current is applied.   is sandwiched between two electrodes, and when a current is applied between the electrodes, the organic material emits light. The amount of light that is emitted is controlled by the amount of current that is applied. OLED displays have several advantages over other display technologies. They have a higher contrast ratio than LCD displays, which means that they can display darker blacks and brighter whites. They also have a wider viewing angle than LCD displays, which means that the image looks the same from the side as it does from the front. They are also thinner and lighter than LCD displays. OLED displays are made by sandwiching an array of organic material between two electrodes, and then applying an electric current to the electrodes.  "
"Why in winter, on sunny days its really cold, and cloudy days its warm?","]( URL_0 ) > The difference between sunny and cloudy days is the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground. In winter, the Earth’s orbit is tilted away from the Sun, so the Sun is lower in the sky and the angle of the Sun’s rays is less direct. In addition, the atmosphere absorbs and scatters some of the sunlight, so less of it reaches the ground.   means that the Earth’s surface is cooler than it would be if the Sun were directly overhead. > On sunny days, the air near the ground is warmer than it is on cloudy days because the clouds reflect some of the sunlight back into space. However, the air above the clouds is cooler because the clouds absorb some of the sunlight.   is why the temperature increases with altitude on sunny days. > The temperature difference between sunny and cloudy days is not as great in the tropics as it is in temperate regions.   is because the Sun’s rays are more direct in the tropics than in temperate regions, so the temperature difference between sunny and cloudy days is smaller. > In temperate regions, the difference between sunny and cloudy days is greater in the winter than in the summer.   is because the atmosphere is more transparent in the winter than in the summer, so more of the sunlight reaches the ground.

How and why do almonds have a split directly down the middle?,"The reason for the split is due to the way the almonds grow. They are actually the edible seeds of a tree, and they grow inside a shell. The shell is a hard, greenish-brown color. The shell is made up of a tough material called cellulose, which is the same material that makes up the cell walls of plants. The cellulose is arranged in layers, and these layers are what give the shell its hardness. The cellulose is also what causes the shell to be brittle. When the almond is ripe, the shell is softened by the enzymes in the almond. The enzymes break down the cellulose, and this causes the shell to become soft. The almond then falls from the tree, and the hard shell splits open. The inside of the shell is a white, soft, and slightly sweet material called the endosperm. The endosperm is what the almond grows from, and it is what provides the nutrition for the almond. The endosperm is also the material that is used to make almond milk."
"Why September, October, November, December are 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th months of the year when in Greek (on which I guess it's based) it is more like Septa = 7, Octo = 8, Nona = 9, Deca = 10?","In the Roman calendar, the months were named after gods. September is named after the Roman goddess of harvest, Ceres. October is named after the Roman god of the harvest, October. November is named after the Roman goddess of the harvest, November. December is named after the Roman god of the harvest, December. The Roman gods are not the same as the Greek gods. The Roman gods were often named after the Greek gods, but they were not the same gods. The Roman gods were not always named after the Greek gods. In fact, many of the Roman gods were invented by the Romans, and not based on the Greek gods. The Roman gods were often named after the Roman calendar.

Why are knives and swords curved?,"The curve of the blade allows for more force to be applied to the cutting edge while maintaining a smaller cross sectional area. This makes it easier to cut through material. The curve also allows for the blade to be more stable and easier to control. The curve of the blade also allows for the blade to be used in a more efficient way. A straight blade will have to be moved along the material you are cutting, while a curved blade will be able to be moved along the material while also being able to cut through the material. This is very useful for cutting through thicker material."
"Adderall and Xanax are both addictive substances. Why is it that Adderall causes mild withdraw symptoms, if any, while Xanax induces a potentially lethal withdraw?","Adderall is a stimulant and Xanax is a benzodiazepine. Adderall works by stimulating the brain and increasing dopamine production, while Xanax works by slowing the brain down and increasing the amount of GABA, a neurotransmitter that slows down the brain. Adderall can cause withdrawal symptoms because it's a stimulant and your brain is used to it. When you stop using it, your brain needs to readjust. Xanax can cause withdrawal symptoms because it's a benzodiazepine and it can cause physical dependence. Xanax works by slowing down the brain, which makes it easier to breathe, sleep, and reduces anxiety. When you stop using Xanax, your brain needs to readjust and this can cause withdrawal symptoms."
Are all planets revolutions made in the same direction?," Certainly not. The first planet, Mercury, is in retrograde. The other planets are in direct rotation. The reason for this is due to the way they were formed. The first four planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are called the inner planets. They are so close to the Sun that they were formed with their rotation in the same direction as the Sun. The other four, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are called outer planets. They are so far away that they were formed with their rotation in the opposite direction of the Sun. The outer planets are much larger than the inner planets, so their rotation is slower. This is why the outer planets are always moving in the opposite direction of the Sun."

Why can't single cell organisms be huge? Why can't a single cell be the size of a person?," In the world of biology, there are many different ways to measure the size of an organism. One common way is to measure the volume of the organism. This is usually done by filling the organism with water, then measuring how much water it displaces. The volume of a single cell organism would be very small, and the volume of a person would be very, very large. The volume of a single cell organism would be measured in cubic centimeters, while the volume of a person would be measured in cubic meters. To give you an idea of how different these two measurements are, a typical single cell organism might have a volume of about 10^-12 cubic centimeters. The volume of a human cell, by contrast, might be about 10^-6 cubic centimeters. The volume of a human, on the other hand, might be about 10^-3 cubic meters. To put these measurements in perspective, a typical single cell organism is about 100,000 times smaller than a human cell, and a human is about 100,000,000 times larger than a single cell organism. As a general rule, the size of a cell is limited by the size of the membrane that surrounds it.  "

How and why does belly button lint accumulate overnight (or in general)?,"I'm a nurse and I know this one. The skin on your hands is the first place the body will lose moisture in the winter. This is because it's the first place to be exposed to cold air, and the skin on your hands is the first place the cold air will reach. The cold air will dry out the skin, causing it to crack and become dry. The cracking and dryness can also be caused by the cold weather drying out the skin, and the lack of moisture in the air. The cold weather also causes the skin to lose moisture, and the skin on your hands is the first place it will be lost.

How were mathematicians able to calculate pi without accurate measurements?,/u/TechnoViking here. I'm an 8th grade math teacher and I've been teaching this topic to my students for the past 2 years. I've been a bit surprised at how little students know about pi. I've been trying to find ways to make it more interesting for them. I've been reading some of the comments here and I think I might have a suggestion. What if we changed the way we teach pi? What if we taught it as a story? What if we used a historical figure to make it more interesting? What if we used a real-world application to make it more relevant? What if we used a story to make it more memorable? I'm not a historian but I think it would be really cool to teach pi as the story of Archimedes. I think it would be really cool to use a historical figure to make it more interesting.

Why are large mergers like T-mobile/ATT blocked on anti-trust concerns where smaller monopolies like Stanley/Craftsman go unchallenged?,"The real issue is that the merger is between two large companies in a market where there are only a few players. In this case, T-Mobile and AT&T are the only two major cell phone companies in the US. There are a few smaller companies, but they are not significant players. This concentration of power in a few hands is a concern, because it means that there are only a few companies that can compete for customers. The fear is that if the merger is allowed, the companies will use their combined power to try to drive smaller competitors out of business. This is exactly what happened in the airline industry. The government allowed American Airlines and US Airways to merge, and the result is that there are now only four major airlines in the US. This has led to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers. The government is trying to prevent the same thing from happening in the cell phone industry."
Why can the human eye not see infrared light?,"The human eye is designed to see light, and as a result it is not able to see infrared light. The reason for this is because light is a form of energy, and the human eye is designed to detect energy. The human eye is able to see the electromagnetic spectrum, which is the range of electromagnetic radiation that can be detected by the human eye. The electromagnetic spectrum ranges from radio waves to X-rays, and all of these types of radiation are visible to the human eye. The human eye is able to detect electromagnetic radiation because it contains specialized cells called photoreceptors. There are two types of photoreceptors, which are called rods and cones. The rods are specialized cells that are sensitive to low levels of light, and are responsible for detecting the ability to see in low light conditions. The cones are specialized cells that are sensitive to high levels of light, and are responsible for detecting the ability to see in bright light conditions. The cones are also responsible for detecting color. The human eye is able to see because the rods and cones are able to detect electromagnetic radiation, and then convert this into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. The brain is able to interpret these signals and use them to form an image of the world around us."

What causes body aches when fighting a fever?,"]( URL_0 ) The body aches are caused by the fever itself. The body has a built-in thermostat that regulates its temperature. When the body temperature goes up, the thermostat kicks in and starts to produce chemicals that make the muscles contract, which makes you feel like you're aching. When the body temperature goes down, the thermostat kicks in and starts to produce chemicals that relax the muscles. So, when you have a fever, your body is producing chemicals that make you feel like you're aching. This is because your body is trying to raise its temperature to fight the illness."
"If autonomous vehicles are to be the future of transportation, what steps are being taken to ensure they function in extreme weather conditions such as blizzards or black ice?"," (self-driving) cars have been tested in a variety of weather conditions, including blizzards. They are equipped with sensors and cameras that allow them to detect obstacles and make decisions based on that information. This information is then used to control the vehicle. In order to improve their ability to operate in extreme weather, researchers are experimenting with different sensors and cameras, and developing algorithms that allow them to learn from their experiences. It is also possible to use the cloud to improve their ability to operate in extreme weather. For example, if the car detects a problem with its sensors or cameras, it can communicate with the cloud to get a better idea of what is happening. This will allow the car to make better decisions and operate more safely. The sensors and cameras on these cars are able to detect a lot of information, but not everything. For example, they can detect objects in front of them, but not objects on the side or behind them. They can also detect the road surface, but not the weather. In order to improve their ability to operate in extreme weather, the sensors and cameras are being improved. They are also being equipped with additional sensors, such as those that detect the weather. The algorithms used to control the cars are also being improved.

Why do clouds turn dark when they are about to start raining?,"Clouds are made up of water droplets. The cloud becomes darker because the water droplets absorb more sunlight. This is because the water droplets are larger and more dense than the water droplets that are closer to the top of the cloud. When the water droplets absorb more sunlight, they heat up. When they heat up, they expand. When they expand, they become more buoyant and rise to the top of the cloud. This causes the cloud to become lighter and less dense. The water droplets in the bottom of the cloud are now less buoyant than the water droplets in the top of the cloud. This causes the cloud to become darker. This is why clouds turn dark before it rains."
How come there are so many companies offering free web hosting? What's the catch?,"Because it's not free. You have to pay for it, but you don't pay for it directly. You pay for it by having to look at ads. This is the same as paying for a subscription service like Netflix, but instead of paying money, you pay by watching ads. You can get a free subscription to Netflix if you're willing to watch ads. You can get a free web hosting service if you're willing to watch ads."
Why are some things 'oddly satisfying'?,"It's a bit hard to say, but one thing that might be going on is that odd shapes and patterns are more rare in nature than the more common shapes and patterns, so we're more likely to notice them and find them interesting. We're also more likely to notice things that are a little bit different or unexpected, so if you're looking at a pattern and see a little bit of something unexpected, it might be oddly satisfying. For example, if you're looking at a pattern of dots and you notice that one of the dots is a little bit brighter or darker than the others, you might find that a little bit satisfying. Another thing that might be going on is that odd shapes and patterns are more common in art, so if you're used to looking at art that has a lot of odd shapes and patterns, you might find them more satisfying. Also, if you're looking at something that's a little bit unusual, you might find it more satisfying if it's a little bit strange or unexpected. For example, if you're looking at a pattern that has a little bit of a weird twist to it, you might find it oddly satisfying."
"Why is it that if you look at a word for long enough, your brain will question its spelling, despite it being a simple and familiar word that's normally spelt with ease?","The light from the screen is actually hurting your eyes. It's not just a reflection of light, but a very specific wavelength of light. It's the same wavelength that is used in the eye to transmit light to the brain. So when the light is reflected off the screen, it's also reflecting off the back of your eye, and it's causing the eye to not be able to transmit the light to the brain. This is called ""photostress"". So to compensate for this, the eye blinks to clear the light out of the eye, and then the eye can focus again. This is why you see the screen flicker when you blink. The eye is adjusting its focus."
Why do we wake up in the middle of the night even when not triggered by dreams or external stimuli?,"We have a part of our brain called the ""default mode network"" that is active when we're not focused on anything else. It's active when we're daydreaming, thinking about the future, thinking about the past, or just laying there thinking about nothing. It's also active when we're sleeping and dreaming. It's thought to be responsible for things like memory consolidation, creativity, and thinking about our relationships with other people.  ake, our default mode network is less active. When we're sleeping, it's more active. When we're dreaming, it's even more active. It's like our brain is thinking about stuff when we're not. When we're sleeping, our default mode network is active, so it's like our brain is thinking about stuff when we're not. It's also thought to be the cause of dreams.  ake, our default mode network is less active, so it's like our brain isn't thinking about stuff when we're not. This is why we don't dream when we're awake. When we're sleeping, our default mode network is active, so it's like our brain is thinking about stuff when we're not. This is why we dream.  "

Why does a company want to sell my personal info? To whom? For how much? What's the data even look like?," The best answer I have ever seen is from the CEO of a company that sells personal data. He said something like, “I don’t know why you would care about your personal data, but I don’t think it’s worth much. It’s just your name, email, and phone number. It’s not like you’re a celebrity or anything. But if you want it, I can sell it to you for $100. It’s your data, and you can do whatever you want with it.”   is a good answer because it highlights the fact that personal data is not worth much, but it’s still valuable to the right person. The CEO of the company that sells personal data is probably not going to be able to sell it to a big corporation for a lot of money. But if you are a stalker who wants to know more about someone, then $100 is a lot of money.   is a good answer because it highlights the fact that personal data is not worth much, but it’s still valuable to the right person.

"when looking at the moon during the day, why is the dark side camouflaged by the blue sky?", The dark side of the moon is not camouflaged by the blue sky. The blue sky is the sky and the dark side of the moon is the dark side of the moon. The moon is only visible from Earth when it is in the right position in relation to the sun and the Earth. When the moon is in the right position the side of the moon that faces the Earth is illuminated by the sun and is visible to us. The side of the moon that faces away from the Earth is not illuminated by the sun and is not visible to us.
Can someone explain how high profile people can not pay taxes? How would they not be audited or investigated if they're suspicious?,"> How would they not be audited or investigated if they're suspicious? This is a common misconception.   a celebrity, you're not going to be audited. It's not that simple. There are two main ways to avoid paying taxes. The first is to hide money. If you have a bunch of money, you can put it in a secret account in the Cayman Islands.   a celebrity, you can have a bunch of money. You can have millions of dollars in a bank account. It's your money, and you can do whatever you want with it. If you put it in a secret account in the Cayman Islands, nobody will know. You won't get audited. You won't get investigated. The second way is to take advantage of tax loopholes. The government wants you to make money, so they offer tax loopholes to encourage you to make money.   a celebrity, you can take advantage of these loopholes.   a celebrity, you can put your money in a tax-free trust fund. You can donate money to charity. You can buy a house in a tax-free state. You can move your money to a tax-free country.  "
"Fluoride is added to water, but iodine is added to salt. What was the reasoning behind choosing these specific elements and where they should be added?","Fluoride is a very effective preventative against tooth decay. It’s added to water because you can’t add it to food. Iodine is added to salt because the body needs iodine. If you don’t get enough iodine, your thyroid gland won’t work properly. So you need it. The body doesn’t need fluoride. If you don’t get enough fluoride, your teeth will be soft and prone to decay. But you can live without fluoride. If you don’t get enough iodine, you can’t live without it. It’s a necessary nutrient."
Why are people swayed more by negative reviews than positive ones?,"The answer is actually pretty simple. It’s called the availability heuristic. It’s the idea that when we are faced with a decision, we rely on our mental shortcuts, or heuristics, to make the decision. One of the most common heuristics is the availability heuristic. It’s the idea that the more easily we can access the information in our minds, the more important it is. So if you are asked how many people in the world have cancer, you might say a few million. But if you are asked how many people have cancer in the world, you might say a few billion. The first number is much more readily accessible, so it’s much more important. The same is true for negative reviews. When a product or restaurant or whatever is reviewed, the negative reviews are far more readily accessible, so they are more important."
. How do dowsers work? (E.g in the location of groundwater supplies),The idea behind dowsing is that the water molecules will cause a small change in the magnetic field around the rod. The rod will move slightly depending on the strength of the magnetic field. Dowsers believe that the movement of the rod will point towards the water source. This is a controversial topic and there is no scientific evidence that it works. There are a number of different theories about how it could work. One is that the rod is being influenced by the Earths magnetic field and the rod is moving slightly as the magnetic field changes. Another is that the rod is being influenced by the water molecules and is moving slightly as the water molecules move. There is no scientific evidence to support either of these theories.
"Why is the top bun of a burger normally thicker than the bottom, when the bottom holds all the weight?","The top bun is thicker because it is the part that is most likely to get squished. The top bun is the part that the meat is sitting on, so it is the part that will be squished the most. The bottom bun is the part that is furthest from the meat and is the least likely to get squished. The top bun is also the part that the sauces and toppings are on. The bottom bun is the part that holds the sauces and toppings."

Why do we have different sizes for audio jacks (like 2.5mm and 3.5mm)? Does it make any difference other then the size of the plug?,"There are different sizes because different devices require different sizes. You can fit a 2.5mm plug into a 3.5mm jack, but it won't fit very well. The 3.5mm jack is the standard size for headphones, but not everyone uses it. Some people prefer 2.5mm jacks, and some people use other sizes. The standard size for headphones is 3.5mm. 2.5mm jacks are usually used for smaller things like earbuds. 3.5mm jacks are the standard size for headphones and most other audio devices. The reason for this is because the 3.5mm jack is the most common size for headphones and it is the size that is most commonly used. The reason why it is the most commonly used is because it is the most convenient size. The 3.5mm jack is the size of a standard USB connector and it is the same size as the standard audio connector. This means that you can use a 3.5mm headphone jack to connect to a USB port on a computer, or you can use it to connect to an audio output on a computer. The 2.5mm jack is smaller than the 3.5mm jack and it is used for smaller audio devices. It is a good size for smaller devices because it is smaller than the 3."
How come when you're sick you can blow your nose and they'll be completely empty and 5 minutes later they're full and dripping. How does mucus generate so quickly and where is it even made.,"Mucus is a thick, slimy substance produced by your body to trap dust, bacteria, and other particles that enter your body. It is produced by the mucus membranes in your body. The mucus membranes are thin layers of tissue that line the inside of your nose, mouth, throat, lungs, and other organs. They are rich in mucin, a protein that makes up the bulk of mucus. Mucus is a normal part of your body and serves an important purpose. It helps to trap foreign particles that enter your body and keep them from getting into your lungs. It also helps to keep your lungs moist so that they can function properly. When you blow your nose, you are forcing mucus out of your nose, which is why it can look like it's empty for a moment before filling up again."
"Why do sites like Youtube and Facebook (but especially Youtube) continuously modify their interface with new skin, color, and features, despite the negative reception of their userbase?"," Money. They have to keep their users engaged and entertained. If they keep changing the layout and features, then users don’t get bored and leave. It’s like a video game. You can’t just play the same game over and over again. You have to keep adding new features and challenges to keep people interested. It’s also good for the developers. They can get ideas for new features from what users like and dislike about the site. They also want to keep their users engaged, so they keep adding new features to keep them coming back. They also want to make sure that people are using the site in the way that the company wants them to use it. They can do this by adding features that encourage people to use the site in a certain way. They can also do this by removing features that people are using in a way that the company doesn’t want. I have a theory about this. They are trying to make money off of their users. If they keep changing the layout and features, then users will be more likely to click on ads. They also have to keep people engaged so they can use their data to sell ads. The more people are engaged, the more data they can collect. I have no idea if this is true, but it seems like it could be."
Why does meth make users skin so ugly and old-looking?,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""ugly and old-looking"".

There are a lot of ways to die of something else, but the most common cause of death is a heart attack or stroke. There are a lot of ways to die of a heart attack or stroke, but the most common cause of death is blood clots that form in your arteries. Blood clots can form in your arteries for a lot of different reasons, but the most common reason is that the walls of your arteries become damaged, and the clotting of the blood becomes more likely. That damage can be caused by a lot of things, but the most common cause is atherosclerosis, which is a buildup of plaque in your arteries. This is a result of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, and obesity. The plaque is made of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and other substances, and it can accumulate in your arteries, causing damage to the inner lining of the artery. The damage can lead to inflammation and a buildup of platelets in the area, which can cause blood clots to form. The clots can then block the flow of blood to the heart, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.  "

How and why do our limbs feel fuzzy when they fall asleep?,"The nerves that supply your limbs have a protective layer called myelin. The myelin acts like insulation on a wire and helps to keep the nerve signal strong and clear. When you are cold, the myelin layer gets thinner and weaker. This is why your hands and feet feel so cold when you are outside in the winter. When your limbs are cold, the nerves in your limbs are also cold, which means they can't send signals to your brain as clearly as they should. When your limbs fall asleep, the nerves in your limbs are still sending signals, but they are weak and unclear. This is why your limbs feel fuzzy. The fuzziness is because the signals are weak. Your brain is still trying to figure out what is going on, so it is a little confused."
how does sound escape an airtight room?,"Sound waves are made by vibrations. In a room, there are many different things that can vibrate, like the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and the objects inside the room. These vibrations make sound waves. The vibrations can be made by a person talking, by a fan, by a car outside, or by anything else that makes noise. When a sound wave is made, it travels through the air. Sound waves are very good at moving through air. They can travel very far. In a room, the sound waves can travel from one end of the room to the other. But, if there is a wall in the way, the sound waves can’t get through the wall. So, the sound waves can’t get out of the room."

"When you have a cold, why do your symptoms feel worse right after you wake up?","It's all about the temperature change. When you wake up, your body is still cold from sleeping. When you get in the shower, you get a sudden, drastic change in temperature. Your body has to adjust, and that's what makes you feel better. You're probably feeling worse because you're more awake and alert. When you're asleep, your body is running on autopilot and it doesn't really care about how you feel.

Why does every human/household have a specific scent and why is everyone's different?,"It's because of a chemical called trimethylamine. It's a chemical that's found in fish and is produced by bacteria that live in the gut of animals. Everyone has it in their gut and it's released into the air when we sweat. Everyone's gut is different, so everyone's sweat is different and therefore everyone's smell is different."
How do airplanes avoid issues with snow/ice on the runway when taking off or landing?,"The airplane has a special anti-ice system on the wings, called the de-ice system. This is used to prevent ice from forming on the wings during flight, and also to clear off the wings when necessary. When the airplane is on the ground, the de-ice system is turned off. But when the airplane is in flight, it is turned on. This is done automatically, so the pilot doesn't have to do anything. The de-ice system works by spraying water on the wings. This is the same thing that you see on cars in the winter, but it is a lot more powerful. The airplane is designed to be able to spray water on the wings at a rate of 500 gallons per minute. The de-ice system is powered by the airplane's engines.   uses a special fan that is connected to the engines. The fan is connected to a pump that is connected to the de-ice system. This pump is powered by the engines, so it can spray water on the wings at a rate of 500 gallons per minute. This is a lot faster than a car's de-ice system. The de-ice system also has a special heating system. This is used to keep the water from freezing on the wings.  "

Why does string theory require that there be 10 dimensions?,"String theory is a theory that attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. The theory states that all of the particles in the universe are not point-like objects, but tiny, vibrating strings. The theory attempts to explain how these strings can interact with each other and how they can give rise to the particles we observe in the universe. The theory also attempts to explain the properties of space-time itself. In order to do this, string theory requires the existence of extra dimensions beyond the familiar three dimensions of space and one dimension of time that we experience in our everyday lives. The reason for this is that the theory states that the strings that make up the universe are not point-like objects, but tiny, vibrating strings. These strings must be able to vibrate in order to give rise to the particles that we observe. In order to do this, the strings must be able to move back and forth in the extra dimensions beyond our familiar three. The theory also states that these extra dimensions must be compactified, or curled up, in order to explain why we do not observe them in our everyday lives. The compactification of these dimensions is a key part of the theory. The theory also states that the universe is made up of multiple universes, each of which is separated from each other by a membrane.  "
"How does the United States Treasury Department know how much money to produce, printing notes and stamping coins, each year?",The US Treasury Department is the department responsible for the production and distribution of currency. There are a number of different factors that go into deciding how much currency to print. The first is the amount of money that is needed to replace notes and coins that are worn out or lost. The second is the amount of money that is needed to meet the needs of the economy. The third is the amount of money that is needed to meet the needs of the government.

"There are definitely exceptions to this, but I was talking to a friend recently and we noticed that the phrases ""Momma's boy"" and ""Daddy's girl"" are a lot more common than ""Momma's girl"" and ""Daddy's boy"". What makes a child more likely to bond to the parent of the opposite sex?","I'm not sure, but I have a hunch that it's because the child is more likely to bond with a parent who is similar to them. The most important thing for a child is that they feel loved and accepted, and they get that from their parents. So if they have a parent who is similar to them, they are more likely to feel loved and accepted. And I think that's why they are more likely to bond to that parent. & #x200B; & #x200B; Also, I think it's a lot more common for men to bond with their mothers than it is for women to bond with their fathers. And I think that's because of the way that society is structured. Women are expected to be nurturing and emotional, and men are expected to be strong and stoic. So men are more likely to bond with their mothers because they are more likely to be nurturing and emotional, and they are less likely to be expected to be strong and stoic. & #x200B; & #x200B; This is just my opinion, and I don't have any research to back it up.

Why does soda make the spicy feeling worse after eating something hot?," The sensation of heat is perceived by the nerve endings in your mouth. This sensation is caused by the activation of the TRPV1 (Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1) receptor, which is activated when there is a temperature change in the mouth. The activation of this receptor is what gives you the sensation of heat. When you eat something hot, the activation of the TRPV1 receptor is triggered, and this causes the release of neurotransmitters which are then transmitted to the brain. These neurotransmitters include capsaicin, which is responsible for the sensation of spiciness. The activation of the TRPV1 receptor also causes the release of the neurotransmitter substance P, which is responsible for the sensation of pain. When you drink a cold soda, the cold temperature activates the TRPV1 receptor, which releases the neurotransmitter substance P. This substance P then binds to the substance P receptors in the brain, which are found in the spinal cord and the brain. This binding causes the brain to perceive the sensation of pain. This is why drinking a cold soda makes the spicy feeling worse."
"When someone is struck in the testicles, why is the pain often times felt in the abdomen instead of only the point of impact?","Because your testicles are inside your abdomen. It's like how if you get hit in your hand, you feel it in your arm. The pain is transmitted through nerves. The nerves that transmit the pain from your testicles to your brain are also the nerves that transmit the pain from your abdomen to your brain. When you get hit in the abdomen, your brain is already thinking ""testicles hurt"" so it's easier to interpret the pain as coming from the testicles instead of the abdomen."
Why do we say that looks aren't important when we actually get attracted more by looks than personality?,"Because it’s a social construct. There is no objective answer to the question of what makes a person attractive. The reason we think looks are important is because that’s what society tells us is important. We’re taught that looks are important from a young age, and that’s what we’re taught to look for in a partner. We’re also taught that looks are important in business and career, and that’s what we’re taught to look for in a job. The way we perceive attractiveness is a social construct. It’s a cultural construct, and it’s a cultural construct that’s been shaped by society. It’s not a fact, it’s not a scientific fact, it’s not a fact of nature. It’s a fact of culture."

Can you sneeze in your sleep?,"Yes, but it is not the same as sneezing when you are awake.

"If black coffee and diet pop are mostly water, why do they not hydrate the body?","A couple of reasons. One, water is the only thing that hydrates the body. Everything else is a diuretic, meaning it will make you pee. This is why you don't want to drink alcohol or caffeine with plain water, as it will make you pee more, which is not good for your kidneys. Two, your body can't tell the difference between water and caffeine, so it will process it the same way. The caffeine will just make you pee more. If you want to hydrate your body, drink plain water. If you want a caffeine boost, drink a plain water with a little bit of sugar."
Why does prolonged screen time make me feel so drained?," Pull out your phone, open a browser, and search for the term ""screen time"". You'll find a whole lot of articles about the negative effects of screen time on our mental health. Why is this? Why does staring at a screen for hours on end make us feel so drained? This is a question that I've been pondering for a while now, and I finally found a good explanation. First, let's talk about the brain. The brain is like a battery that runs out of energy. When we're awake, the brain is constantly working and consuming energy. When we're not working, our brain is resting, and recharging. When we're staring at a screen, the brain is working hard. It's trying to process the information, and understand the content. This is exhausting. The brain is not designed for this. Our brain is designed to process information in a more natural way, like reading a book or listening to a lecture. When we're staring at a screen, we're not reading a book or listening to a lecture. We're staring at a screen, and our brain is trying to process the information on the screen. This is exhausting. Now, let's talk about the eyes. When we're staring at a screen, our eyes are constantly moving.  "
How come soldiers today don't wear full armour that covers their entire body? Knights were able to move easily and with todays technology making a soldier bulletproof should be easy.,"It's a combination of a few things. First, modern weapons are much more powerful than medieval weapons. Bullets are much more powerful than arrows and swords are much more powerful than clubs. Modern armor is designed to stop bullets, but it's not practical to wear a full suit of armor that stops bullets. Bulletproof vests are the most common form of armor. Second, modern armor is made of lighter materials. Modern armor is made of Kevlar, which is a synthetic material that is very strong and lightweight. This makes it easy to move around and fight. Finally, modern soldiers don't need to fight hand-to-hand. Modern warfare is mostly fought from a distance. The best way to protect yourself in a modern war is to stay behind cover and shoot at the enemy from a distance. This means that soldiers don't need to wear armor to protect themselves from enemy weapons."
Why are Credit Ratings Agencies Private For-Profit Institutions?,"A credit rating agency is a company that rates the creditworthiness of corporations, municipalities, and other entities. Ratings are given based on the likelihood of the entity defaulting on its debt obligations. The most well-known of the rating agencies is Moody’s, but there are actually three major rating agencies. Credit ratings are important because they give investors an idea of how risky a particular investment is. Investors are willing to take on more risk if the potential reward is higher, but if the risk is too high, they won’t invest. So credit ratings can help investors decide whether or not to invest in a particular company. The rating agencies are private for-profit companies, but they are regulated by the SEC. There are a couple of reasons why they are private. First, they are paid by the companies that they rate. This is a problem because it means that the companies are incentivized to rate themselves highly, even if they don’t deserve it. This is why there have been numerous scandals and controversies involving rating agencies. Second, the rating agencies are not required to disclose their methods, so there is no way to know how they arrived at their ratings. This is also a problem because there are no consequences for the rating agencies if they are wrong.  "
Why do people breathe harder as they get fatter?,"When you get fatter, your body has to work harder to move oxygen around. This means you breathe harder to get the oxygen you need. In addition, fat people tend to have more fat in their neck and chest. This makes breathing harder because the fat makes it harder to move air in and out of your lungs."
Why does a goldfish die when you transfer him form muddy water to clean water ?,Goldfish live in muddy water. They are adapted to survive in muddy water. They have special gills that can filter out the mud. They also have a special type of skin that protects them from the mud. They don't have these special features in clean water. It's like if you took a cat from a house and put it in the ocean. It would die because it can't breathe in salt water. The same thing happens to goldfish. They can't survive in clean water.
Why do Kettle chips get different bags?,"Because they are made by different companies. They are all owned by PepsiCo, but they are separate companies.

There is a bag of Lay's that has flavors like Cheddar Cheese, Sour Cream and Onion, and Chicken Taco. There is also a bag of Lay's that has flavors like Sweet Chili Heat, Spicy Taco, and Chili Cheese. Ruffles has flavors like Sour Cream and Onion, Cheddar Cheese, and Chili Cheese. They also have different bags. Lay's has bags with different shapes, like a square or a circle. Ruffles has bags that are more like a square, but they are not really square. They have a rounded top. PepsiCo also owns other companies that make chips, like Doritos and Tostitos. They are different."
Why does sunlight bleach/lighten things?,"Because of the UV light, which is one of the visible light spectrum. It has a shorter wavelength than visible light, which is why it can penetrate through things like glass, water, and plastic. UV light can also cause things to react, like the formation of ozone, which is a very strong oxidizing agent. It can also react with the molecules in the things it hits, like the formation of free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can cause other molecules to react, like the formation of ozone. This is why you don't want to be exposed to UV light for too long, because it can cause damage to your skin and eyes."
Is there an advantage to using the Imperial System of measurement instead of the Metric System?,"We can see that the light from distant galaxies is redshifted. This is because the galaxies are moving away from us and the light is being stretched out. We can also measure the redshift of light from other sources like supernovae, which also indicate that the universe is expanding.  "
Why can't helium balloons float upside down?,"Because cats are lazy. Also, because they have a very low metabolism.

"How do we define the age of a meteoroid? (so how old is this piece of rock from space, when it's older than the earth itself?)","We can't. We can't know how old it is, because it's not made of any material that we know of, and we don't have any way to date it. It's just a rock that came from space. It doesn't have any relation to the earth, so it's not relevant to the earth's age. The earth is 4.5 billion years old, and it's not relevant to this meteoroid."
How long should food take to journey from the mouth to the bathroom?,"This is a pretty subjective question. It depends on how much food you eat and how fast you eat it. The average person eats about 2000 calories a day, which is about 4000 calories a day if you eat twice. So if you eat 4000 calories in a day, you might be able to digest 2000 calories of that food in 4 hours, but it would take 8 hours to digest 2000 calories. It's a little more complicated than that though. The rate at which your body digests food is based on a lot of factors, including how much food you eat, how much exercise you get, and how healthy you are in general. The healthier you are, the faster you digest food. Also, the healthier you are, the less likely you are to eat too much. So you might eat 1000 calories a day instead of 4000, and it would take 20 hours to digest 1000 calories instead of 4 hours."
"fix: What is actually happening when an aquatic animal is said to be able to ""hold its breath"" for x hours.","Aquatic animals are not breathing air. They are breathing water. The gills take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. The oxygen is then used to fuel the fish's muscles and other bodily functions. The fish's heart is also much more efficient than a mammal's, so it doesn't need to beat as fast. This is why you see fish swimming slowly. They don't need to move fast to get enough oxygen. Aquatic animals also have a lot of specialized muscles that are adapted to swimming. They don't need to move their limbs as much as a mammal would to move through the water. So they don't need to breathe as much."
Why do you sometimes wake up with a headache if you've slept for too long (i.e. more than 9 hours)?,"I'm not a doctor but I have heard that if you sleep too long it can cause blood to pool in your head which causes a headache. It also causes you to become dehydrated which also causes headaches. I have heard that some people get a headache after sleeping too long because their body's muscles and joints have gotten stiff, and the headache is caused by the muscles and joints being stretched out. I have also heard that the blood flow to the brain is reduced, which can cause a headache. I have heard that the headache is caused by the body's internal clock, which regulates sleep and wakefulness, and this clock is disrupted when you sleep too long.   have a lot of dreams, which can cause a headache.   be in a state of confusion, which can cause a headache.   feel dizzy and lightheaded, which can cause a headache.   feel nauseous, which can cause a headache.   feel weak, which can cause a headache.

Can't you simply guess a PaySafeCard pin since it only contains numbers?,"Because different countries have different economic systems. It's the same as why there are different types of cars. It's not really possible to have one car that is both a car and a plane. There are a lot of different types of currency. I don't think it's because there are a lot of different economic systems.

How is it possible that steel has a scent?,"The smell of steel comes from the oxidation of the steel. Steel is made of iron and carbon. The carbon content determines the color of the steel. If the carbon content is low, the steel will be silver or white, and if it is high, it will be red. The carbon content also determines the hardness of the steel. If the carbon content is low, the steel will be soft and easy to bend. If it is high, the steel will be hard and resistant to bending. The oxidation of the steel comes from exposure to air. The carbon atoms in the steel react with oxygen in the air to form iron oxide. Iron oxide is a red-orange substance that is often referred to as rust. The rusting of the steel is what gives it a metallic smell. The smell is due to the iron oxide. It is the same smell that you get when you burn iron."
How does stress cause acne?,"Stress causes the release of hormones called glucocorticoids, which are very similar to the hormones released during puberty. These hormones can cause the skin to produce more oil, and the oil to be thicker, which can cause clogged pores and acne. Stress can also cause inflammation, which can make acne worse. Stress can also lead to a decrease in immune function, which can make the skin more vulnerable to infections that can cause acne."
"If a nuclear missile is launched, why can't someone just shoot it down while it is still high in the air?","It's a matter of physics. The missile is traveling at the speed of sound (or faster) and the bullet would have to travel at the speed of sound (or faster) to catch up to it. And if the bullet is traveling at the speed of sound, it will have the same air resistance as the missile, and it will not be able to accelerate further. So it's not possible to shoot down a missile that is traveling at the speed of sound or faster. The bullet would have to be moving at a speed greater than the speed of sound. The bullet would need to be moving at the speed of sound to be able to catch up to the missile."
"Why do humans laugh in bursts like ""Ha ha ha"" instead of one long ""haaaaaaaaaaa""?","There are a few reasons why we laugh in bursts instead of one long laugh. The first is that it's a lot easier to make a sound that is repeated than it is to make a sound that is sustained. This is because our vocal cords are made up of muscles, and those muscles have a lot of control over how tightly they are held together. If you want to make a sound that is sustained, you have to keep your vocal cords tightly held together for a long time. If you want to make a sound that is repeated, you have to relax your vocal cords for a little bit between each repetition. This is why it's easier to make a ""ha ha ha"" sound than a ""haaaa"" sound. The second reason is that the sound of our laughter is not just determined by the muscles in our vocal cords, but also by the muscles in our diaphragm. When we laugh, our diaphragm contracts, which causes our vocal cords to move up and down. When we make a ""ha ha ha"" sound, our vocal cords are moving up and down, but our diaphragm is only contracting enough to make a small sound. When we make a ""haaaa"" sound, our diaphragm is contracting enough to make a louder sound.  "
"Is it really important to human in critical condition to stay conscious, and why?"," P.S. I don't have an answer for this question, but I hope someone here can help me out. I am really curious about this. I am not a doctor, but I am a neuroscientist, and I can tell you that the brain is a very complex organ, and consciousness is one of its most mysterious aspects. As far as we know, consciousness is not a single entity, but rather a collection of processes that are happening in the brain. These processes are still not fully understood, but they involve a lot of different areas of the brain, and they are very active, even when you are asleep or unconscious. So, the question of why it is important to stay conscious is a very good one. There are many reasons why we might want to stay conscious, but they are all a bit abstract and hard to understand. It is also very hard to study consciousness, because we don't really know what it is, and we don't really know how to measure it. So, I can only tell you that there are a lot of different theories about what consciousness is, and what it does, and why it is important. One of the most popular theories is that consciousness is a way of knowing about the world, and that it is important because it allows us to make decisions and solve problems.  "
Why is it that major internet service providers are starting to add bandwidth limits? Shouldn't service get better and less restrictive as infrastructure improves?,"Џ, I'm a developer, so I'll give you a developer's answer. It's not a matter of the infrastructure, it's a matter of the business model. The infrastructure is paid for by the customers, and the customers are paying for the bandwidth. The bandwidth is limited because the customers are paying for it, and the customers don't want to pay for more bandwidth than they need. If you want to pay for more bandwidth, you can, but you have to pay for it. If you're not paying for it, you can't have it. It's like if you were renting an apartment, and you wanted to paint the walls a different color. You can paint the walls a different color, but you have to pay for the paint. If you don't pay for it, you can't have it. In the case of the internet, it's not that simple, because the internet is run by a bunch of different companies, and they all have different business models. The business models are all different because they were designed by different people, and they were designed to make money in different ways. Some companies charge you by the amount of data you use, and others charge you by the amount of time you use the internet. Some companies have a flat rate, and others have a variable rate.  "
How can a touchscreen project black in a power saving way (details on the screen inside)?,"...if you look at the black pixel in a LCD screen, it is actually a very thin layer of black plastic that blocks light. In order to make it black, the plastic layer is placed over the white layer. The black layer is very thin and transparent, so it doesn't really block any light. However, it blocks the light that hits it from the white layer below, and thus looks black. It's the same principle as a light switch. If you turn it off, the light doesn't go out, it just hits a black layer that blocks it. A touchscreen has a white layer that is transparent, so that it can see what you are touching. In order to make it look black, the black layer is placed over the white layer. This black layer is very thin and transparent, so it doesn't really block any light. However, it blocks the light that hits it from the white layer below, and thus looks black. In order to make it power save, the black layer is placed over the white layer only when the screen is black. This means that the black layer is only on the screen when it is black, and not when it is white. This way, the screen uses less power, because the black layer is not on all the time."

Why are we cool with moldy cheese but freak out over moldy bread?,"It's not that we are ""cool"" with moldy cheese, it's that we have evolved to accept it. Cheese is a fermented food, which means it's been exposed to microorganisms that break it down and change its flavor. In fact, cheese is one of the most heavily fermented foods we eat. So we've learned to accept that cheese will have a bit of mold on it, and it's actually a sign of quality. Moldy bread, on the other hand, is a sign of spoilage. It's been exposed to too much moisture and has started to rot. It's not a sign of quality, and it's not something we've evolved to accept. So we're more likely to freak out about it."

Please explain the Star Trek Stardate calendar system. Is it nonsense or based on something scientifical?,"It's a fictional system that has been used in various Star Trek series. It's based on the concept of measuring time based on the distance to a star. In the Star Trek universe, ships use a device called a ""stardate"" to measure the distance to a star, which is then used to calculate the time that has passed since the last time they were at that star. The system is based on the concept of a ""light year,"" which is the distance that light travels in a year. In the Star Trek universe, a light year is 6.3 trillion miles. One light year is equivalent to 63 trillion miles, or 5.88 trillion kilometers. This is why the stardate system is so confusing, because it's based on a unit of measurement that is not used in the real world. In the Star Trek universe, a stardate is the distance to a star, expressed in light years. For example, the stardate of 3100.0 means that the ship is 3100 light years from the star that it is currently at. In the Star Trek universe, the stardate system is used to measure the passage of time.  "
"Why do some people have an overwhelming urge to playfully bite newborn babies? ""I just want to eat them up!"" etc.","I think it's a combination of things. Firstly, it's a reflex to try and get the baby to suckle. Secondly, it's a way to test the baby's immune system. Babies are born with a slightly acidic stomach, which is a protective mechanism against infection. When you bite a baby, you introduce a small amount of acid to its mouth, which can help to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. Finally, it's also a way to check the baby's teeth. Babies are born without teeth, but they start to come in around 6 months old."

"Is it possible for a 5,8ft male to eat only 1200 calories per day, to lose weight, if he has no real muscles to begin with?"," I'm not a doctor but I'm going to give you my opinion. If you're a 5'8"" male and you weigh 170 pounds, then you're probably about 15% body fat. If you want to get to 10% body fat, you'll need to lose about 10 pounds of fat. To do that, you'll need to eat less calories than you burn. The standard recommendation for weight loss is to eat 500 calories fewer than your daily burn. So, you'll need to eat 1200 calories per day, and burn 1700 calories per day. That's a 10% deficit.   can do that by reducing your carbohydrate intake, increasing your protein intake, and reducing your fat intake. I recommend you check out the ketogenic diet, which is a low carb, moderate protein, high fat diet that can help you achieve your weight loss goals. However, if you're not eating enough protein, you'll probably feel weak and fatigued. So, you'll need to eat about 30-40 grams of protein per day. I recommend you check out the recommended daily protein intake for your weight, and then increase it by 10-20 grams.  "
Why do some websites say it takes 72 hours to remove you from their mailing list? Why isn't it instantaneous?,"The spots act as camouflage in the wild.

In 1972, a man named Robert Stickgold and his colleagues published a study in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology that suggested that sleep paralysis is caused by a failure of the brain's ability to switch between two different states: wakefulness and sleep. They found that people who experienced sleep paralysis had a higher incidence of narcolepsy, a condition in which people fall asleep at inappropriate times. They also found that people who experienced sleep paralysis had a higher incidence of hallucinations, which is another symptom of narcolepsy. This led them to the conclusion that sleep paralysis is caused by a failure of the brain to switch between wakefulness and sleep. The researchers also found that the brain's ability to switch between these two states is controlled by a chemical called adenosine, which is produced in the brain and makes us feel tired.  "
how come some people perspire much more than others?,"Because some people have a genetic variation that causes them to produce more sweat. Some people have a variation that makes them sweat less. But for the most part, it's just a matter of how much sweat glands a person has. The number of sweat glands in your body is determined by a combination of your genes and your hormones. Some people have more sweat glands than others, which is why some people sweat more than others."
Why have I never heard of an animal fainting? Is it rarer for them to faint than humans or something similar?," Cause I have heard of a dog fainting before. I don't know if it's more common or rare for animals to faint, but I do know that dogs are more likely to experience it. I have a dog that faints sometimes. It's usually when she's in the heat and it's hot outside. I've also heard that dogs can faint from being startled or scared. I've never heard of an animal fainting, but I have heard of animals being stunned, which is similar. I've never heard of a dog fainting. I do know that dogs have a higher heart rate than humans so I imagine it would be more likely that they would faint due to overexertion or overheating. I have never heard of a dog fainting. I have never heard of a dog fainting. I have a dog that faints sometimes. I don’t know why. She just goes limp and then wakes up. I’ve never heard of a dog fainting. I have a dog that faints. He faints when he’s hot and gets overwhelmed. It’s pretty common for him to faint. I’ve never heard of a dog fainting. I have a cat that faints. It's not really fainting though.  "
The proper use of commas. And other grammar that is used in everyday business language.,"The proper use of commas is crucial to maintaining proper grammar. There are two types of commas. A regular comma and an Oxford comma. The regular comma is used to separate items in a list. For example, if you were to write “I like pizza, pasta, and tacos” you would use a regular comma. The Oxford comma is used to separate items in a list and also to separate clauses in a sentence. For example, if you were to write “I like pizza, pasta and tacos” you would use an Oxford comma. Proper use of commas is important for a few reasons. The first reason is that it helps to make sentences easier to read. By using commas, you can break up a sentence into smaller parts. This makes it easier for the reader to understand. The second reason is that it helps to make sentences more clear. By using commas, you can separate clauses that are being used to explain something. For example, if you were to write “I like pizza, pasta and tacos. I also like sushi” you would use an Oxford comma. Without the Oxford comma, the sentence would be confusing. The third reason is that it helps to maintain consistency. If you use commas in one sentence, you should use them in all sentences. By using commas consistently, you make your writing easier to read and understand.  "
Does true randomness exist?,"I’m not an expert but I’ll try my best. I’m sure there are better explanations but here’s what I know. In a nutshell, the answer is no. There is no true randomness in the universe. This is because everything in the universe is governed by physical laws which means there is no randomness in the way things behave. The concept of randomness is really just a way of describing the unpredictability of something. If we can’t predict something we call it random. But the fact that we can’t predict something doesn’t mean it’s random.  "
What happens when you go into a coma? Is it just a very long dream?,"A coma is a condition where the brain is no longer functioning properly. It's not a dream. The person is unconscious and incapable of feeling pain, or experiencing any other senses. There is no way to tell if someone is dreaming or not. There is no way to tell if someone is conscious or not. The person is in a state of deep sleep, but they are not dreaming. When someone goes into a coma, the brain is essentially shutting down. It's not really a dream, it's a state where the body is no longer functioning. The person is no longer conscious, they don't feel anything, and their body is no longer functioning. They can't move, they can't feel pain, they can't see, they can't hear, they can't taste, they can't smell. They're basically dead. They're not dreaming, they're just not conscious. They're not in a dream, they're in a coma. It's not a dream. They're not conscious. They're not dreaming. They're in a coma. They're not in a dream, they're not conscious. They're not dreaming. They're in a coma. The brain is not functioning.  "
"What's the difference between LFTR reactors and traditional nuclear reactors? And if they're safer, why aren't we using them instead?","We can see that the universe is expanding because light coming from a galaxy is redshifted. Light is blue shifted as it moves away from us, and redshifted as it moves towards us. The farther away the galaxy, the more redshifted the light. The redshift is a direct measure of the distance. The more distant the galaxy, the more the light is redshifted. We can measure the redshift of light coming from galaxies, and plot it against the distance. We can see that the redshift increases as the distance increases. If the universe was not expanding, the redshift would be constant. If the universe was contracting, the redshift would be constant. The fact that the redshift increases as the distance increases is evidence that the universe is expanding."
"With the current way the earth orbits the sun, are the hottest seasons for the equator spring and fall?",I'm just a random person on the internet but I think I can help you with this. The Earth orbits the Sun in an ellipse. The Sun is at one of the two foci of the ellipse. The distance of the Earth to the Sun is maximum at perihelion (the point where the Earth is closest to the Sun) and minimum at aphelion (the point where the Earth is furthest from the Sun).   tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees. The Earth is thus at a point in its orbit where the Sun is directly overhead (summer) or directly underfoot (winter).   tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees. The Earth is thus at a point in its orbit where the Sun is directly overhead (summer) or directly underfoot (winter).   tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees.

Why is there a notable distinction in taste between food that is hot and cold?,"The reason is due to the molecules in the food. When food is hot, the molecules are moving quickly. When food is cold, the molecules are moving slowly. The faster the molecules are moving, the more flavor is released from the food. When food is hot, the molecules are moving so fast that they are constantly bumping into each other, which releases more flavor. When food is cold, the molecules are moving slowly and are not bumping into each other as much, which means that there is less flavor released. The faster the molecules are moving, the more flavor is released."
"What goes on with blacklights that fudge up the visuals when in them, like glow-in-the-dark mini-golf?","Black lights emit ultraviolet light. This is the light that is invisible to humans, but visible to many organisms, including the fluorescent dyes used to make glow-in-the-dark objects. The dyes absorb UV light, and then emit light of a different wavelength. This is why things that are not normally visible will glow in the dark."
Why is it that teeth come in symmetrical pairs but aren't all the same shape?," Pair of teeth that are identical in shape, size, and color are called homodonts. This is a rare condition, occurring only in 1 in 3000 cases. If a person has homodonts, it is likely that they will have other abnormalities, such as a cleft palate, heart defects, or other congenital abnormalities. Homodonts are also more susceptible to dental problems, including tooth decay and gum disease."
What is the difference between the US Senate and House of Representatives?,"The House of Representatives is the lower chamber of Congress, and has 435 members, each representing a district in one of the 50 states. The Senate is the upper chamber of Congress, and has 100 members, with two senators representing each of the 50 states. The House of Representatives is elected by the people of each district, while the Senate is elected by the people of each state.   initiate tax bills, while the Senate has the power to confirm presidential appointments.   impeach federal officials, while the Senate has the power to try impeachment cases. The House of Representatives is responsible for drafting legislation, while the Senate must approve the legislation before it can be sent to the president. The House of Representatives must approve all spending bills, while the Senate must approve all revenue bills. The House of Representatives must approve all legislation that raises taxes or spending, while the Senate must approve all legislation that reduces taxes or spending. The House of Representatives is responsible for conducting oversight of the executive branch, while the Senate conducts oversight of the judicial branch.   initiate investigations, while the Senate must approve all investigations.

"Now that we're seeing 10 gigabit USB and even faster Thunderbolt on laptops, how come we dont have any laptops with 10 gigabit ethernet?","Most laptops don't need it. They don't need 10gbit ethernet. They can use the 100mbit standard. Even 1gbit standard is enough for most users. It's only if you're a high-end user that you'd need faster internet speeds. But even then, it's not like you need 10gbit ethernet. You could use a USB 3.0 ethernet adapter, or a wireless connection. It's not like you need to be connected to your laptop all the time. You can leave it in your bag and just pick it up when you need it."
How do computers restart?,"The computer is basically a large collection of switches and wires. When you press the power button, the switch is turned on, and the wires start to flow with electricity.

How does schizophrenia develop and what exactly does it do to the brain?," Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in motivation, pleasure, and reward. It is released in response to rewarding stimuli, such as food, sex, and social interaction. This release of dopamine reinforces certain behaviors, making them more likely to occur in the future. For example, when you eat food, dopamine is released in your brain, making you more likely to eat food in the future. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by a lack of motivation and pleasure. In order to understand how this disorder develops, we must first understand the role of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is released in response to rewarding stimuli, and it reinforces certain behaviors. This means that if you are rewarded for a behavior, you are more likely to perform that behavior in the future. However, if you are not rewarded for a behavior, you are less likely to perform that behavior in the future. In schizophrenia, there is a lack of dopamine release in response to rewarding stimuli. This means that you are less likely to be motivated to perform behaviors that are rewarding, and therefore, you are less likely to perform behaviors that are rewarding.  "
How does the cord of my earphones get all tangled up in several impossible knots?,"The cord is made up of a bunch of tiny strings that are all tangled up in a way that looks like it would be impossible to untangle. When you pull on the cord, the tangled strings are stretched out and untangled, and then tangled up again. The tangled string thing is called a ""topological knot"" and is a field of study. I have a friend who works on it. I'll see if I can get him to ELI5 it."

"In movie/tv scenes where ""animals were not harmed"", how do they show the animals being harmed when not using cgi ?","You know when you're watching a movie and you see a scene where an actor is getting hit by something, and it looks like they're getting hit by something? Well, that's usually not what's actually happening. What's happening is that the camera is taking a picture of something else, like a hammer, and then superimposing it onto the actor. It's called ""blue screening"" or ""chroma keying"". It's a technique that's been used for decades. When you're filming an actor, you film them on a blue screen. You then film the scene, and then you add a blue screen behind the actor, and then you replace the blue screen with the real background. When you're filming an animal, you film it on a blue screen too. When you're filming a person, you film them on a blue screen, and then you replace the blue screen with a real background."
How do Internet Routers transmit data from a PC through their device and then to the internet?,"The router acts as a middleman, taking the data from the computer and sending it to the internet, and vice versa. The router is connected to the internet via a modem, which is a device that translates the digital data from the computer into analog signals that the internet can understand. The router then takes the data from the computer and sends it to the modem, which then sends it out to the internet. The router is also connected to the computer, so it can receive data from the internet and send it to the computer."
"why is it in northern states (US) it can snow several feet and daily life doesn't change, but in southern states ~1 inch of snow can shut everything down?","The northern states are used to it. They have a different mindset and are better prepared for it. In the south, the people are used to warm weather and don’t have the same mindset as the northern states. They also don’t have the same infrastructure. For example, the roads are not built for snow. In the north, the roads are built to withstand the cold and snow. The south has to shut down because they don’t have the infrastructure to handle it. The northern states have a much more robust infrastructure that can handle snow.   robust and resilient culture.

Why do some people feel slow and negative in the mornings while others are energetic and positive?,"The human body has a circadian rhythm. This is the cycle of our body that tells us when to wake up, when to eat, when to sleep, and when to be awake. This is controlled by a part of our brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This part of the brain tells the rest of our body what time it is. It is controlled by the amount of light we get. In the summer, when the sun is out, we get a lot of light, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus tells us it is daytime, and we are awake. In the winter, when the sun is not out, we don't get a lot of light, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus tells us it is nighttime, and we are sleeping. In the morning, the light from the sun tells the suprachiasmatic nucleus it is daytime, and we are awake. So, some people wake up and feel positive, because they are getting the right amount of light. Other people wake up, and they don't get enough light, so they don't feel positive. This is why some people wake up early and feel great, while other people wake up late and feel like crap."

how are cured meats made? What makes them edible?,"Cured meats are meats that have been preserved with salt, and sometimes other ingredients like sugar, spices, or alcohol. Salt works by drawing out the water in the meat, which makes it more difficult for bacteria to grow. The salt also helps to preserve the flavor of the meat. Cured meats are made by first cutting the meat into small pieces, then soaking it in a brine solution made with salt, water, and sometimes sugar and spices.   to keep it fresh. After the meat has been cured, it is dried in a cool, well-ventilated area. This helps to remove excess moisture from the meat, which makes it easier to store and transport. The final step in making cured meats is to add flavorings like spices, herbs, or other seasonings. This is done by mixing the flavorings with the cured meat, and then letting it sit for a few more days before it is packaged and sold. Cured meats are made by first cutting the meat into small pieces, then soaking it in a brine solution made with salt, water, and sometimes sugar and spices.  "
Can everyone theoretically have the same standard of living as people in first world countries?,"Not really. The first world countries are rich because they have a lot of people who are rich. If you take a random person from the US and compare them to a random person from a poorer country, the first world person will be richer. But if you take a random person from the US and compare them to a random person from another rich country, the difference is smaller. In order to have a similar standard of living, you'd need to have a similar number of rich people. The number of rich people is determined by the economy. A country that has a lot of rich people has a strong economy. A country that has a lot of poor people has a weak economy. The only way to have a strong economy is to have a good government. A good government is one that is stable, that has a good rule of law, and that is good at collecting taxes. If you have a bad government, you have a weak economy. A weak economy means that there are fewer rich people. A weak economy means that there are fewer rich people.   rich people.   rich people.   rich people.   rich people.   rich people.   rich people.   rich people.   rich people.  "
Why are southern Californian counties so large compared to northern Californian counties?,"'Because we have more people and more land to cover.' That's not the answer you're looking for. California is divided into 58 counties, and they are all different sizes. It's like asking why the counties in Florida are so different in size. The answer is that the counties were created by the state legislature, and they were created to be as big as possible. In the 19th century, California was a very sparsely populated state. The population was mostly concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, and the rest of the state was pretty much empty. The state legislature decided to create counties in an effort to govern the state better, and they decided that counties should be as big as possible. That way, the state could be governed more efficiently, and people could be better represented. The state legislature didn't care about the size of the counties, they just wanted to make sure that the counties were big enough to be able to govern themselves. There were no cities in the state, so there were no urban areas to worry about. The state legislature didn't want to create cities, because they were worried that cities would be too powerful, and would not be subject to the state government. So, they decided to create counties, and make them as big as possible.  "

Why is war not a war crime? Where do you draw the line? Torture? Mustard gas? Why not killing? Nukes?,"Is it just because of the sheer scale of the killing? Why do you think that killing is not a war crime?
 (Note: I am not an expert on this topic) I've always thought that it's not so much about the act itself, but about the intent. In other words, a war crime is a crime that is committed in a war, but it's not necessarily a crime committed by a soldier or a military. A war crime is committed by someone who is not a soldier or a member of the military, but who is actively engaged in the war. For example, a civilian who is part of a rebel group, or a mercenary who is hired to fight for one side. So, if someone is a civilian and is killed in war, that's not a war crime. If a soldier is killed in war, that's not a war crime. But if a civilian is killed in war, and it's done with the intention of harming the civilian, then it's a war crime. In the same way, if a soldier is killed in war, and it's done with the intention of harming the soldier, then it's a war crime. It's important to note that war crimes are not limited to physical acts of violence.  "
"When there's a salmonella outbreak, how is it determined which single product is responsible?","When you're tired, you're probably running on a combination of stored energy (fat) and the energy you've used up in the day. When you rest, you're giving your body a chance to recharge its energy stores. When you're feeling better after a long rest, it's likely that your energy stores have been replenished. When you're feeling worse, it's likely that your energy stores have been depleted, and you're now relying on stored energy (fat) to keep you going. If you're eating a lot of sugar, and you're not burning off enough energy through exercise, then you'll be burning off stored fat for energy, which is a very slow process. So you'll feel worse, because you're relying on fat for energy. If you're eating a lot of protein, and you're not burning off enough energy through exercise, then you'll be burning off stored fat for energy, which is a very slow process. So you'll feel worse, because you're relying on fat for energy.  "
Where did the thought of mice loving cheese come from?,"The brain is a very complex system. There are a few different ways the brain can know what to eat and what to avoid. The first is through taste. The taste buds are a very important part of the mouth that can tell you what foods are safe to eat. If you eat something that is not safe, it can cause your taste buds to not work as well. The second is through smell. Your brain can tell you what foods are safe to eat through smell. The third is through the lining of the stomach. The lining of the stomach has special cells that can tell your brain what foods are safe to eat. The fourth is through the intestines. The intestines have special cells that can tell your brain what foods are safe to eat. The fifth is through the brain. The brain can tell you what foods are safe to eat by looking at the food and deciding if it is safe to eat. The last is through the body. The body can tell you what foods are safe to eat through the senses of the body. The senses of the body can tell you what foods are safe to eat."
why when you put a wooden spoon across a pot does the water not boil over?,"It's called the [boiling point]( URL_0 ) and is a property of water. The boiling point is the temperature at which the liquid will start to boil and turn into steam. If you're at a higher elevation the boiling point of water will be lower. When you put a spoon across the pot, the spoon acts as a barrier. The water is not able to boil over because there is a barrier that is preventing it."
How can we recycle urine and get it back to clean drinking water?,"The main problem with urine is the nitrogen content.

How does terminal Velocity work?,"Terminal velocity is the point at which you reach maximum speed. When you are falling, your speed is determined by the force of gravity and the force of air resistance. When the force of gravity is stronger than the force of air resistance, you will continue to fall at a constant speed, which is called terminal velocity. When the force of gravity is weaker than the force of air resistance, you will accelerate downward, and when the force of gravity is stronger than the force of air resistance, you will slow down and eventually stop."

"How do we connect a prosthetic limb so that it can ""feel""?"," tl;dr: we use the nerves that are still intact in the limb to connect the prosthetic limb to the brain. I'm not a neurologist, but I'll try to explain it in a way that's easy to understand. The brain sends signals to the muscles of the body to control movement. In order to control a prosthetic limb, we need to send signals from the brain to the prosthetic limb. We can do this using nerves. Nerves are like wires that connect the brain to the rest of the body. We can use the nerves that are still intact in the limb to connect the prosthetic limb to the brain. When you want to move your arm, your brain sends a signal to the nerves in your arm, and those nerves send signals to the muscles in your arm. We can do the same thing with a prosthetic limb. We use the nerves that are still intact in the limb to connect the prosthetic limb to the brain. We can use the same nerves that control the prosthetic limb to control the muscles in the prosthetic limb. We can also use sensors to detect what's going on in the prosthetic limb and send that information to the brain.  "
How does standard deviation work,"Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out a set of data is. It measures how much the average is deviating from the mean. If the mean is 100, and the standard deviation is 10, then the average is only 10% away from the mean. If the standard deviation is 100, then the average is only 1% away from the mean. Standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance of the data."
Why does hot water freeze faster than cold water?,"Because the water molecules are moving faster in the hot water and thus have more energy to do work. In order to freeze, water molecules must have enough energy to overcome the energy barrier that keeps them moving. So, if you have hot water, the water molecules have more energy and can overcome the energy barrier more easily. The molecules in the cold water are moving slower, so they don't have enough energy to overcome the energy barrier."
why we don't have a world wide credibility rating for every public figure/platform ?,"Credibility rating is more of a measure of how trustworthy the person is, while reputation rating is more of a measure of how popular the person is. Credibility ratings are often used by companies to measure the credibility of a person or organization. Reputation ratings are often used by companies to measure the reputation of a person or organization. A reputation rating is a measure of how well a person or organization is perceived by the public. A credibility rating is a measure of how well a person or organization is perceived by the public, and how well they adhere to the standards of their profession."
Why do hot steam (from hot springs/hot shower) feel suffocating even though water is made of hydrogen and oxygen molecules?,"Hot steam is essentially water vapor. When you breathe in water vapor, it doesn’t actually feel like you’re breathing in water, it just feels like you’re breathing in air. That’s because the water vapor is actually just water in a gas state. Water vapor is made up of the same basic elements as water. The only difference is that it’s in a gas state instead of a liquid state. So, when you breathe in water vapor, it’s not like you’re actually breathing in water, it’s just like you’re breathing in air. So, when you breathe in hot steam, you’re basically just breathing in hot air."

why do some shots get injected into the vein while others are put into muscles?,"The site of injection matters, the muscle is a good place to inject things. The vein is a bad place to inject things. The vein is a blood vessel, it’s a passageway for blood to go from the heart to the rest of the body. The vein is a very small diameter tube, so it’s not good to put a large amount of liquid into it.   the vein, it’s going to go right back to the heart and be pumped into the rest of the body.

Why are even numbered houses on one side of the road and odd on the other?,"Odd numbers are on the right and even numbers are on the left. This is so that if you are driving on the right side of the road and you see a house with a number on it, you can tell if it is odd or even just by looking at the number. If it is odd, it is on the right, if it is even it is on the left. The odd numbers are on the right and the even numbers are on the left. This is because the numbering starts at 1 on the left and goes to the right.  0 on the left and went to the right, the odd numbers would be on the left and the even numbers would be on the right.  0 on the right and went to the left, the odd numbers would be on the right and the even numbers would be on the left.  0 on the right and went to the left, the odd numbers would be on the left and the even numbers would be on the right.  0 on the left and went to the right, the odd numbers would be on the right and the even numbers would be on the left.  0 on the left and went to the right, the odd numbers would be on the right and the even numbers would be on the left.

What exactly happened to make Julian Assange and Wikileaks go from loved to hated?,"[Wikileaks]( URL_0 ) is a website that publishes documents that have been leaked to them by anonymous sources. The site was launched in 2006 and was initially very popular. However, the site became controversial after it published the [Afghan War Diary]( URL_1 ), a series of documents that exposed the US military's actions in Afghanistan. The documents showed that US soldiers had killed hundreds of civilians, including women and children, and that the US military had been involved in torture, abuse, and murder. The documents were leaked by Chelsea Manning, who was later convicted of espionage and sentenced to 35 years in prison. After the Afghan War Diary was published, the site became more controversial, and it was accused of being a propaganda outlet for the Russian government. In 2010, Wikileaks published a series of documents about the Iraq War, which were leaked by an Iraqi army officer. The documents showed that US soldiers had been involved in torture and abuse, and that the US government had been involved in a cover-up. In 2011, Wikileaks published a series of documents about the US diplomatic cables, which were leaked by a former CIA employee.  "
How did humans get to North America if life started in Africa and there were no boats back then?," We do not know for sure how humans got to North America. However, there are several theories. The most popular theory is that humans came to North America from Asia via the Bering Strait land bridge. This land bridge was created by the melting of the last ice age. Humans migrated to the Americas about 15,000 years ago. Humans came to North America via the Bering Strait land bridge. Humans migrated to the Americas about 15,000 years ago.

"how do touch screens work that they can be manipulated by my hand, but not accidentally by my sleeve?","When you touch the screen, the capacitance changes, and this change is detected by the capacitance sensor. The capacitance sensor is a capacitor that is made up of two electrodes separated by a small gap. The electrodes are usually made of metal and are coated with a thin layer of a conductive material, like a metal oxide. When you touch the screen, the electrodes sense the change in capacitance. The capacitance sensor is connected to the processor, and the processor calculates the change in capacitance and compares it to a threshold value. If the change in capacitance exceeds the threshold value, the processor determines that the capacitance sensor has been touched. The threshold value is set by the manufacturer and can be changed by the user. The threshold value is set to be just high enough so that the capacitance sensor will detect touches, but not so high that it will not detect accidental touches. The capacitance sensor is also connected to the power supply, and when the processor detects a touch, it turns on the power supply and sends a signal to the processor. The processor then sends a signal to the display controller, which changes the display on the screen to reflect the touch. The display controller is connected to the display and changes the display by sending a signal to the display.  "
What does the mandelbrot set have to do with chaos theory?," rot set is a mathematical set of points that are defined by a formula. The formula is given by z^2 + c = 0, where z is a complex number (a + bi). The point (a,b) is in the Mandelbrot set if it satisfies the equation. The set is named after the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who first discovered it in 1979.  rot set is interesting because it has an infinite number of points in it, but the number of points grows very slowly. This is unusual because most mathematical objects have a finite number of points.  rot set is also interesting because of its fractal structure. A fractal is a geometric object that has a pattern that repeats over and over again at smaller and smaller scales.  rot set has a fractal structure because it has a pattern that repeats over and over again. The pattern is a spiral that grows smaller and smaller.  rot set is also interesting because it has a property called self-similarity. Self-similarity is a property where an object has the same pattern repeated over and over again at different scales.  rot set has this property because it has a pattern that repeats over and over again at different scales.

"When you hear of political protests around the world why is it so often ""student protesters"" who are involved?",Because the students are the ones who are most likely to be able to protest without fear of reprisal. They are also the ones who are most likely to be passionate about the cause. They are also the ones who are most likely to be able to organize and mobilize other students. And they are also the ones who are most likely to be able to get away with breaking the rules of the school.
"What is the logic behind the terms ""Low Skill Floor"" and ""High Skill Floor""?","The term ""Skill floor"" refers to the level of difficulty a person must achieve in order to perform a certain task. It is often used in reference to programming, where the skill floor is the level of difficulty that must be achieved in order to write a certain piece of code. The logic behind the terms ""Low Skill Floor"" and ""High Skill Floor"" is that the higher the skill floor, the more difficult it is to perform the task. A low skill floor means that the task is relatively easy to perform, and that not much skill is required. A high skill floor means that the task is very difficult, and that a lot of skill is required to perform it."
"If I have a source of light like a flashlight in a dark room, how can I see things that, when the light beam bounces off them, it doesn't reach my eyes?","Your eyes are sensitive to light, but not to the wavelength of the light. The light from the flashlight has a wavelength that your eyes can detect. But your eyes can also detect the wavelengths of things that are not light. For example, your eyes can detect radio waves, and your ears can detect sound waves. In this case, you can use the sound waves that bounce off the objects in the dark room to detect them."

"How the ""helicopter effect"" happens in a car when you have a window open.","When you put your hand on the roof of a car, you are feeling the air pressure inside the car, which is lower than the air pressure outside the car. The difference in pressure is what makes the car feel like it's lifting off the ground. This is similar to the pressure difference that causes airplanes to fly."
"Why does hot chocolate have a drinkability window of about 20 seconds; whereas, it seems like coffee stays the perfect temperature for much much longer?","It's a chemical reaction. The cocoa butter in the hot chocolate is a fat, and it doesn't mix with water very well. So, when you stir it, it separates into a layer of fat on top, and a layer of liquid underneath. The fat layer is the creamy, smooth part that you like, but the liquid layer is the watery, not-so-smooth part. This is why it's best to drink hot chocolate when it's just hot enough, and not too hot. If you wait too long, the fat layer will separate too much, and the drink will be too watery. This is also why it's best to drink hot chocolate with milk, because the milk helps to mix the two layers together. This is why the drinkability window of hot chocolate is about 20 seconds, because if you wait too long, the drink will be too watery. Coffee doesn't have this problem, because the fat layer in coffee is very thin, so it mixes well with the water. This is why you can drink coffee all day long without it getting too watery."

"How is a piece of software like ""Scan/Check Disk"" able to fix a piece of hardware being your ""Hard Drive""? What is going on behind the scenes here and why can't the OS just fix these errors on-the-fly?","You're confusing two things here. The operating system can fix errors on the fly, but it can only do that for errors that are in RAM. The hard drive is a different beast entirely. It has its own memory, and it stores data on a physical disk. The operating system can't fix errors on the fly because it doesn't have direct access to the hard drive. It can only tell the hard drive to run a check disk, and the hard drive will then run the check disk. The check disk is a program that looks at the hard drive and reports any errors that it finds. It can also fix errors if it's able to do so. So the operating system tells the hard drive to run the check disk, the hard drive runs the check disk, and then the operating system can tell the hard drive to fix any errors it found."
"Why are eggs in the US refrigerated in grocery stores, but in other places (for example, Panama) eggs are simply on a room-temp shelf?","The US has a very high rate of Salmonella in eggs, so the eggs are refrigerated to slow the growth of bacteria.

How does far infrared radiation help humans heal/recover?," 🤔💭 We all know that the sun’s rays are essential for our survival, and it’s also a known fact that far infrared radiation is the most abundant form of radiation on earth. The sun’s rays are composed of a combination of visible light and infrared radiation. The visible light is what we see, and the infrared radiation is what we can’t see. It’s also known as heat. When the sun’s rays reach earth, it absorbs the visible light, but the infrared radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs the infrared radiation and then emits it back to earth. The infrared radiation is essential for the survival of all living things on earth.   infrared radiation has healing properties. It’s a non-invasive, pain-free, and a natural healing process.   infrared radiation can penetrate deep into the body.   infrared radiation can increase the circulation of blood in the body.   infrared radiation can reduce inflammation and pain in the body.   infrared radiation can reduce stress and improve sleep.

"Why do most international fast food chains offer some menu items that are exclusive to one region/country, and are not available at all participating locations worldwide?"," I think the answer is because of the differences in food culture, regulations and availability of ingredients. For example, McDonald's in Japan sells a burger with a fried egg and bacon, which is not available in the US. Burger King in India has a vegetarian version of their Whopper sandwich. This is because India is a predominantly vegetarian country, and they have to cater to that. Pizza Hut in the US has a pizza with a pepperoni crust, which is not available anywhere else. This is because pepperoni is a popular ingredient in the US, but it's not commonly available in many other countries. In the UK, Pizza Hut has a pizza with chicken tikka masala sauce, which is not available in the US. This is because chicken tikka masala is a popular dish in the UK, but it's not commonly available in the US. McDonald's in Japan has a salad with fried chicken, which is not available in the US. This is because Japan has a strong culture of eating salads, and fried chicken is not a popular ingredient in the US. In the US, McDonald's has a sandwich with a fried egg and bacon, which is not available in Japan.  "

Why are all our emotions stronger at night than during the day?,"The reason why emotions are stronger at night is because of the increase in the production of the hormone cortisol, which is associated with stress and anxiety. Cortisol is produced in response to the decrease in light, which is what causes us to feel tired. The body responds to the decrease in light by producing more cortisol. This is why people tend to feel more anxious and stressed at night, and why people with anxiety disorders have more intense symptoms at night."
"In images of the human body, there are veins that appear to branch off of arteries and other veins that appear to just end. Where does the blood go?","Blood is constantly flowing and being replenished. When a vein is full, it sends that blood to a capillary, which is a tiny tube that is one cell thick. The capillary is where oxygen and nutrients are released into the blood and carbon dioxide is removed. Then the blood goes to the next vein and the process starts again. The heart is constantly pumping and replenishing the blood. It is also constantly receiving oxygen and nutrients from the lungs."
Microwaves,"are a form of electromagnetic radiation, and can be used to heat food.... but they can also cause your food to become radioactive. There are two main ways that microwaves can cause your food to become radioactive. The first is through the process of ionization, which is when the microwaves cause the water molecules in your food to break apart and release their electrons. This creates charged particles that can interact with other particles in your food, potentially causing them to become radioactive. The second way that microwaves can cause your food to become radioactive is through the process of nuclear fission. This is when the microwaves cause the atoms in your food to split into smaller particles, which can potentially create radioactive byproducts. This is a very rare occurrence, and only happens with very high levels of microwave radiation. However, there is evidence that microwaves can cause cancer in animals, and it is suspected that they may also cause cancer in humans."
How does Chemotherapy work?,"Chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer. Cancer is a disease where cells in your body start to grow and divide without stopping. They can also start to invade other parts of your body. Chemotherapy works by using drugs that stop the cancer cells from growing and dividing. These drugs are usually given by a needle or a pump.  gs are put into your bloodstream, where they travel to the cancer cells and stop them from growing and dividing. There are many different types of chemotherapy drugs. Some drugs work by killing the cancer cells. Others work by stopping the cancer cells from dividing. Some drugs work by stopping the blood supply to the cancer cells. Other drugs work by making the cancer cells more visible to the immune system. The immune system is like a security system that fights infections and diseases. When chemotherapy drugs are given to a patient, the drugs are usually given in cycles. This means that the patient will get the drugs for a few days, and then they will stop for a few days. The cycle is repeated several times.  gs can be given by a machine that pumps the drugs into a tube that goes into the patient’s arm.  gs can also be given through a vein in the patient’s neck.  "
Why do people stop using 5 point harness safety belts in cars once they're older?," The five-point harness has been around for decades. It is a seatbelt with a shoulder strap, two lap straps, and a chest strap. It was invented to provide better safety in car crashes. The five-point harness is still used in some cars today, but it has largely been replaced by the three-point seatbelt in most modern cars. Why is that? There are several reasons why the three-point seatbelt has replaced the five-point harness. The three-point seatbelt is more comfortable. It is easier to put on and take off, and it is less likely to get tangled up or caught on something. It is also more flexible, so it can move with your body. The three-point seatbelt is also easier to use in a crash. It is designed to pull you back into the seat and away from the airbag. The three-point seatbelt also provides better protection in a side impact. It can keep you from being thrown from the car. The three-point seatbelt is also less expensive to make.

How do meteorologists estimate the inches of expected snowfall in a given area?,"Mostly they use a combination of weather models and observations. Weather models are like a series of computers that try to predict the weather. They use past weather data and current weather data to make predictions. Observations are like the weather data. They use weather balloons, radar, and other stuff to measure the weather. The models use the observations to make predictions. The predictions are then combined into an estimate."
Why can phones make such a loud noise for an amber alert? Why can't they normally go this loud?,"A cell phone is a radio transmitter. It is designed to send radio waves out to a cell tower. The cell tower then sends the radio waves to other cell towers and eventually to the user. The cell tower is designed to be able to receive a signal from the phone, but it is not designed to be able to transmit to the phone. The reason that a cell phone can make such a loud noise is because the cell tower has a very powerful transmitter. The cell tower is designed to be able to transmit radio waves to many phones at the same time. When the cell tower needs to send a message to the phone, it uses a lot of power to do so.

How does a digital timetable display know how far away a train is?,"There are two types of train timetables. One is the schedule which shows the arrival and departure times of trains at each station. The other is the real-time information which shows the current status of trains. The real-time information is generated by the train company’s system and it is usually displayed at each station or on the train. The real-time information system uses GPS (Global Positioning System) to track the location of the train. The GPS system is installed in the train and it sends information to the system on the train’s location. The system then calculates the time it will take to reach the next station and it displays it on the real-time information display. The schedule system uses the same GPS system to calculate the arrival and departure times of trains. However, it also considers other factors such as the number of passengers and the number of trains on the track. It then calculates the time it will take for each train to reach each station and it displays it on the schedule. The real-time information system is usually updated every 10 minutes.

Why do some foods taste better when reheated than they do when fresh from the oven? (like Lasagne),"Because you're using the same heat that cooked the food to reheat it. The heat from the oven/grill/stove is not just for cooking, it also helps to preserve food by killing off any bacteria that may have grown in it. When you reheat something, you're essentially cooking it again, and the heat from the oven/grill/stove is what kills off any bacteria that may have grown on it. This is why you can't reheat some foods, like raw meat, because the heat will kill off the bacteria that is needed to make it safe to eat."

"Why do distant lights appear to ""shimmer""?"," In physics, the phenomenon is called ""diffraction"". Diffraction is the bending of light around an obstacle, and the phenomenon is a result of the light waves interacting with each other. The wavelength of the light is what causes the diffraction. In physics, the wavelength of light is a measure of how much space a light wave travels through in one second. The longer the wavelength, the shorter the distance the light wave travels. The longer the wavelength, the shorter the distance the light wave travels. The longer the wavelength, the more space the light wave can bend."

"Why can you hear the voices in the apartment above you so easily, but not the voices in the apartment below you?","The sound of your voice is carried by the air molecules that make up the atmosphere. The molecules have a certain amount of energy that they can transfer to the sound waves, and the strength of that transfer depends on the distance between the sound source and the listener. The molecules from the floor below you have to travel a longer distance to reach you, so they have less energy to transfer, and your voice is less loud."

Why do bread items always heat up so quickly in the microwave compared to any other food item?,"Hey /u/CodingNinja! I'm a physics student at the University of Texas at Austin and I have a lot of knowledge about this topic. So, it's actually pretty simple. The reason why bread heats up so quickly is because it has a lot of water inside it. Water is a very good conductor of heat, which means that it can quickly transfer heat from the microwaves to the bread. Other food items don't have as much water inside them, which means that they don't absorb heat as quickly. It's not just bread that heats up quickly, though. Other foods that have a lot of water in them, like potatoes or carrots, also heat up quickly in the microwave. This is because the water inside them is a good conductor of heat, just like in bread. Other foods that don't have as much water inside them, like meats or vegetables, don't heat up as quickly. This is because they don't have as much water inside them, which means that they don't have as much of a conductor of heat. When you microwave a piece of bread, the microwaves hit the water inside the bread and cause it to heat up. This heat is then transferred to the rest of the bread, causing it to heat up as well. This is why bread heats up so quickly.  "
Why does a weak am/fm radio signal result in a consistent static/fuzzy sound while a weak satellite radio signal results in intermittent high quality sound?,"Ъ��� 1. AM/FM signals are transmitted through the air. Satellite signals are transmitted from a satellite in orbit. The satellite signal has to travel through the atmosphere which can cause degradation of the signal. The atmosphere is like a big blanket of air. When you throw a ball in the air, it doesn't just keep going straight, it bounces off the atmosphere. This is because the atmosphere is like a big blanket of air. It slows down the ball. So when you throw a ball, it doesn't go straight to the ground, it goes up and then down. It bounces off the atmosphere. This is why the ball doesn't go straight to the ground. It goes up and then down. The ball goes up and then down because it bounces off the atmosphere. The same thing happens to radio signals. The atmosphere slows down the signal. This is why the signal goes up and then down. This is why the signal is fuzzy. 2. The atmosphere is like a big blanket of air. It is made up of lots of tiny molecules. The molecules are like tiny little balls. They are all bouncing around. They are bouncing off each other. They are bouncing off the ground. They are bouncing off the walls.

Why does Greenland have more Ice than Iceland and vice-versa? [Other],"  Greenland has more ice because the ice is more stable and less subject to melting due to its location. Greenland is located in the Arctic Ocean, where it is surrounded by cold seas. Iceland is located in the North Atlantic, where it is surrounded by warmer seas. This means that Iceland gets a lot more rainfall than Greenland. The ice in Greenland is also more stable because it is more compacted and less subject to melting. Iceland's ice is more prone to melting because it is less compacted. Also, Iceland is much more mountainous than Greenland, which means that more of Iceland's ice is located in the mountains. This makes it more prone to melting."
"What causes the ""hairs on the back of your neck to stand up"" feeling, even when just imagining/reading something scary.","Painful to try and explain, but I'll give it a shot. The hairs on the back of your neck are called vibrissae, and they serve a very important purpose. Vibrissae are hairs that are very sensitive to touch and are used to detect very subtle changes in temperature, texture, and pressure. They are also very sensitive to movement and are used to detect movement in the environment. So, when you are feeling scared, your brain is sending signals to your vibrissae to detect any subtle changes in temperature or pressure that may indicate danger. This is why you feel your hairs stand up on the back of your neck.   your body's way of saying ""Hey, something's not right here, we need to be more vigilant."" Your brain is also sending signals to your muscles to tense up, so that you are better prepared to fight or run away from the danger.   your body's way of saying ""Hey, we need to be ready to fight or run away from this danger."" The other reason that you feel your hairs stand up on the back of your neck is because your brain is sending signals to your vibrissae to detect any changes in the environment. This is why you feel your hairs stand up on the back of your neck when you are in a dark room or when you hear a strange noise.  "
- Why is it that after a night out drinking people often wake up relatively early and refreshed?,"I’m a sleep researcher, so I’ll give you the short answer, and then the long answer. Short answer: Because the brain is programmed to wake up after a night of drinking, so it’s not a surprise that it wakes you up. Long answer: First, let me say that I don’t drink, so I’m not going to talk about why I wake up after a night of drinking, because I don’t. But let me tell you, I’ve heard many people say that they wake up after a night of drinking feeling refreshed, and I think that’s really interesting. So, why do people wake up feeling refreshed? Well, one reason is that drinking alcohol is a depressant, which means that it slows down the brain’s activity. So, when people drink, they tend to fall asleep faster, and stay asleep longer. This is why alcohol is often used as a sleep aid. But, when you drink, your brain is also sending signals to your body to wake up. So, the brain is trying to make you sleep, but it’s also trying to wake you up. This is why people often wake up after a night of drinking, even though they’re tired.  "
How did banks keep track of legitimate withdrawals before the electronic age?,"Before electronic banking, people would write a check. The check would be drawn on the bank, and it would be made out to the person the person wanted to pay. The check would have the amount of money being paid, and the name of the person it was being paid to. The person would then give the check to the person they wanted to pay, who would then take the check to their bank to cash it. The bank would then verify that the person had the money in their account, and that the check was valid. If everything was good, the bank would give the person the money. If the check was bad, the bank would not give the person the money. The bank would then keep the check, and send it back to the bank that the check was drawn on."

They are electrical impulses that travel through the nerves, and they are different from the electricity that flows through the wires in your house. Electricity is a flow of electrons, and it can't travel through nerves. Nerve signals are a different thing, and they are made up of chemicals that are released from the nerves. These chemicals bind to other nerves, and they are how the nerves communicate with each other. They are not electricity, and they can't travel through wires."
Why does Pi have infinite digits?,"It's a mathematical constant, not a function. Pi is defined as 3.14159... etc. and is the ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle. It is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction. The reason for this is that the decimal representation of Pi is infinite and non-repeating. This means that there is no way to write down the decimal representation of Pi in a finite number of digits. There are infinitely many digits in the decimal representation of Pi, and they are all different."
Why the definition of an integer is independent of the number base used?,"Integers are numbers that are unchanged when you add them to their own negative. For example, -2 + -2 = 0. This means that the number -2 is not a fraction, and can be expressed as a whole number. The number base is how we represent numbers. We can represent numbers using 0 and 1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 7, 8 and 9, 10 and 11, 12 and 13, and so on. Each number base has its own way of writing numbers, and its own way of doing arithmetic. For example, 10 in base 10 is written as 10, and 10 in base 2 is written as 1010. In base 10, 10 + 10 = 20. In base 2, 10 + 10 = 1010. The way we do arithmetic in a given base is based on the number of digits in the base. For example, in base 10, we do addition by adding the digits. In base 2, we do addition by adding the digits, but we do multiplication by adding the digits twice. In base 3, we do addition by adding the digits, and multiplication by adding the digits twice.  "
Why cold Surfaces stop the tingling feeling in your hand,"The cold surface doesn't stop the tingling sensation, but the cold air does.

"What causes that ""sick"" feeling when you see your crush with someone else?","The body has a system of checks and balances. When you eat, your body will tell you that you are full. This is a signal to stop eating. When you don't listen to that signal, you are putting pressure on your body. Your body will try to fight that pressure, but eventually it will succumb. When you eat too much, your body can't handle the pressure, and your body will start to shut down. This is why it is important to listen to your body. If you are hungry, eat. If you are full, stop eating. If you don't listen to your body, you will eventually get sick."

What is that 'beep' sound that submarines make in movies ?,"The ""beep"" sound is called a ""pulsed signal."" It is a simple way to transmit a message over a very long distance, even if the transmitter and receiver are separated by thousands of feet of water. The signal is generated by a device called a ""transducer,"" which is essentially a very powerful speaker that can be used to generate a very short, high-frequency signal. This signal is then sent through the water to the submarine, where it is received by a device called a ""hydrophone."" The hydrophone is essentially a very sensitive microphone that can detect even very small changes in the water pressure caused by the passing of the signal. The signal is then decoded by the submarine's computers, and the message is displayed on the submarine's control panel."

What is that whistling sound when an old TV turns on?," tl;dr: A TV's power supply whistles when it's not properly tuned to the voltage. The whistling is an indication of this, and it can be fixed by adjusting the power supply's tuning. A TV's power supply is responsible for providing power to all of the components in the TV, including the display, speakers, and internal circuitry. The power supply is typically an AC-DC converter, which converts the AC power from the wall outlet to DC power that the TV's components can use. The power supply also filters the AC power to ensure that it is free of noise and spikes. The power supply is typically tuned to provide a clean output, but sometimes it's not tuned properly. When this happens, the power supply can produce a whistling sound, which is an indication that the power supply needs to be adjusted. There are a few reasons why a power supply might produce a whistling sound. The most common reason is that the power supply is not properly tuned. The power supply has a filter in it that's designed to remove noise from the AC power, but sometimes the filter is not properly tuned, which can cause the power supply to produce a whistling sound. Another reason for the whistling sound is that the power supply is overheating.  "
"Why are some allergies so common, like peanuts?","So, I'm not a doctor, but I can give you a layman's explanation. Allergies are caused by your body recognizing something foreign. This can be caused by a number of things, including foods, medications, insect bites, etc. Your body is trying to protect you from things that can harm you, and in some cases, it will attack those things even if they are not actually harmful. Peanuts are one of the most common food allergies because they are so common and they are often introduced to babies early on in life. There are a number of different allergens in peanuts, which are the proteins that trigger the allergic reaction. Because peanuts are so common, many people are exposed to them at a young age, and so the allergies develop. The same goes for other common allergies, like milk and eggs."

What is the law/loophole that requires/allows North American TV advertisers to flash blocks of unreadable text at the bottom of their ads?,"It's a loophole that was created by the FCC in the 1970s. The idea was that if the text was unreadable, it wasn't an ad. The FCC created a set of rules for what makes text unreadable, which includes the size of the text, the color of the text, the brightness of the text, and the speed at which the text is displayed. If a TV station can't meet these rules, they have to put a message at the bottom of the screen. This is why you see the message ""This program is brought to you by"" or something similar at the bottom of the screen. This is a loophole that has been exploited by the advertising industry. The FCC has tried to close the loophole, but the industry has always found a way to exploit it."

How could the universe not be infinite?,"In the current understanding of the universe, it is infinite in size. It's not a question of how it could be infinite, but rather how it could be finite. There are a few different ways to explain how the universe could be finite. One of the most popular is the idea of the ""multiverse"". In this idea, the universe is just one of many universes. Each universe is separated from the others by a ""bubble wall"". The bubble walls are thought to be incredibly dense and hard to pass through, so the universes are effectively isolated from each other. The multiverse theory also suggests that the universe is finite in size. The idea is that the universe is a ""sphere"" of space, and that the bubble walls are just the ""edge"" of the sphere. Another theory is that the universe is a ""torus"". In this idea, the universe is a doughnut shaped sphere, and the bubble walls are just the ""edge"" of the doughnut. The universe is infinite in size. It is not a question of how it could be infinite, but rather how it could be finite."

How is the US Intellegence community fundamentally different from when they were so confident of WMD in Iraq?,"The brain is made up of billions of neurons, each of which is a specialized cell that has a specific function. The nervous system is a network of neurons and their connections, which is how the brain communicates with the rest of the body. Neurons communicate with each other using electrical impulses, and the brain and nervous system are essentially made up of billions of tiny electrical circuits. When you move, for example, your brain sends a signal down your spinal cord and into your muscles to make them contract. When you hear something, the brain sends a signal to your ears, and then sends another signal to your brain to interpret the sound."

"If I call a friend from far away, how does my call find it's way to his/her cellphone?","'I want to know how my call gets to my friend's cellphone. How does it get there? 'I am calling from far away. Is it a satellite? Does it go through the moon? What does it do? I am so confused' I would ask the friend. This is what you call a 'technical question' which is a question that requires some knowledge of how something works. It's a question that doesn't have an easy answer and requires some background knowledge. The answer would be: 'Well, it doesn't go through the moon. It goes through the cellphone network. It's like a big network of towers that talk to each other. It's like a big game of telephone. When you call me, my phone will talk to the tower nearest to me.

Why do far away things appear small?,"Because the distance from the viewer to the object is large, and the distance from the viewer to the object to the viewer's eyes is also large. The closer the object is to the viewer, the larger it appears. This is due to the way that our eyes work, and the way that the brain processes visual information. The brain has a special part called the ""fovea"" which is dedicated to processing the information from the center of the eye, and this is where the brain is most sensitive to the distance of an object. Objects which are closer to the viewer will appear larger than objects which are farther away, and this is why objects which are far away appear small."
Why do you get a headache the day after a night of crying?,"When you cry, your body releases chemicals to help you feel better. One of those chemicals is called prostaglandin.

Crying releases chemicals in your brain that can cause a headache. Crying also causes your blood vessels to dilate, which can also cause a headache."
Buddhism,"is a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of the Buddha, who was born in India around 563 BCE. [1] The word ""Buddha"" is Sanskrit for ""awakened one,"" and it refers to someone who has achieved a state of enlightenment or spiritual awakening.

The Pew Hispanic Center estimated that 75% of illegal immigrants are in the workforce, and 50% of them pay taxes. In 2012, the Heritage Foundation estimated that the total cost of illegal immigration was $34.9 billion. However, the Heritage Foundation also estimated that the cost of illegal immigration in 2010 was $21.3 billion, which is a 63% increase from 2009. There are many factors that could have contributed to this increase, including the fact that the number of illegal immigrants increased during that time period.

Why do so many people have a penicillin allergy during childhood?,"I think this is a very interesting question. I don't have a definitive answer, but I'll try to contribute to the discussion. I have a hypothesis that could be considered controversial. I believe that the reason why so many people have a penicillin allergy is because the immune system is not fully developed at birth. The immune system is highly mature in the womb, and after birth it starts to develop and mature, but it takes time. As the immune system is not fully developed, it is more susceptible to penicillin. I think that this is why the allergy is more common in children. Penicillin is used in the first year of life a lot. Children are exposed to it for a longer period of time than adults. This is why I think that the immune system is not fully developed. It is exposed to a lot of antigens, but it is not fully mature. I think that this is why the allergy is more common in children.

Why does the throat become so dry when laying in bed/sleeping?," Cause you are not breathing or swallowing as much, so the saliva production decreases. If you are in a dry environment you might also feel dry mouth. The dryness can also be caused by the position of the head and neck which causes the air flow to be blocked. I am not sure about the position, but I know that when I sleep on my side I feel my throat dry. I don't know if it's the same for everyone. It's because of your breathing. When you're sleeping, you're not breathing as much, and you're not swallowing as much. When you're breathing, you're taking in moisture from the air, and when you're swallowing, you're taking in moisture from the food you're eating. When you're sleeping, you're not doing either of those things as much, so your mouth and throat dry out."

I don’t think it’s a big deal, but it’s not where I’d put it. I’ve had patients ask to put it in their ear or on their neck. I’ve never really had to explain why I’m not doing that. I just tell them that it’s not the most accurate way to take a temperature. I do it on my arm. It’s the most common and most accurate way. I’m sure your doctor would be fine with it. It’s just a little more hassle. I have no idea why it’s not more common to take it on the arm. I’m sure it’s because it’s more comfortable for the patient. I’ve never had a patient ask me to do it on their arm."
"what is happening when we ""pop our knuckles""","Your joints are filled with a fluid called synovial fluid. This fluid is important for lubricating the joints and allowing them to move smoothly. When you crack your knuckles, you are creating a small amount of pressure in the joint, which causes the fluid to be forced out of the joint. As the fluid is forced out, the pressure in the joint is reduced, and the joint is able to move more easily. As you continue to crack your knuckles, you are creating a cycle of pressure and release, which causes the fluid to be repeatedly forced out of the joint."
Why do people sometimes get runny noses when they eat?," We don't know exactly. But it's probably because of something in the food that irritates the nerves in your nose. The nerves in your nose are connected to the nerves in your brain. When your brain gets a signal from your nose that something is irritating it, it tells your body to release mucus to try to protect your nose from whatever is irritating it."
"Why will the sun set 15 minutes later in two weeks, but only rise 6 minutes earlier?","The Earth's orbit is elliptical, meaning it's not a perfect circle. The Earth's closest point to the sun (called perihelion) is in January, and the Earth's farthest point is in July. When the Earth is closer to the sun, the sun seems brighter and the day is longer, and when it's farther away, the sun seems dimmer and the day is shorter. The Earth's orbit isn't perfectly circular, so the sun appears to move north or south depending on the time of year. The sun is also moving northward in its orbit, so it's closer to the Earth when the sun is overhead, and it's farther away when the sun is at the horizon. The sun will set 15 minutes later in two weeks because the Earth has moved northward in its orbit, so the sun is closer to the Earth when it's overhead. The sun will rise 6 minutes earlier in two weeks because the Earth has moved southward in its orbit, so the sun is farther away when it's overhead."

Why some drunks are mean and violent? What physiological/chemical change occurs in their body after they consume alcohol that makes them violent?,"I don't think it's fair to say that all drunks are mean and violent. But, if we're talking about alcohol-induced aggression, there are a few factors that can come into play. One is that alcohol can impair judgment and inhibitions. This means that a person may do things that they wouldn't normally do, which can lead to aggressive behavior. Another is that alcohol can impair motor control, which can lead to a person being more prone to accidents and injuries. In some cases, this can also lead to violent behavior. But, alcohol is also a depressant, which means that it can lower a person's inhibitions and make them more prone to aggressive behavior. Finally, there are some genetic factors that can influence a person's aggressive behavior. For example, some people have a genetic predisposition to aggression, which can be exacerbated by alcohol."

"How do they make bleach ""splash-less""","Bleach is a strong oxidizing agent and will react with anything it touches. The manufacturers of bleach have developed a formula that allows the bleach to be mixed with water, creating a solution that is stable enough to not splash, but still effective enough to do its job. The solution is stabilized by the addition of a small amount of water to the bleach. The bleach is then mixed with water in a controlled manner so that the ratio of bleach to water is the correct amount to create a stable solution. The solution is then packaged and sold as bleach. Bleach is made by mixing sodium hypochlorite with hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloric acid reacts with the sodium hypochlorite to produce chlorine gas. This gas is then dissolved in water and packaged."

"Why haven't we switched from copper to fiber for all our video and data connections (hdmi,DisplayPort, USB, etc)?","Cost. It's not just the cost of the cables themselves, but the cost of the switches and routers and other equipment that need to be replaced. It's also the cost of the time it takes to train people to use them and the cost of the time it takes to replace everything that uses copper. It's also the cost of the time it takes to design and build the fiber optic infrastructure. There are other limitations, but cost is the biggest one."
What exactly makes a mathematical argument 'rigorous'?," We often use the term ""rigorous"" when talking about mathematics. It means that the mathematical argument is very precise, very well defined, and very rigid. That is, if you follow the argument, it will always lead to the same conclusion, and you will always know that it is correct. But what does it mean to be rigorous? How do we know if a mathematical argument is rigorous? Let's start with a simple example. Consider the equation x + 1 = 2. This equation is very simple, and it's very easy to prove that it's true. But the proof is not rigorous, because it's not very precise. For example, we don't know exactly what the numbers x and 1 are. We just know that they are numbers, and we know that they add up to 2. But if we want to be rigorous, we need to be more precise.  "
How does electricity know not to go a route where it can't get back to the negative terminal?,"The electricity doesn't know. It just keeps flowing. The electrons that are flowing through the wire are just going along for the ride. They don't have any ""knowledge"" of where they are going or what they are doing. The only reason we can't get electricity back to the negative terminal is because it's just flowing through a wire and not a closed circuit."

"Why do we have to learn ""some"" things in school even though we wouldn't need/use it in the future?","I'll start with the fact that education is not just about learning to make a living. Education is about learning to be a responsible citizen and contributor to society. It's about learning how to think, not just what to think. It's about learning how to think critically, how to think creatively, how to think ethically, how to think about the world and the future.

"Why is there no ""Metric vs Imperial"" equivalent with how the world measures time?","I'm not an expert but I think it has to do with how we perceive time. We have a lot of natural rhythms that help us measure time, like the day and night, the seasons, the phases of the moon, the tides, the rotation of the earth, and the passage of the stars. We've also used sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and calendars to measure time. The only time we've ever really needed a unit of time was when we needed to coordinate things with other people, and that's when we invented seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. We've also invented time zones to coordinate things across different locations. I think that's why we've never really needed a standard unit of time, because we've always been able to use natural rhythms and human invention to measure time."
Voice Recognition,"is a technology that allows a computer to understand spoken words and transcribe them into text. . The technology has been around for a while and has been used in a variety of applications. One of the earliest and most well-known applications was the Dictation software that came with IBM's PC. This software allowed users to speak into the microphone on their PC and the text would be transcribed on the screen. This was useful for people who wanted to dictate documents or letters without having to type them out. The technology has advanced a lot since then and is now used in a variety of applications. One of the most common applications is voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. These are applications that can be activated by voice commands and perform a variety of tasks like setting reminders, sending messages, and playing music. Another application is voice recognition software that is used in call centers. This software allows call center operators to speak into a headset and the text is transcribed on the screen. This allows the operators to focus on the customer rather than typing out the conversation. The technology has also been used in a variety of other applications. For example, it is used in navigation systems to provide voice instructions. It is also used in medical transcription software to transcribe medical dictation. The technology is also used in a variety of security applications.  "
"Before I try making one, what's so bad about a cheesecake cracking?","The crust. If you use a cheesecake pan, you'll have a crust. It's fine if it's not a perfect crust, but if it's a bit too thin, it can crack. If you're using a springform pan, you can get around this by using a baking pan with a nonstick coating. This will allow the cheesecake to release from the pan without sticking to it. You can also use a silicone mat to line the springform pan. This will help prevent the cheesecake from sticking and allow it to release from the pan. If you're using a silicone mat, you can also use a spatula to remove the cheesecake from the pan. This will help you avoid the risk of cracking the crust."
Why does one get a weird and somewhat unusual feeling when coming back to their home after a long trip ?," PERCEPTION. The brain takes in a lot of sensory information and tries to make sense of it. When you get home, your brain is trying to make sense of all the new sensory information you are getting, and it is trying to compare it to the information it has stored. The information it is comparing it to is stored in your memories. When you go on a trip, your brain is taking in a lot of new information, and it is comparing it to the memories you have. If it doesn't find any matches, it will store the new information as a new memory. When you come back, your brain is comparing the new information it is taking in to the memories it has stored, and it is trying to make sense of it. Sometimes, the information it is comparing it to is not the information it should be.

Why are there so many different USB Cable connectors?,Because it's not just a USB connector. It's a USB connector that's also a USB-C connector. USB-C is a new connector standard that's supposed to replace all of the other connectors that are currently used for USB. It's smaller and reversible. That means you can plug it in either way. That's the same as the new Lightning connector used by Apple. It's reversible. So the USB-C connector is smaller and reversible. That means you can make a USB-C connector that's smaller than the current USB-A connector. But the USB-C connector is also the same as the USB-B connector. So you can make a USB-C connector that's the same size as the USB-B connector. That's why you see USB-C connectors that are the same size as USB-B connectors. They're not reversible. They're just the same size.

How are trade agreements like NAFTA and TPP considered bad deals for the U.S. Economy?,"Trade agreements are considered bad deals for the US economy when they allow for cheap foreign goods to be sold in the US and US goods to be sold cheaply in other countries. The problem is that the US is a very large country with a large economy and the US is a very large importer. Because the US imports so much, the US economy is highly dependent on cheap imports. This means that the US has a very weak manufacturing sector. The US has a very strong agricultural sector. The US has a very strong service sector. The US has a very weak manufacturing sector.

Where do currency symbols come from?," Currency symbols are based on the Latin script of the Greek alphabet. The Greeks had a symbol for money, and it was the letter delta (Δ). This is the same letter that the word ""delta"" comes from. This is where the modern currency symbol for the US dollar ($, or USD) comes from. The dollar sign is ₡, which is the symbol for the Greek letter delta (Δ). The dollar sign is derived from the Spanish dollar sign (₡), which was a symbol used to represent the Spanish dollar. The Spanish dollar was introduced in 1566 by the Spanish Empire, and it was used in the Americas. The dollar sign was used by the Spanish to represent the dollar, which was a unit of currency used in the Spanish Empire. The dollar sign was first used in the US in 1785, when the US adopted the dollar as its official currency. The dollar sign was used in the US until 1795, when the US adopted the dollar sign that is used today. The dollar sign is also known as the ""Greenback"" and it is the most widely used currency symbol in the world."
How are qubits more efficient than normal bits?,"A qubit is a quantum bit, a unit of information in quantum computing. Quantum bits are different from classical bits in that they can exist in multiple states simultaneously. In other words, a qubit can be 0 and 1 at the same time. This property is known as superposition, and it allows quantum computers to perform calculations much faster than classical computers. Quantum computers can perform calculations on multiple states simultaneously, whereas classical computers can only perform calculations on one state at a time. This means that quantum computers can perform calculations that are exponentially faster than classical computers. A classical computer can only perform one calculation at a time, so it can only perform one calculation in a second. A quantum computer can perform multiple calculations at the same time, so it can perform multiple calculations in a second. This means that a quantum computer can perform calculations that are exponentially faster than a classical computer. For example, a quantum computer can perform calculations on 2^1000 numbers at the same time, whereas a classical computer would take 1000 years to perform the same calculation."
Do viruses and bacteria have a colour?,"They don't have a color in the way we think of color. They are not made of pigments, and they don't reflect light in a way that we can see.

How are the brains of domesticated animals different from the brains of wild animals?,"Domesticated animals have a different brain structure than wild animals. Domesticated animals have a larger olfactory bulb, a larger hippocampus, and a smaller amygdala than wild animals. These are all important parts of the brain that are related to learning, memory, and emotions. Domesticated animals also have a different type of myelination, which is the insulation of nerve fibers. Wild animals have a more developed myelination, which allows them to process information faster. Domesticated animals have a more developed cerebral cortex, which is the part of the brain that is responsible for complex thinking and learning."
Why does your body temperature increase when you're nauseous and or vomiting?,"Because your body is trying to kill you. It's not actually trying to kill you, but it is trying to kill the bacteria that is making you sick. It's a self-defense mechanism. It's like your body is trying to cook the bacteria and kill it, but it's too much work so it just raises your temperature instead. Your body raises your temperature to kill the bacteria. It's a defense mechanism. You can also get a fever from other things, like a reaction to a vaccine."
"Why is it recommended that you replace your contact case every three months, instead of just disinfecting?","Your eyes can still get infected if they are exposed to the same bacteria multiple times. So even if you disinfect your contact case, the bacteria may still be there. In fact, it's more likely that you'll get a new infection than if you just replace your contact case. This is because when you disinfect your contact case, you're killing the bacteria on the surface. However, bacteria can still survive in the crevices of your contact case, and if you use your contacts again without replacing the case, those bacteria will grow and multiply. Replacing your contact case every three months will kill off any bacteria that are growing in the crevices, and will prevent you from getting a new infection."
How are hoarding and OCD related?,"OCD is a mental disorder that causes you to have persistent thoughts that you cannot control.

This is why the feet of birds are much warmer than the feet of mammals."
Would taking 2 hour naps throughout the day help as much as sleeping 8 hours at once ?,"This is a great question. The short answer is yes, but with a caveat. The caveat being that your body has a circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is an internal clock that tells you when it's time to be awake and when it's time to be asleep. The reason you feel more alert when you sleep for a longer period of time is because your body is able to get into a deeper sleep cycle. This is important because when you're in deep sleep, your body is able to repair itself. When you sleep for a shorter period of time, your body is only able to get into a light sleep cycle, which isn't as beneficial for repairing yourself. If you're someone who has trouble sleeping for longer periods of time, you may want to try waking up during the night and then going back to bed. This can help you get into a deeper sleep cycle. The caveat is that this is only beneficial for people who have trouble sleeping for longer periods of time. If you're someone who is able to sleep for longer periods of time without issue, then this isn't going to help you."
Why do pandas behave so seemingly different from other bears?," Pandas are actually bears, but they are a specialized subspecies of the brown bear.   are also known as giant pandas, but they are not actually giant.   are just very large and heavy. Pandas are also known as bamboo bears because they are specialized to eat bamboo, which is a type of grass.   are native to the mountain forests of China and are considered endangered. It's a little hard to say why pandas behave differently from other bears, but it's mostly because they evolved to live in a very specialized environment. The bamboo forests of China are very different from the forests of North America, where most other bears live. Pandas don't have to worry about hunting other animals or finding enough food to eat, so they don't need to be as strong or as aggressive.   also don't need to be very good climbers because the bamboo forests are so dense that they can't really climb.   also don't need to be very good swimmers because the bamboo forests are so close to the rivers that they can just wade across. Pandas are also very solitary, so they don't need to be very good at communicating with other bears.   don't even need to be very good at communicating with other pandas.  "

What is HDR on a camera?,"HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. It is a technology that allows a single picture to capture a wider range of light than a regular picture. This is done by taking multiple pictures with different exposures and then combining them into a single picture. This is useful for things like landscapes, where you may have bright sky and dark shadows, or scenes with bright light sources and dark shadows. HDR can also be used to create a more realistic picture, because it captures more detail than a regular picture."

Why do we feel warmer when moving our body?,"The body has a temperature regulation system that is designed to keep the core body temperature at a constant 37°C (98.6°F). The system is based on the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus. When the body temperature rises or falls, the thermoregulatory center sends a signal to the sweat glands, which release sweat to cool or warm the body. When we move, the muscles generate heat. The blood flow to the muscles is increased, and the blood flowing to the muscles is heated. The blood flow to the skin is decreased, so the skin cools down. This is why we feel cooler when we are not moving."

How does induced hypothermia extend the window of treatment for stroke and cardiac arrest?,"]( URL_0 ) The temperature at which the body is able to function best is called the ""normal body temperature"" or ""normal body temperature range"". In humans, the normal body temperature is between 97.7°F (36.5°C) and 99.5°F (37.5°C). If the body temperature drops below 95°F (35°C), it is considered hypothermia. If the body temperature drops below 90°F (32°C), it is considered frostbite. If the body temperature drops below 80°F (27°C), it is considered a medical emergency. In order to treat hypothermia, you need to get the body temperature back up to normal. The best way to do this is to warm up the body from the outside. This can be done with blankets, a heating pad, or a hot bath. If the person is unconscious, you should not use a hot bath because it could cause the person to swallow water. You should not use a heating pad on the person's head because it could cause the person's head to overheat. You should not use a hot shower because it could cause the person to overheat.   use a warm shower, but you should not use a hot shower.  "

What makes your stomach hurt when you are hungry and what causes your stomach to growl?," In the same way that your body needs a certain amount of energy to perform its functions, your stomach needs a certain amount of energy to digest your food. When your stomach is empty, it signals your brain that it needs to be fed, and when it is fed, it signals your brain that it is full. In the same way that you can feel your body needing more energy when you are hungry, you can feel your stomach needing more energy when you are hungry. You can feel your stomach needing more energy when you are hungry because your stomach is full of muscles that contract and relax as it digests your food. When your stomach is empty, these muscles contract more often than they relax, which causes your stomach to hurt. When your stomach is full, these muscles relax more often than they contract, which causes your stomach to feel better. The growling noise that you hear when your stomach is hungry is caused by the muscles in your stomach contracting. The muscles in your stomach are very sensitive, and when they contract, they make a noise that you can hear. Your stomach is also very sensitive to the smell of food, so when you are hungry, it can smell the food that you are eating, and this can cause it to growl."
How come one of the most common typing errors is to type a word twice in a row without noticing?," Lots of people here are saying that it’s because of the brain’s tendency to see what we expect to see, but I think it’s more than that. There are many other reasons why we type twice the same word. For example, if you are writing a story, you might be thinking about the next sentence and type the same word twice. Or you might be trying to write a phrase and type it twice by accident. I think it’s also possible to type twice the same word because you are thinking about the word’s meaning rather than the word itself. For example, if you are trying to say “I want to go to the store” and you’re thinking about the word “store” instead of “store” itself, you might accidentally type “store” twice. I’ve also noticed that sometimes I type the same word twice because I’m thinking about a word that is similar to the one I’m typing. For example, if I’m typing “fruit” and I’m thinking about “fruit” and “fruit juice”, I might accidentally type “fruit” twice. This is the same reason why you might accidentally type a word like “it’s” instead of “its”. When you’re typing, you might be thinking about the word you’re typing, or you might be thinking about something else that you’re trying to say.  "
Does Chinese Herbal Medicine work?,"...
I'm not a doctor, but I'll do my best to explain. Chinese herbal medicine is a complex system that uses hundreds of plants to treat a wide range of ailments. There is no one single plant that is used to treat every ailment, but instead a combination of plants are used to create a balanced remedy. This is very different to Western medicine which uses a single drug to treat a single condition. The plants used in Chinese herbal medicine have been used for centuries to treat a wide range of illnesses, including skin conditions. The plants are often mixed together to create a balanced remedy that is tailored to the specific illness being treated. Some of the plants used in Chinese herbal medicine have been shown to be effective in treating certain conditions, but there is still a lot of research that needs to be done to determine the effectiveness of the remedies. The plants used in Chinese herbal medicine are not just used to treat illnesses, but also to maintain health. For example, ginseng is used to improve energy and vitality, while astragalus is used to boost the immune system. Chinese herbal medicine is not just used in China, but also in many other countries around the world. In fact, many countries have their own unique herbal medicine systems, such as Ayurvedic medicine in India and Unani medicine in the Middle East.  "
Gas price increase in Mexico and PEMEX energy reform,"Gasoline prices in Mexico have been increasing since the beginning of the year. In fact, Mexico is the only country in the world where gasoline prices have been increasing since the beginning of 2019. Gasoline prices have been going up since the beginning of the year, with prices reaching their highest levels in 2019. This is the case because Mexico is a major oil exporter, and the country’s oil production is decreasing, while demand is increasing. In fact, Mexico’s oil production has been decreasing since 2015, while demand has been increasing since 2017. In fact, demand has been increasing faster than supply, and this is why prices have been going up. This is not the only reason why prices are going up, though. Mexico has been experiencing a drought, which has reduced the amount of water that is available for hydroelectric power generation. This has caused the price of electricity to increase, which in turn has caused the price of gasoline to increase. Mexico is also experiencing a shortage of gasoline, which is being caused by a combination of factors, including the drought and the fact that gasoline refineries are not operating at full capacity.

Why does coloring one spot on a piece of paper with many colors make it look black when black is the absence of color,"Because of the way light works. When you look at a piece of paper, you're seeing the light that's reflected off the paper. The paper reflects light of all colors, and the way it reflects that light is what you see. When you color a spot on the paper, you're changing the way the paper reflects light. You're adding more light to the paper, so that the light that's reflected off the paper is a combination of the light that was already there and the light you're adding. If you add enough light, the color of the spot will be brighter than the color of the rest of the paper. This is why you see black spots on the paper. Black is the absence of color. It's not the absence of light, though. Black is just the absence of light that's reflected off the paper. If you're adding enough light to make the spot brighter than the rest of the paper, you're adding so much light that the light that's reflected off the paper is brighter than the light that's reflected off the rest of the paper. This is why the spot looks black."

"If our brain can basically hold 'unlimited' memories, why do we forget our younger years? Is it gone forever? Can we bring it back?","It's not that our brain can hold unlimited memories, it's that the brain has a limit to how much information it can process at one time. The brain can process 7 chunks of information at a time, which is why we can only remember 7 items. You can train yourself to remember more by practicing remembering more, but you'll never be able to remember all the information that's ever been stored. As for why we forget our younger years, it's because our brain is constantly rewriting memories, and it's not always possible to remember every single thing. You can train yourself to remember more by practicing remembering more, but you'll never be able to remember everything. As for whether or not we can bring back memories, the answer is yes, but it's not always possible.

How do game developers make different levels of difficulty in their games?,"There are a few ways, but one of the most common is to use a system of 'progression' in the game. For example, you might have a 'normal' difficulty level, a 'hard' difficulty level, and a 'super hard' difficulty level.

"That sense you get when something feels ""off""","is called ""anomalous sensory perception."" This is the feeling that something is happening, even if you can't see it.Љ You're probably aware of this phenomenon if you've ever been in a situation where you know something is going to happen, but you can't explain why. For example, you might feel a chill in the air before it rains, or you might feel a strange sensation in your gut before a car accident. This sensation is caused by a part of the brain called the ""insula."" The insula is responsible for processing sensory information, such as pain, temperature, and touch. It also plays a role in emotion, empathy, and self-awareness. When something is ""off,"" it's probably because the insula is detecting some kind of abnormality in the environment. This could be a change in temperature, a shift in the air pressure, or a sudden change in the color of the light. There are a lot of different factors that could cause this feeling, including your own emotions, the emotions of other people around you, and even the emotions of the environment itself."
Why do kids feel safe sleeping when they have a teddy bear with them? Is there a scientific explanation?,"'The teddy bear effect' is a term used to describe the feeling of safety and comfort that some people feel when they have a stuffed animal with them. It's not a scientifically proven concept, but rather a psychological phenomenon. The term was coined by Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist who specializes in the study of emotion and empathy. In her book ""How Emotions are Made,"" she explains that the teddy bear effect is likely caused by the fact that we tend to anthropomorphize objects. In other words, we attribute human qualities to objects in order to make sense of them. So, the teddy bear is seen as a source of comfort because it's a stuffed animal that's been with us for a long time, and it's always there to comfort us. This is why people often feel more secure when they have a stuffed animal with them, even if it's not a teddy bear. It's not a scientifically proven concept, but it's a psychological phenomenon that's been observed in many people."

Why are professional video cameras so much larger than professional photography cameras?," & #x200B; 📷📹🎥 Why are professional video cameras so much larger than professional photography cameras? 🤔📷📹🎥 Professional video cameras are larger than professional photography cameras because they have larger sensors.

Can a magazine fed semi-auto not do the same job?,"The main reason is that bolt-action rifles are more accurate than magazine-fed rifles. This is because magazine-fed rifles have to feed the cartridges into the chamber, and this can cause the barrel to move slightly as the cartridge is being fed into the chamber. This movement can cause the bullet to hit off-center, which means that the bullet will not hit the target exactly where it was aimed. Bolt-action rifles, on the other hand, have a bolt that is operated by the user. This means that the bolt is not moving when the rifle is being fired, which means that the bullet will hit the target exactly where it was aimed. This is why bolt-action rifles are used by long-distance shooters. Another reason is that the bolt-action rifles are easier to use than magazine-fed rifles. Magazine-fed rifles require the user to remove the magazine and replace it with a new one. This can be difficult to do, especially if the rifle is being used in a hurry. Bolt-action rifles, on the other hand, do not require the user to remove the magazine. This means that the user can just pull the bolt back and forth, and the rifle will fire automatically. This is why bolt-action rifles are used by long-distance shooters."
"How does hand sanitizer work in making our hands feel clean when it seems that nothing ""washes away"" like it does with water?"," 🚨 Update: I'm not a scientist, just a curious person. I'll be sure to update my knowledge when I learn more. Thanks to all of you for the information! 💖 Hand sanitizer is basically just a very concentrated alcohol that kills bacteria and viruses. It works by drying out the bacteria and viruses, essentially killing them. So it doesn't wash them away. It kills them."
"How can someone eat a certain food, like shellfish, their whole life but suddenly develop a life threatening allergy to it?","It is possible to develop an allergy to something you have eaten for a long time, but it is rare. It is more common for people to develop allergies to new foods or foods that they have not eaten in a long time. There are several reasons why this can happen. One reason is that our immune system changes over time. Our immune system is responsible for protecting us from infections and diseases. When we eat food, our immune system looks for signs of infection or disease in the food. If it finds any, it will attack the food and destroy it. This is what is meant by ""allergies"". However, sometimes our immune system can get confused and start attacking the wrong things. This can happen when we eat a new food, or when we eat a food that we have not eaten in a long time. It can also happen when we are stressed or when we are sick. This is why people often develop allergies to foods when they are pregnant or when they are sick. Another reason why people can develop allergies to foods that they have eaten for a long time is because of genetics. If someone has a family history of allergies, then they are more likely to develop an allergy themselves.  "

why is celery frequently served with chicken wings?,"Celery is a common thing to eat with chicken wings because it is a crunchy, low-calorie food that helps to cut the richness of the wings. Chicken wings are often high in fat and calories, and celery helps to balance out the meal. The celery also helps to cleanse the palate between bites of the wings."
How can peristaltic movements transport liquids?,"Peristalsis is a wave-like muscle contraction that moves food through the digestive tract. The muscles of the digestive tract contract in a coordinated wave-like motion that moves the food down the digestive tract. The muscles are relaxed between contractions, which allows the food to move down the tract. This is how peristalsis works. The peristaltic movement is a coordinated wave of muscle contraction that moves food through the digestive system. The muscles of the digestive system are arranged in a spiral shape. When the muscles contract, they move the food down the spiral. The muscles are relaxed between contractions, which allows the food to move down the spiral. The peristaltic movement is controlled by the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is a nerve that runs from the brain to the abdomen. The vagus nerve sends signals to the muscles of the digestive system to contract. When the vagus nerve sends a signal, the muscles contract. When the muscles contract, they move the food down the spiral. The peristaltic movement is important for digestion. Food enters the mouth and is chewed. The food then enters the esophagus, where it is swallowed.  "
"How are surfers unharmed by ""wiping out""?","A lot of it is just momentum. Surfing is about being able to control your speed, and a lot of times when you wipe out, you are going so fast that you can't really control it. But a lot of the time you're also going so fast that you can't really get hurt. You're just going to bounce. The other part is that surfing is a very forgiving sport. If you fall off your board, it's not like you're going to get hit by a car or anything. If you do fall off, you'll probably just bounce back up. Surfing is also a very good sport for learning how to fall. You learn to fall and get back up again. You can't really do that in other sports."
Why human babies take so long to learn how to walk compared to other animal babies.,"In a baby, the spinal cord is not fully formed until the 24th week of gestation, and the brain does not reach its full size until the 30th week. This is why babies are born with a brain that is only 25% of its adult size. Babies need to develop a number of muscles in their legs to walk, including the muscles in the legs, hips, and lower back. The muscles in the legs are called the muscles of the lower limbs, and the muscles in the hips are called the muscles of the pelvis. The muscles in the lower back are called the muscles of the lumbar spine. Babies also need to develop the muscles in their arms, including the muscles of the upper limbs, the muscles of the shoulder, and the muscles of the arm. Babies also need to develop a number of muscles in their hands, including the muscles of the hand, the muscles of the wrist, and the muscles of the fingers. The muscles in the hand are called the muscles of the hand, and the muscles in the wrist are called the muscles of the wrist. The muscles in the fingers are called the muscles of the fingers. Babies need to develop these muscles in order to walk.  "
What's that low rumbling sound you hear when you block your ears?,"When you block your ears, sound waves are prevented from entering your ear canals, so the sound waves are reflected back into your head.

"When it is dark, why does it seem like things are easier to see in your peripheral vision versus looking at them straight on?"," URL_0 ) 👀👍 When the light is low, the pupil dilates, which makes the pupil larger. The pupil is the opening in the center of the iris. The iris is the colored part of the eye that controls how much light gets into the eye. When the pupil dilates, it lets more light into the eye, which allows the retina to see better in the dark. The retina is the layer of cells in the back of the eye that detect light. When the light is low, the retina has to work harder to detect light, which makes it easier to see in the dark. The retina is made up of many layers of cells. The cells in the back layer of the retina detect light. The cells in the middle layer of the retina detect movement. The cells in the front layer of the retina detect color. The cells in the back layer of the retina work harder when the light is low, which makes it easier to see in the dark."
How do huge animals like whales become washed ashore?," & #x200B; The short answer is that they are not washed ashore by waves, but rather by the tides. The long answer is that whales are not as big as you might think, and they are not as heavy as you might think either. The average adult male blue whale weighs about 150 tons, or 135,000 pounds. That's a lot of weight, but it's not that much weight. A blue whale is about 100 feet long, and it's about 25 feet around. That's about 2,500 square feet. So the weight of a blue whale is about 55 pounds per square foot. That's not that heavy. A blue whale is about 15% of the weight of a blue whale. So a blue whale that weighs 150 tons would have a volume of 250,000 cubic feet. That's a lot of space, but it's not as much space as you might think. And if you consider that whales are mostly water, that makes it even less. So if a blue whale were to get stranded on a beach, it would not be a big deal. It would just be a big whale.  "

What kind of damage can a separated ice shelf do?,"glaciers are formed when snow is compressed into ice over a long period of time. the weight of the ice causes it to flow down hill. a glacier can be thought of as a river of ice. as the ice flows, it carries rocks and sediment along with it. the ice is constantly moving down hill, so the rocks and sediment get ground down into smaller pieces. as the ice moves, it also flows over the land, picking up more rocks and sediment. this is how the glacier gets its characteristic blue color. the ice is made up of layers of ice and snow. when the ice melts, it leaves behind a layer of water. this is called a lake. the water can be very deep. if the water is deep enough, it can be very cold. it can be so cold that it freezes, and forms a layer of ice on top of the water. this is called an ice sheet. the ice sheet is very heavy. it can be thousands of feet thick. it can also be very large. it can cover an area of hundreds of square miles. the ice sheet can also be very heavy. it can be so heavy that it can crush the land underneath it.  ciers are often found in mountainous regions. the ice sheet can also be very slippery. it can be so slippery that it can slide off the land.

"Why is it that computers get slower as time goes on, even when you factory reset it?"," The short answer is that the software on the computer is constantly running and modifying the hardware. For example, the operating system is constantly running and modifying the hard drive, RAM, and other components. Over time, this can cause the hardware to wear out faster than it would if the computer wasn't running. The long answer is that it's not just the software that's running on the computer. The computer itself is constantly running. It's a lot of tiny little processes that are running in the background. For example, the hard drive is constantly spinning and reading and writing data. It's constantly making little clicks and whirs. The CPU is constantly running. It's constantly doing things like fetching instructions from memory, executing them, and storing the results. It's constantly moving data back and forth between the CPU and memory. All of these tiny little things add up and cause the computer to wear out faster than it would if it weren't running. Even though the computer is constantly running, the parts of the computer that are running are not always the same. The parts of the computer that are running are constantly changing. For example, the operating system is constantly running. It's constantly running in the background. It's constantly reading and writing data to the hard drive. It's constantly running the CPU. But the CPU itself is not always running. Sometimes the CPU is sitting there doing nothing.  "

Why does your mouth water like crazy when you're nauseous?,"It's an evolutionary response. The mouth watering is your body's way of getting more fluids into your system, which can help fight off an infection. It's like a survival instinct. When you get sick, your body tries to fight off the infection by increasing the amount of fluids in your body. This is a defense mechanism, to help prevent the infection from spreading."
If espresso is essentially concentrated coffee why is it less acidic?,"Because it's concentrated, there's less water to dilute the acidity. But also, the flavor compounds in espresso are different than the ones in brewed coffee. For example, brewed coffee has more of a roasted flavor, and more bitter flavors. Espresso has more of a fruity flavor and a slightly sweeter flavor. So it's not necessarily less acidic, but it's just not as bitter."
Why don't mitochondria reproduce until they exhaust their host cells to death?," & #x200B; Mitochondria are the power plants of our cells. They convert the food we eat into energy that our cells can use. But mitochondria are not like regular cells. They have their own DNA and their own set of genes. And they are very good at making energy. So good, in fact, that they can make more energy than our cells need. & #x200B; Our cells are like a small factory. They have a lot of different jobs, like making proteins and sending signals. And they need a lot of energy to do these things. But they don't need as much energy as they need to make the proteins and send the signals. So, the mitochondria are always making energy, even when the cells don't need it. & #x200B; This means that the mitochondria can get overworked. And when they get overworked, they can get sick.

Digitally signing message.,"A digital signature is a way to prove that a message is authentic. The idea is that if you know what the message is and you know the signature, you can prove that the message was not changed. A digital signature is a piece of data that is attached to a message and proves that the message came from the person who it says it came from. It is similar to a handwritten signature, but it is generated by a computer program rather than a person."
"Why do we get sick more often, when it's cold outside?","Because cold air is dry, and dry air is bad for your respiratory system. It's also why you get dry skin and dry eyes in cold weather.

What's the deal with Yellowstone?," Yellowstone National Park is a unique place, and its geological features are a big part of that. Yellowstone sits on top of a supervolcano that has erupted three times in the past 2.1 million years. The most recent eruption occurred 640,000 years ago. The volcano has a caldera, or large crater, that was formed when the volcano collapsed after the eruption. The caldera is about 30 miles wide and 45 miles long, and it’s 700 feet deep. Yellowstone is also home to more than 1,000 geysers and hot springs. The most famous geyser, Old Faithful, erupts about every 90 minutes. There are also many other geysers and hot springs, including Mammoth Hot Springs, which has been around for thousands of years. The hot springs and geysers are created by hot magma from the supervolcano. The magma is heated by the volcano, and it rises to the surface, creating the hot springs and geysers. The hot springs are also a great place to see a variety of wildlife, including elk, bison, and grizzly bears. Yellowstone is also a great place for camping and hiking."
What is the difference between luminescence and fluorescence?,"Luminescence is when a substance emits light without heat, while fluorescence is when a substance absorbs light and emits it as a different color. Fluorescence is the process of emitting light in response to absorbed light. Fluorescent lighting is a common example of this process. Luminescence is the process of emitting light without the absorption of light. This process is common in fireflies, glow sticks, and other similar items."
Why do some people struggle with weight loss/gain their whole lives while others are thin without effort?,"The body stops growing because of a hormone called somatostatin. It is produced in the pancreas and stops the release of hormones that stimulate growth. This hormone is produced throughout life, but the amount of it produced decreases after the age of 20."

Orgasms,"are the peak of pleasure, but they also serve a number of other functions. The most important of these is that they help to clear out bacteria and debris from the genital tract. This is especially important in women, as their reproductive system is so close to the anus. When a woman has an orgasm, it helps to push bacteria and debris out of the vagina, and into the rectum. From there, it can be expelled through the rectum, and out of the body. In men, the orgasm is less important for this purpose, as the reproductive system is further away from the anus. However, the orgasm still helps to clear out bacteria and debris from the prostate, which can help to prevent infections and other problems. It also helps to relax the muscles in the reproductive tract, which can help to improve sexual function, and prevent problems such as prostate cancer. Orgasms also help to increase blood flow to the genitals, which can help to improve sexual function, and prevent problems such as erectile dysfunction. In addition, orgasms help to release hormones such as oxytocin, which can help to improve mood, reduce stress, and promote feelings of relaxation.  "
Why are hackers focusing on the DNC rather than other organizations like the RNC?,"I think you're asking why the hackers are focusing on the DNC rather than other organizations like the RNC. The answer is probably that the DNC is the most prominent and influential political party in the US. As such, it is the most likely target for hackers looking to disrupt the political process or to discredit the party. The RNC is a little less prominent, but it is still a political party. Hackers may not be interested in it for the same reason. It is also possible that the RNC is less of a target than the DNC, but this is not something I can confirm. I can confirm that the RNC is not a target. It's not that the DNC is the most prominent political party in the US, it's the most prominent political party in the US for the Russians. The Russians are not trying to hack the RNC because they don't care about the RNC. They're trying to hack the DNC because they care about the DNC. The DNC is the most prominent political party in the US for the Russians, because the Russians are trying to influence the US political process.

how does texture affect the tastiness of food?,"I'm not an expert but I'm going to try my best. Texture is a very important aspect of food. It can affect how much you enjoy it, how much you want to eat, and how much you'll pay for it. Texture is a physical sensation that is often related to the mouthfeel of a food. It's how something feels in your mouth, such as crunchy, soft, crispy, chewy, or slimy. Texture is also related to the taste of a food. For example, a very crunchy texture can make a food taste more crunchy, a very soft texture can make a food taste more soft, and a very crispy texture can make a food taste more crispy. This is because the texture of a food can affect the way your mouth and tongue react to the flavors in the food. For example, if you have a very crunchy texture in your mouth, you'll feel like there's more texture to the food, which can make it taste more crunchy. If you have a very soft texture in your mouth, you'll feel like there's less texture to the food, which can make it taste more soft.  "
"What would happen to the Earth's climate, if all the ice melted?","You have a cold when you have a viral infection of the upper respiratory system. A cold is a viral infection of the nose, sinuses, and throat. If you have a cold, you will have some symptoms, but it will not be severe enough to require a hospital visit. A severe cold is when your symptoms are so bad that you are unable to care for yourself, and you need to be hospitalized. The symptoms of a severe cold are usually the same as a mild cold, but they are more severe. If you have a severe cold, you will need to be admitted to the hospital for treatment."
Is it possible to shrink forever?,"In theory, yes, it's possible. The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and if that continues, it's possible that the universe will eventually be so far apart that it will be impossible to communicate with each other. However, this is a very, very long time off. If the universe keeps expanding at its current rate, the furthest point from us would be about 28 billion light years away in 22 billion years. That's a very long time, but it's still a tiny fraction of the age of the universe. In fact, if the universe keeps expanding at its current rate, it will take the entire universe 100 billion years to reach the point where it will be impossible to communicate with each other. At that point, it will be too far away to see, even with the most powerful telescope."
per the post about diarrhea being the top killer during the civil war.. how can bad Diarrhea kill you?,"Diarrhea is the body's way of getting rid of bad bacteria and other waste. When you have diarrhea, you lose a lot of water and electrolytes. This can cause dehydration, which can be deadly. In addition, dehydration can cause other problems like low blood sugar. This can cause a person to faint and fall, which can lead to head injuries and other problems. If you have diarrhea, you need to drink lots of water and other fluids to stay hydrated. If you are dehydrated, you need to go to the emergency room right away."
how do the new robot prosthetic limbs work?,"> How do they work? I'm curious because I've seen a lot of videos of them doing things like running and jumping and stuff. They work by using a combination of sensors, motors and control systems. Sensors are used to detect the movement of the muscles in the stump. Motors are used to move the limb. The control systems are used to control the movement of the limb. The control systems are typically connected to a brain-computer interface that interprets the signals from the sensors and sends the signals to the motors. The brain-computer interface is connected to a prosthetic limb that is controlled by the motors. The prosthetic limb is designed to be controlled by the brain.

Why does cold water feel more hydrating than hot - or even room temperature water?,"This is a classic example of the [temperature-dependent sensory adaptation]( URL_0 ). Our body is adapted to a wide range of temperatures, but the cold and hot sensors in our skin are not equally sensitive. The cold sensor is much more sensitive to temperature than the hot sensor. So if the temperature of the water is cold enough, the cold sensor will be activated more strongly than the hot sensor, and we will feel the cold water as more refreshing than the hot water. This adaptation is not specific to water. The same adaptation happens with air. If you live in a hot climate, you will feel more refreshed by air that is slightly cooler than room temperature. If you live in a cold climate, you will feel more refreshed by air that is slightly warmer than room temperature."
How does a cancer cell come to be and how can it sometimes be too aggressive for treatment like chemo?,"ninjacat69
I am not a doctor, but I can give you some general information on the topic. Cancer cells are not a specific cell type, but rather a condition. In a healthy body, cells are constantly dividing to replace damaged or dying cells, and to grow new tissue. This is called cellular turnover. Cancer cells are cells that are able to divide in an uncontrolled manner. They are also able to grow and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer cells can be any cell type, and they are not necessarily more aggressive than other cells. The reason that cancer cells are often more aggressive than healthy cells is because they have a mutation that allows them to grow and divide faster than healthy cells.   spread to other parts of the body. Cancer cells are not necessarily more aggressive than healthy cells. They are just more aggressive than healthy cells. Cancer cells can be any cell type, and they are not necessarily more aggressive than healthy cells.

How does Impeachment actually work in the US?,"Impeachment is a constitutional process that allows Congress to remove a government official, including the President, from office. It is a two-step process. First, Congress must impeach the official. Second, the Senate must convict the official. Impeachment begins in the House of Representatives. The House has the power to impeach, and it does so by voting on a resolution that sets forth the charges against the official. The resolution must be approved by a simple majority vote. Once the resolution has been approved, the House sends it to the Senate for trial. The Senate has the power to try impeachments, and it does so by voting on the charges. The Senate must convict the official by a two-thirds vote. If the official is convicted, the official is removed from office. The Constitution sets out the process for impeachment, but it does not define what constitutes an impeachable offense. As a result, Congress has interpreted the Constitution to mean that the President and other government officials can be impeached for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" The Constitution also sets out the process for impeachment in Article II, Section 4.  "
Why do people still smell themselves even they knew is gonna smell terrible?,"It's called ""olfactory fixation"" and is a defense mechanism. Basically, when you smell something bad, you can't help but smell it again and again because your brain is trying to get the bad smell out of your nose. It's a way of trying to get rid of the bad smell by smelling it again and again. It's like a ""bad smell loop""."
"Why do cities and towns ""stagger"" stoplights so that no matter your timing you'll always be caught at a light?","Its not so much ""knowing"" as it is ""learning"".

What happens to muscle when you don't work out for a long period of six months or more?,"You lose muscle mass and strength. You also lose bone density. Your body will start to break down muscle tissue to use for energy, and you will lose your ability to perform physical tasks. You will also be at a higher risk for heart disease and other health problems. You can prevent or slow down this process by regularly exercising."
Why do people say things like 'Uh' and 'Um' while speaking?,"It's called filler words. They're words that you say when you're thinking about what to say next. They're usually a pause, like a ""uh"" or ""um"", but can be other words like ""you know"", ""like"", or ""so"". They're often used when you're talking to someone and you're not sure what to say next.  're trying to think about what you want to say next, and you say a word to fill the time until you can think of the next thing. They're also used to show that you're thinking about what you're saying. So if you say something like ""um, like, I don't know"", it means you're thinking about it and you're not sure what you want to say.  're trying to figure it out. It's not just you. I do it too, and I'm not even a native English speaker. I'm not sure why, but I think it's because we're trying to think of the next thing to say.  're trying to figure out what you want to say next.  're trying to decide what you want to say next.  "
CRISPR and how it'll 'change everything',"CRISPR is a gene editing tool that allows you to cut DNA at a specific location, remove a section of DNA, or add a new section of DNA to a gene. This is done using a small piece of RNA that acts as a guide to the location of the DNA. Once the DNA is cut, the cell's natural repair machinery can be used to repair the damage. This allows you to introduce changes to the DNA sequence. CRISPR can be used to cure diseases by editing out genes that are responsible for the disease. It can also be used to introduce genes that give resistance to diseases. CRISPR is also used to modify crops to make them more resistant to pests or diseases, or to improve their nutritional content. CRISPR can also be used to modify animals to make them more resistant to disease or to improve their ability to fight disease. The main advantage of CRISPR is that it is very precise and can be used to edit genes in a specific and targeted way. This is in contrast to older gene editing tools that could introduce random mutations to the DNA. CRISPR is also relatively easy to use and can be applied to many different types of cells. The main disadvantage of CRISPR is that it is still a relatively new technology and the long term effects of editing genes are not yet fully understood.  "

Why can't my front windshield have those defroster lines my rear window has that defrost the rear window really quickly?,"It is possible, it's called the [defrosting grid]( URL_0 ). It's a grid that is put on the windshield, and it's heated by the car's heating system. It's not very common, because the front windshield is much bigger than the rear one, and it's harder to make it look good. The rear windshield is also more important, because it's the part that you see first when you're driving, and it's the part that you see when you're stopped at a traffic light."
"Why do some animal groups, such as birds and mammals, care for their young, while others do not?","Birds and mammals are both warm-blooded, meaning they are able to regulate their body temperature. This means they can produce heat without relying on external sources of heat, such as the sun. This means they can do things like stay warm at night, or keep their young warm, even when it's cold outside. Other animals, such as reptiles and amphibians, are cold-blooded, meaning they can't produce their own heat. This means they have to rely on external sources of heat, such as the sun, to keep warm. This means they can't stay warm at night, or keep their young warm, without some external source of heat. Birds and mammals are also both social animals, meaning they live in groups and interact with each other. This means they have a strong instinct to protect their young, because they know that the young are vulnerable and need protection. Other animals, such as fish and insects, are solitary, meaning they live alone and don't interact with other animals. This means they don't have a strong instinct to protect their young, because they don't need to."
How does a mechanical keyboard improve typing speed?,", but I'll try to summarize it: the keys are designed to be pressed with a more defined ""click"" which makes it easier to tell when the key is fully pressed and not partially pressed. This allows the user to type faster because they don't need to try to figure out if the key is fully pressed or not. Also, some keyboards have a feature called ""actuation force"" which is the amount of force you need to apply to the key to make it press. This is usually measured in grams-force. A higher number means the key will be more difficult to press. This is useful for people who are used to typing with a lot of force and don't want to accidentally press the wrong key."

It's a rare and severe headache that can be a sign of a serious problem. It can be caused by a variety of things, including bleeding in the brain, a brain aneurysm, or a tumor. If you are experiencing this type of headache frequently, you should talk to a doctor. It's possible that you may have a serious underlying condition that needs to be treated."
Do people who sing off key hear themselves singing on key? Do they hear other off key singing as on key?,"You can hear yourself singing on key, but not necessarily in tune. There's a difference. For example, if you're singing a song and you're on pitch but you're not singing it in tune, you won't hear yourself as being off pitch. But if you're singing something that's in tune but you're not on pitch, you will hear yourself as being off pitch. I'm a singer and I'm going to give you the long answer. I'm not going to be able to speak for everyone, but I'll give you my own personal experience. I don't think I've ever heard myself singing off key. I've heard myself singing out of tune, but never off key. I don't think it's a thing. I think it's just a myth. I've heard people say that they hear themselves singing off key, but I don't think it's true. I've never heard anyone sing off key. I think it's just a thing that people say to make themselves feel better. When people sing off key, they hear themselves as on pitch. They don't hear themselves as off pitch. That's why they think they're singing off key. When you sing off key, you don't hear yourself as off key, you hear yourself as on pitch.  "
Why do females have higher voices than males?,"The reason is that the frequency of sound is directly related to the mass of the object emitting it. The mass of the vocal cords is much higher in females than in males, which means that the frequency of sound is higher in females than in males. In other words, the frequency of sound is directly related to the mass of the object emitting it. The frequency of sound is directly related to the mass of the object emitting it. The mass of the vocal cords is much higher in females than in males, which means that the frequency of sound is higher in females than in males."
How does our ear detect the sound vertical location ?,"The human ear is designed to detect sound waves that are coming from directly in front of it. This is why you can hear sounds from the front but not from behind you. It is because of the way the ear is shaped. The ear canal is a tube that is shaped to catch sound waves coming from the front. The sound waves enter the ear canal and hit the eardrum. The eardrum is a thin membrane that vibrates when it is hit by sound waves. The vibration of the eardrum causes the ear bones to vibrate. The ear bones are connected to the inner ear, which contains the cochlea. The cochlea is a spiral shaped chamber that contains tiny hairs that are connected to the inner ear. When the ear bones vibrate, the hairs in the cochlea vibrate as well. The vibration of the hairs in the cochlea causes electrical signals to be sent to the brain. The electrical signals are then interpreted by the brain as sound."
Have Any Technologies Peaked?,"The computer doesn't know how to play games, it's the hardware that makes it possible. It's the same reason why your car can drive you places, it's not because you have a special knowledge of cars, it's because the car is made in such a way that you can use it. It's the same with video games, they are made in such a way that you can play them, it's not because you have a special knowledge of video games. The computer is just a tool that makes it possible, and it's the same with all other tools.

"Why do certain chemical reactions take place almost instantly (ex. Li +H20), while others (ex. Fe+02) take place slowly and gradually?","Because they're different. The reaction between Li and H2O is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases energy. It's so exothermic that it's almost instantaneous. The reaction between Fe and O2 is an endothermic reaction, meaning it absorbs energy. It's so endothermic that it's very slow."
When a phone dies how does it still have enough power to tell me it is dead?,"There are several different power sources in a phone. The most common is the battery, but there are also capacitors, inductors, and some diodes. These are all used to store energy and power the phone. The capacitors are charged up from the battery and the inductors are charged from the battery. When the battery is dead, the capacitors and inductors will slowly lose their charge and the phone will eventually shut off. The diodes are used to prevent power from flowing in the wrong direction, and they don't lose charge. So when the battery is dead, the diodes will still be on. The phone can tell that it is dead by measuring the voltage across the capacitors and inductors. It can tell that the capacitors are discharging and the inductors are not charging. The diodes are still on, so it knows that the battery is dead."
What's the difference between having a heater on 72 degrees and having an air conditioner on 72 degrees?,"The difference is that a heater is trying to keep you warm, while an air conditioner is trying to keep you cool.

"How is it possible for a sail-powered boat to travel against--or, for that matter, faster than--the wind?","Sailboats use the wind to generate lift, which propels the boat forward. However, the wind isn't always blowing in the same direction. If it's blowing in one direction, then you can sail on that direction. If it's blowing in the other direction, then you have to sail on the side of the wind. This is called tacking. If you're tacking, you're sailing in a zigzag pattern. It's like sailing upwind, but instead of sailing into the wind, you're sailing at an angle to it. It takes a lot of skill and practice to sail a boat in this way. If you're sailing into the wind, then you're using the wind to propel the boat forward.   propel the boat forward, but you're also using the wind to turn the boat. If you're sailing against the wind, then you're using the wind to slow the boat down. You can also use the wind to turn the boat. This is called tacking. If you're sailing into the wind, then you're using the wind to propel the boat forward.  "
How do search engines know how long someone spends on your site?,"They don't. They don't care. If they did, they'd be tracking everything you do on the internet, and they'd be able to predict your next move.

"How come our body can absorb protein from food like cooked chicken, shouldn't they denature?","Proteins are made up of amino acids. They are essentially long chains of amino acids. Cooking a protein denatures the protein. This means that the amino acids are broken apart from each other. However, the body can still recognize the amino acids. The amino acids are then reassembled into the protein. So, it's not that the body can't absorb cooked chicken. It's that the body can't absorb cooked chicken because the protein is denatured. However, the body can absorb the amino acids that make up the protein."

Who were the first group of people to find Reddit, and how did they come across it?"," I am a 40 year old male who has been on Reddit for a couple years, and I am still amazed at the popularity of the site. It is amazing to think that a website with no ads and no paywall has been able to become so popular. There are so many people on Reddit that are so passionate about their interests, and I have made many new friends because of it. It is also amazing to see how many people have come to Reddit because of the subreddits. I have been on Reddit for a couple years, and I have never seen a subreddit that I am interested in.

"Why can cameras record 4K-25fps, FHD-50fps but not 4K-50fps or more?","The term ""frame rate"" is used to describe how often a camera captures a new frame of video. For example, a 24p camera captures 24 frames per second, and a 60p camera captures 60 frames per second. The number of frames per second is not the same as the number of pixels per second. The number of pixels per second is determined by the resolution of the camera and the aspect ratio of the footage. A 4K camera with a 16:9 aspect ratio captures 3840 x 2160 pixels in each frame. A 4K camera with a 21:9 aspect ratio captures 3840 x 1080 pixels in each frame. The more pixels per frame, the higher the resolution of the footage. The higher the resolution, the more detail can be captured. The number of frames per second determines how smoothly the footage is displayed. A 4K camera with a 24p resolution captures 3840 x 2160 pixels in each frame, and captures 24 frames per second.  "
Why Do We Get a Lump in Our Throats Before We Cry?,"It's the muscles in your throat tightening up to prevent you from choking on your own saliva while crying. It's also a way to help you keep your breathing in check while you're crying. It's not a lump, but rather the muscles in the throat contracting. When you cry, you swallow more, and this causes the muscles to contract to prevent the throat from closing up. It's a reflex that helps keep the airway open."
Why is taking an aspirin before the surgery harmful?," Pain management is a very important part of any surgery. You may have heard of an epidural, which is a local anesthetic that is injected into the spinal canal. It is very effective at numbing the area of the body that it is injected into, but it can also have serious side effects. The epidural is a general anesthetic, which means that it can cause you to become unconscious. This is why it is not used for minor surgeries. Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is commonly used to reduce the risk of blood clots. It is also used to reduce pain and inflammation. Aspirin works by blocking the production of a chemical called thromboxane, which causes blood vessels to constrict. By blocking the production of thromboxane, aspirin allows blood vessels to stay relaxed and open. This can reduce the amount of pain and inflammation that you experience after surgery. Aspirin also has a number of other effects on the body, including reducing the production of a chemical called prostaglandin. Prostaglandin is a chemical that causes blood vessels to constrict, which can reduce the amount of blood that reaches a certain area of the body.  "

I think a lot of people are happy that he's leaving because they think he's been a terrible president. I'm not sure I agree with that, but I think it's a fair viewpoint."
"why are good shows like firefly and futurama cancelled, while there are tons bad shows running on so many networks ?"," tl;dr: Because good shows are expensive, bad shows are cheap. Networks will always prioritize cheap over expensive, as it is the most profitable. In the 1990s, TV networks were in a state of chaos. The rise of cable had created new channels that could offer more programming than the traditional networks. This meant that the networks were competing for viewers, and they had to do whatever it took to attract viewers. This meant that the networks were willing to spend money on new shows. Firefly, for example, cost $1 million per episode to make, and it was cancelled after 11 episodes. It was expensive to make, and it didn't get enough viewers. Futurama was also cancelled after a few seasons, but it was cheaper to make. The show was animated, and it only cost $2 million per episode. The networks were willing to spend more money on shows that they thought would be successful. The networks were also willing to take risks. If a show failed, the networks would cancel it, but if it succeeded, it would bring in a lot of money. This meant that the networks were willing to take chances on new shows, and they were willing to spend money on them. In the 2000s, the networks started to change. They were no longer willing to spend money on new shows.  "

What causes the weird taste when you burn your tongue?,"& #x200B; Burning your tongue is caused by the nerves on your tongue being stimulated.   can happen from eating something that is very hot, or very spicy. It can also happen from eating something that is very cold, or very sour. The nerves on your tongue are connected to your brain, and when they are stimulated, it sends a signal to your brain that is interpreted as a taste. The taste of burning is actually not a taste at all, but rather the sensation of something being hot or spicy. When you eat something that is very hot, or very spicy, it can stimulate your tongue and make it feel like it is burning. It is actually not burning, but rather it is just sending a signal to your brain that is interpreted as a burning sensation.   is why some people will eat something hot or spicy and then say that it tastes like they are burning their tongue.

"Why do some shows have ""and ACTOR as CHARACTER"" in their opening sequence, while all other actors are named without character?","In the case of the shows you're talking about, the actors are not being named as their characters, they are being named as the actors who portray those characters. The opening credits are not the same as the closing credits. The opening credits are the ""thank yous"" and the closing credits are the ""thanks"". The opening credits are also where the legal information is, the name of the show, the network, the production company, etc. The actors who are not listed as ""and [actor name as character"" are usually the people who are not actually characters in the show. They are the writers, the directors, the producers, the production assistants, the make-up artists, the costume designers, the stunt coordinators, the choreographers, etc. They are the people who work behind the scenes to make the show happen."
"What are ""steel cut"" oats/oatmeal and what makes them (apparently) preferable?","Steel cut oats are oats that have been cut into little pieces by a blade, rather than being rolled into flakes. This makes them chewier and more textured, and they have a more nutty flavor. They are also more filling. Steel cut oats are more nutritious than rolled oats because they contain more fiber and more of the healthy fats that are found in whole grains. They also have a higher protein content than rolled oats, and they are less processed than rolled oats."
How do viruses and colds form and where do they come from?," Colds are viruses. There are many different viruses that can cause a cold. The most common one is the rhinovirus. It is also the hardest one to develop a vaccine for. The virus is spread by the droplets of fluid that are released when a person coughs or sneezes. The virus is then inhaled by another person, who may then become infected. The virus also can survive on surfaces for a while and can be spread that way. Viruses are not living organisms. They are pieces of DNA or RNA that are surrounded by a protein coat. They can only multiply inside a living cell. The cell is tricked into taking in the virus and allowing it to replicate inside. Once the virus has replicated, it can leave the cell and go on to infect other cells. The virus does not have the ability to reproduce on its own. It needs a host cell to do that. This is why the virus is not considered a living organism. Viruses can be spread by direct contact with an infected person, or through the air by a cough or sneeze. Once a virus is inside a cell, it can multiply quickly and cause the cell to produce more viruses. The cell is eventually destroyed by the virus. This can cause the infected person to experience symptoms such as fever, headache, or fatigue."

How come when you're about to fall asleep - all sounds around you amplify and seem very loud.,"This is called a ""sleep-related sound sensitivity"" and it is a phenomenon that occurs when you're about to fall asleep. This is a common phenomenon, but it is not well understood, and there is a lot of research being done to understand why it happens.   which is a complex process that involves the brain and the ear. It is believed that the brain is able to hear more sounds when you're about to fall asleep because the brain is able to focus on these sounds more. The brain is able to focus on these sounds more because the brain is able to tune out other sounds. This is a normal process, but it is believed that it happens more when you're about to fall asleep.

Why is a single 'Horsepower' equal to 550 foot-pounds per second (ft-lbs/sec)? How was this system created and measured?,"The concept of horsepower was invented by James Watt in the early 19th century. Watt was an English engineer who designed the first practical steam engine. At the time, steam engines were not very efficient. They produced a lot of heat, but not much power. Watt was trying to figure out how to make them more efficient. He realized that the steam engine was not the only thing that was producing heat. The engine itself was also producing heat. Watt figured out that if you took the amount of heat that the engine produced and divided it by the amount of power it produced, you could come up with a measure of how much power the engine produced. He called this measure horsepower. To measure the power of the steam engine, Watt used a machine called a dynamometer. A dynamometer is a machine that measures the force of a machine. In this case, Watt used a dynamometer to measure the force that the steam engine produced. He measured the force by pulling a weight up a hill using a rope. The weight was attached to the end of a long rope. The rope was wrapped around a pulley at the top of the hill. Watt pulled the rope, which pulled the weight up the hill. He then measured the distance that the weight had traveled. He did this by measuring the length of the rope.  "
"When feeling anxious/having an anxiety attack, why does it feel like it's so difficult to get enough oxygen?","Oxygen is important to your brain. It's important for you to be able to think. When you're anxious, your brain is working harder than it usually does. It's like you're running a marathon, but you're also working in a hot kitchen. You need oxygen to keep your brain working. When you're anxious, your brain is working harder than usual, and your body is trying to keep up. But your body can only give you so much oxygen. So, when you're anxious, your body is trying to give you as much oxygen as possible. It's like your body is holding your breath, and your brain is working as hard as it can. When you're anxious, you can feel like you're not getting enough oxygen. That's why it feels so hard to breathe when you're anxious."
"The ""Old Math"" in Tom Lehrer's New Math","song refers to the traditional way of teaching math, which emphasized memorization, repetition, and drill.Љ The ""New Math"" refers to a more modern approach to teaching math, which emphasized critical thinking, problem solving, and individualized instruction. The song is a satire of the new math movement, and the lyrics poke fun at the perceived shortcomings of the new math. The song was written in 1965, and it was popularized by Tom Lehrer's performances of the song on television. The lyrics of the song are as follows: New Math, new math, it's all so neat, / With x's and y's, we're in a treat. / The old math was all about addition, / Now we're adding up to subtraction.  s, we're in a treat. / The old math was all about addition, / Now we're adding up to subtraction.  s, we're in a treat. / The old math was all about addition, / Now we're adding up to subtraction.

"How do companies like Netflix and HBO know it's worth producing their own shows when they have no way to gauge how much money they earn as a result of each show? If Game of Thrones costs $x, how does HBO know they would lose more than that in subscriber revenue if they cancelled it?","They don't. They have no way to know. They are just trying to make the best guess possible based on what they know. The only way to know for sure is to try it and see. That's what Netflix is doing with Stranger Things. They have no idea if it's going to be popular, but they're willing to take the risk. And if it does well, they'll make more of them. And if it doesn't, they'll cancel it. That's how Netflix makes its money. They are a streaming service. They don't make money from TV shows. They make money from people paying to watch their TV shows. They don't need to know how much money they'll make from each show, because they can just make more shows.

How do scientists determine what strain of influenza the flu shot will be made for each year?,The strains of influenza that are most likely to be spread from person to person are determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC. The WHO identifies three strains that are most likely to be spread and cause the most illness. The CDC then makes a vaccine that protects against those three strains. The vaccine is made using a virus that is very similar to the virus that causes the flu. The virus is then weakened so it can't make you sick. The vaccine is then given to people so their bodies can make antibodies against the flu virus. These antibodies are what protect your body from getting the flu. The vaccine is also given to people who are at risk of getting very sick from the flu.

What are the rules of cricket -- or at least enough of the rules that I would know what the heck I'm watching?," Cricinfo has a great article on this, but I'll try to give you a brief summary. The game is played on a rectangular field with a flat, grassy surface. The field has two sets of stumps, one set in the center and one set at each end. The stumps are about 5 feet tall, and are placed about 22 yards apart. The stumps are held in place by three vertical ropes that are about 10 feet tall. At each end of the field is a set of three stumps, and a bail is placed on top of each stump. The bail is a small, flat piece of wood that is about 1 inch square. The batsman must hit the ball with his bat so that it hits the stumps or the bail. If the ball hits the stumps or the bail, the batsman is out. If the ball hits the ground, it is considered a dead ball, and the batsman continues to bat. If the ball hits the wicket, the batsman is out. The wicket consists of two vertical stumps and two horizontal ropes. The batsman must not hit the ball in such a way that the ball hits the stumps or the bail. If the ball hits the stumps or the bail, the batsman is out.  "
Why does intense hunger sometimes cause nausea? That seems like the opposite of what should happen.,"The brain and the gut are connected. The brain is responsible for regulating your appetite and the gut is responsible for digesting your food. When you are hungry, your brain tells your gut to digest food. When you are full, your brain tells your gut to stop digesting food. When you are nauseous, your brain tells your gut to stop digesting food and your gut tells your brain to stop you from eating. It is a feedback loop. When your gut is in the process of digesting food, it releases hormones that tell your brain that you are full. When you are nauseous, your brain tells your gut to stop digesting food. Your gut then tells your brain that you are full and your brain tells your gut to stop you from eating."

how does my phone calculate how many flights of stairs went up?,"I'm a physicist. I work in a field called Biomechanics. It's the study of how the body moves. I can't speak to your specific phone, but in general, it's a combination of a couple of things. First, it's using some kind of accelerometer, which is a device that measures the acceleration of the phone. This is probably done using a piezoelectric element, which is a material that generates an electric charge when it is bent. The phone is probably using a gyroscope to measure the orientation of the phone, and a compass to measure the direction the phone is moving. Then, it's using some kind of algorithm to convert the data into an estimate of the number of flights of stairs. I'm not sure how it does that, but it's probably using some kind of equation that takes into account the amount of energy it takes to climb a flight of stairs, and the amount of energy the phone is generating."
"What neurologically is happening when a song ""gets old"" from hearing it too often?"," The more you listen to a song, the more you start to internalize the song. The internalization of a song is the process of the song becoming a part of your brain. When a song is first introduced, the brain processes the song as a whole. But as the brain processes the song more and more, the brain starts to break the song down into smaller parts. This is why when you hear a song, you can pick out different parts of the song and sing along with them. The brain has created a map of the song, and has stored the map in the brain. When you hear the song again, the brain can recall the map and recreate the song. This is what makes a song ""familiar"" and why it sounds so good when you hear it again. But when you hear a song too much, your brain starts to get bored of the song. The brain has heard the song so many times, it knows the song so well, that the brain doesn't need to work to hear the song anymore. The brain just plays the song without even thinking about it. The brain has learned the song so well that it doesn't need to think about it anymore. This is why when you hear a song too much, you don't like it anymore. You are not thinking about the song, you are just hearing the song. You are not listening to the song, you are just hearing the song.  "

How do snowflakes get their unique shape?,"Snowflakes are formed when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses onto tiny particles of dust or pollen, forming tiny ice crystals. As more and more water molecules stick to the crystal, it grows in size, and the temperature and humidity of the air can affect the shape of the crystal. Snowflakes are unique because the conditions in the atmosphere are so vastly different that each snowflake is a one-of-a-kind creation."
; how does a computer game mimic the laws of physics.,"The physics engines are algorithms that simulate the behavior of objects based on their properties, such as mass, friction, gravity, etc. These algorithms are based on Newton's laws of motion and other equations of motion. For example, if you have a ball on the ground, you can use the equations of motion to calculate how fast the ball will roll, how much force it will exert on the ground, and how much it will bounce. If you have a character in a game, you can use the equations of motion to calculate how fast the character will move, how much force it will exert on the ground, and how much it will bounce. The physics engine will also use the game's camera to calculate the character's position and orientation in space. The physics engine will also use the game's physics settings to determine how much force the character will exert on the ground, and how much the ground will exert on the character. The physics engine will also use the game's collision detection to determine when the character collides with the ground or other objects. If the character collides with the ground, the physics engine will calculate how much force the ground will exert on the character. If the character collides with another object, the physics engine will calculate how much force the other object will exert on the character.  "
Why do we have inflation? Is it necessary?,"Inflation is caused by the economy growing faster than the money supply. When the economy grows faster than the money supply, people can earn more money, but the money supply stays the same, so the money supply becomes worth less. This means that people can buy more things for their money. If the economy grows faster than the money supply, then the money supply becomes worth less, and people can buy less things for their money. This is called deflation. Inflation is necessary because it makes it easier to pay back loans. When you borrow money, you have to pay back the money you borrowed, plus the interest on that money. If the money supply doesn't grow, then you have to pay back more money than you borrowed, because the money supply has become worth less. This is called debt deflation. If you can pay back your loans in a currency that is worth less than it was when you borrowed the money, then you have to pay back more money than you borrowed. This is called debt deflation. This is a problem because it makes it harder for people to pay back their loans. If the money supply doesn't grow, then people have to pay back more money than they borrowed, which makes it harder for people to pay back their loans.  "
How does charcoal mellow whiskey?,"It's actually activated carbon. It's a carbonaceous material that has been heated to high temperatures (400-600°C) in the absence of air. This process converts the organic material into a porous, highly absorbent material. The carbon is highly porous and the high surface area allows it to adsorb compounds from the whiskey, such as volatile flavor compounds, that are responsible for the astringent and bitter notes. This is why it is used in water filtration. It removes impurities from the water by adsorbing them."

Please explain rutherford scattering to me!,"I am a chemistry student and I have to do a lab report on this topic and I want to understand it fully. PLEASE HELP! 😩 I don’t know how to explain it in a way that you will understand, but I’ll give it a shot. Rutherford scattering is a process in which a beam of alpha particles is directed at a thin foil. Alpha particles are just the alpha part of a nucleus, and they are a lot heavier than electrons. They are very similar to alpha particles that are emitted from the nucleus of an atom, but they are emitted from a different source.   particle hits a nucleus, it is absorbed and a nucleus is formed.   particle hits a nucleus, it is absorbed and a nucleus is formed.   particle hits a nucleus, it is absorbed and a nucleus is formed.   particle hits a nucleus, it is absorbed and a nucleus is formed.   particle hits a nucleus, it is absorbed and a nucleus is formed.   particle hits a nucleus, it is absorbed and a nucleus is formed.   particle hits a nucleus, it is absorbed and a nucleus is formed.   particle hits a nucleus, it is absorbed and a nucleus is formed.

How street-level drugs are becoming increasingly more sophisticated. Are there real-life Walter Whites?,"I'm not an expert on the subject, but I've heard that the problem with drugs is not so much the drugs themselves, but the people that produce them. The people that produce drugs are often criminals, and they're going to be very aggressive in their marketing of the product. They're going to want to make sure that their product is as good as possible, so they'll be willing to do things like cut it with other drugs that don't have any negative effects on the user, or they'll be willing to put things in it that will make the user feel good. They're going to do this to make sure that the people that buy their product will keep buying it, and that they'll tell their friends about it. The problem with this is that the people that produce these drugs are not going to be very careful about what they're putting into the drug. They're going to be very concerned with making sure that their product is as good as possible, but they're not going to be very concerned with making sure that it's safe. They're going to be very concerned with making sure that their product is good, and they're going to be very willing to put things in it that are going to make people feel good, but they're not going to be very concerned with making sure that it's safe.

"How did Facebook know I might be friends with a person in another city, when I've given them almost no information?","It's actually pretty easy to do. Facebook is able to determine that you might be friends with someone in another city because they know that you're friends with someone in the same city. They also know that you're friends with someone in a different city, so they can use that information to determine that you might be friends with someone in a city that's in between the two cities. They also know what your interests are, so they can use that information to determine what you might be friends with. Facebook can also use information that you've shared with your friends to determine what you might be friends with. They know what you like, what you don't like, what you're interested in, what you're not interested in, what you're friends with, and what you're not friends with. They also know what you're looking for. They know what you're interested in, what you're looking for, and what you're not looking for. They also know what you're friends with. They know what you're friends with, what you're not friends with, and what you're looking for. They know what you're looking for, and what you're not looking for.  "
What would it be like swimming in zero gravity?,"It would be like floating in water. You could not swim, but you would just float. The problem is that you would not be able to get any traction, so you would not be able to turn or stop. You could not dive either, since you would not be able to get any speed up. You would just float. It would be like being in a zero gravity pool. You could not dive or swim, but you could float in any direction and at any speed you wanted."
"If you want to wear two pairs of socks in cold weather, and one pair is thicker and more insulated than the other, which should you put on first to keep your feet the warmest?","If you want to be warmest, you should put the thicker pair of socks on first. The reason is that the thicker socks will insulate your feet better, so they will keep your feet warmer longer. You should put the thinner socks on second so that they don't get wet from your feet sweating, and so that they don't get soiled from the dirt on your feet."

Why is it that certain smells may smell good to me but to others it may smell awful?," Scent is a very subjective experience. What smells good to one person may smell bad to another. The brain is responsible for interpreting the scent of a substance and it can be influenced by a person’s upbringing, environment, and emotions. Different people have different olfactory receptors, which are the cells in the nose that detect smells. These receptors are genetically determined, so people have different receptors. The same smell can trigger different receptors in different people, which is why it can smell differently to them.   in the oven to toast, you might get a nice, warm, slightly crispy smell. If you were to take the same bread and put it in the freezer, you might get a cold, slightly stale smell. The bread itself didn’t change, but the temperature of the bread changed, which triggered different olfactory receptors in different people. In addition to temperature, the smell of a substance can be influenced by other factors such as the presence of other substances, the amount of air in the environment, and the person’s emotional state. The presence of other substances can change the way the brain interprets the smell of a substance.  "
"How come we can smell over people's houses and jackets and things, but we can never smell our own houses?","It's a combination of the way our senses work and the way our brains process that information. Your brain is very good at filtering out the smells of your own house, because it's a familiar smell that doesn't mean anything to you. When you walk into your own house, you're not thinking, ""Oh, I smell something strange. What is it?"" You're thinking, ""I'm home."" You're thinking, ""I'm safe."" You're thinking, ""I'm happy."" You're thinking, ""I'm hungry."" You're thinking, ""I need to go to bed."" All of those thoughts are going through your mind, and your brain is filtering out the smell of your own house because it's a familiar smell. It's like the way you can hear your own voice on a recording. You can hear your own voice, but you don't really hear it. It's just something that's there. Your brain is doing the same thing with the smell of your own house. It's just something that's there, and it doesn't mean anything to you.  "
How are the new Intel processors better than older ones even if they're running at the same speed and have the same number of cores?,"Because they are not running at the same speed. Intel has a new technology called ""Skylake"" which allows for faster and more efficient CPUs. This is why Intel is claiming that the new CPUs are faster. They are not. They are just running faster than the older CPUs. The CPUs are still running at the same speed."
"Dreams. Why sometimes the dream is so vivid that we get that ""Damn it was just a dream"" feeling?","Dreams are your brain processing all the information it's received in the day. You don't remember all the information you receive, but the brain processes it all the same. It's like a computer running a program, but the program is a little different every day. The brain has a lot of different programs, and they're all running at the same time. Some programs are old and some are new, and some are important and some are not. When you wake up, you're running a new program, which is why your dreams are often different from night to night. Some people have dreams that are the same every night, and some people have dreams that are different every night. It's not clear why some people have dreams that are different every night, but it's probably because the brain is processing different information each night."

why did humans start cooking food?,"We didn't always cook. We didn't even always hunt. For the first 2.5 million years of our existence we were just scavengers. We didn't even have teeth. We didn't need teeth.   just eating what we could find, whatever was already dead and rotting. We didn't need to kill animals, we just needed to eat. But then we started killing animals and eating them. This was a big change. It was a big change for several reasons. First, it was better for our health.   getting more nutrients from our food.   getting more protein.   getting more fat.   getting more energy.   getting more of everything. Second, it was better for our social structure. When we started eating meat we started to form groups. We started to cooperate. We started to work together. We started to share. We started to work towards a common goal. Third, it was better for our economy.   able to take better care of ourselves.   able to feed ourselves better.   able to take care of our children better.   able to build better homes.   able to build better tools.   able to build better weapons.   able to build better everything.

Why can we recognize so many celebrities and fictional characters if the human mind is only supposed to be able to know about 200-250 people?,"Because we don't actually know 200-250 people. The number is just an estimate based on a study that was done in the 60s, and the estimate is based on the number of people we know by name. However, it's not a hard limit. There are plenty of people who can remember the names of hundreds of people."
Why do lenders prefer people with high credit scores? Won't they make less money?," Lenders don't make money from you, they make money from the interest they charge you. The higher your credit score, the more likely you are to pay back the loan on time, so the more likely they are to make money. If you're going to pay back a loan on time, you're also more likely to be a good borrower in the future, so lenders want to make sure they're giving loans to people who will pay them back. The interest rate is a trade-off. The lender charges you more money for the loan to make up for the risk of you defaulting. If you have a high credit score, you're less likely to default. The lender will charge you less interest. This is why people with high credit scores are more likely to be approved for loans, and why lenders prefer them."
How does a surface-to-air missile (SAM) distinguish hostile aircrafts from friendly aircrafts?,It's not that simple. SAMs are not just going to shoot at everything they see. They're going to shoot at things that are moving and are a threat. They use radar to detect aircrafts and they have to be able to distinguish between hostile and friendly aircrafts. The radar systems use a lot of different ways to detect aircrafts and can be very sophisticated. The system will be able to tell the difference between a friendly aircraft and a hostile aircraft based on the way it's moving and how it's shaped. This is how the system is able to tell the difference between a friendly aircraft and a hostile aircraft.
"When freezing stuff like vegetables or a chicken with liquid nitrogen, why does it shatter/break like glass?","It's not shattering like glass, it's breaking like glass because of the extreme cold. At that temperature, the molecules are moving very slowly, and the bonds between them are very weak. When you hit the object, the molecules are jostled and bumped, and they break apart. It's like hitting a very cold glass with a hammer. You'd expect it to break, right?"

"Why is it when we are younger we like sweeter food and can eat large quantities of them. But as adults we tend to like more fuller and bitter flavors, and sweeter foods can sometimes be ""too rich""?","Its because your taste buds change. As you get older, the taste buds change. When you were young, the taste buds were more sensitive to sweetness. As you get older, your taste buds change and you prefer more bitter foods. Also, as you get older, you may find that you have a less sensitive sense of smell. This can also contribute to the change in taste."
What happens when our lips are chapped?,"Lips are lined with mucous membranes, which are the protective lining of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital systems. They are made up of epithelial cells and mucin, a thick, sticky substance that helps to keep the cells moist and lubricated. The mucin is produced by the epithelial cells and secreted into the extracellular space. Mucin is a very large molecule, so it has to be folded into a specific shape to fit into the mucous membrane. When the mucin is folded into its proper shape, it creates a protective barrier that keeps the cells moist. When the cells get dry, the mucin becomes sticky and stretches out, allowing water to enter the cells and keep them moist."
Why do we find it hard to breathe when facing towards a strong wind?,"The wind pushes on you, and the harder it pushes, the more it pushes on you, the more you push back, and the harder it pushes. The wind is pushing on you, and you're pushing back, and that makes it harder to breathe."

"How do we know than an earthquake is ""long over due""","and not just a random earthquake?
1.   of the movement of the tectonic plates. The Earth is broken into a few large plates, and these plates are always moving. If you look at the map of the Pacific Northwest, you'll see that the Juan de Fuca plate is moving towards the northwest, and the North American plate is moving towards the southwest. This movement is what causes earthquakes. 2. We have seismometers. These are instruments that measure the movement of the Earth. They can measure the movement of the Earth on a very small scale, and they can detect the movement of the Earth over a very long time. 3.   of the history of earthquakes in a given area. We know how often earthquakes occur in the Pacific Northwest, and we know how often they occur in California. 4.   of the size of earthquakes in a given area.

Why is it harder to keep your balance you close our eyes?," The balance system in our body is called the vestibular system. It consists of three semicircular canals and otolith organs. The otolith organs are filled with calcium carbonate crystals that move in response to head movements. The crystals are attached to hair cells which send signals to the brain. The vestibular system is responsible for maintaining posture and balance. When you close your eyes, the visual system which is responsible for guiding your balance system is not functioning. The vestibular system is not able to rely on visual cues to maintain balance and it is harder to keep your balance. This is why you tend to lose your balance when you close your eyes."
Why is punching through a wall or smashing a glass object so much more satisfying than squeezing something like a stress ball when you're angry?,"I think it's because of the release of tension. When you're angry, you have a lot of tension in your body, and when you punch something, you release that tension. The tension doesn't just go away, it gets released in a more violent way. When you squeeze a stress ball, you're just releasing some of the tension in your body, but it doesn't go away, it just gets redistributed to the ball."

"If I lose 10 lbs, how does it leave my body?","Your body is made up of water, fat, and muscle. The fat is made up of molecules called triglycerides. Your body has a system called the lymphatic system that helps to remove excess fluids, waste, and other unwanted substances from your body. When you lose weight, your body will break down the fat molecules into smaller molecules called fatty acids. The fatty acids are then absorbed by the lymphatic system and taken to the liver.  ids into glucose, which is then used by your body as energy. The lymphatic system is like a network of vessels that carry fluid and waste throughout your body. The lymphatic system is made up of two main vessels: the superficial lymphatic vessels and the deep lymphatic vessels. The superficial vessels are located just beneath the skin and are connected to lymph nodes. The deep vessels are located in your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The lymphatic vessels are connected to the blood vessels. When you lose weight, your body will break down the fat molecules into smaller molecules called fatty acids. The fatty acids are then absorbed by the lymphatic system and taken to the liver.  "
Its January in Pennsylvania. Why are there birds chirping? Didn't they all fly south?,"I know that I'm not the only one who's confused. I'm not an expert, but I do know that some birds are year-round residents in PA, and some others are migratory and will come back in the spring. So, it's possible that some birds are still around. I'm not sure if this is the case, but I've seen a lot of birds in PA during the winter, and they are not all the same birds. I'm sure that some of them are migratory, but some of them are year-round residents. I've seen cardinals, blue jays, robins, and crows in PA during the winter, and I'm sure that there are a lot of other species that I'm not even aware of. It's possible that some of these birds are staying around because there's plenty of food available, or because they are not migrating. I'm not sure, but I think that some birds don't migrate at all. I'm sure that there are a lot of other factors that could be at play, but I think that there's a lot of variability in the behavior of birds, and there's no one answer."

Why do Americans not have a problem with moving football teams 100's of miles?,"Because Americans are not as attached to sports teams as Europeans are.

"Why do men only go bald on their heads and nowhere else? Their beards, for example.","Balding is a result of a lack of testosterone. Testosterone stimulates the hair follicles to grow. If you have a low testosterone level, your hair will start to thin and eventually fall out. Beards are a different story. Beards are a combination of hairs that grow on the chin, mustache, and cheeks. Beards are a different type of hair than the hair on your head. Beards are called vellus hairs. Vellus hairs are a type of hair that grows in the axillae (underarm), the pubic area, and the face. Vellus hairs are much thinner than the hairs on your head. They are also much softer. Vellus hairs are not stimulated by testosterone. They are stimulated by a hormone called androgen."
Why does it seem like people are predisposed to avoid prolonged interaction with people who have depression?, & #x200B; I think it's because we are wired to avoid things that are painful or dangerous.

"Why there is no remote finder button on TV, to track lost remote?","It's not really a matter of ""cost"". It's a matter of ""functionality"". TVs are designed to receive a signal from a remote control, and not to transmit a signal to a remote control. It would be a lot more expensive to make a TV that could do that. And it would be a lot less useful to most people. People who lose their remotes can just use a different one, or buy a replacement. TVs are not something you can easily replace. TVs are also designed to be used in a fixed location, so there's no need to track them. If you want to track a TV, you'd need to add a tracking device, which would add to the cost. And it would also add to the complexity of the TV. It's not something that would be easy to do, and it would probably be more expensive than it's worth."

"how passwords work? what happens in the backend when you type password in gmail,facebook etc?what about phone passwords?"," Dont know much about it. I've heard about the ""hash"" thingy, but I don't know how it works. I'm no expert. But I'll try my best to explain what I know. When you sign up to an account, it asks you to create a password. That password is then stored in a database. This is the most secure part of the process. The password is stored in an encrypted form. This means that only the user knows what the password is. The password is not stored in plain text. The password is encrypted using a mathematical formula. This formula is known only to the user and the service provider. The password is then stored in the database, along with a unique identifier. This identifier is what the service provider uses to verify the password. When the user logs in, the service provider compares the password entered by the user with the password stored in the database. If the passwords match, then the user is allowed to log in. If they don't, then the user is not allowed to log in. This is the most secure part of the process. The password is stored in an encrypted form, so only the user knows what the password is. The password is stored in the database, along with a unique identifier. This identifier is what the service provider uses to verify the password.

What are the reasons people say communism/socialism does not work with larger populations?," Sounds like you are asking about the ""Communist Manifesto"". The Communist Manifesto is a political pamphlet written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848. The main points of the pamphlet are: 1. The history of the rise of the bourgeoisie and the fall of the proletariat. 2. The economic and political struggle between the two classes. 3. The ultimate victory of the proletariat and the establishment of a communist society. The pamphlet argues that the proletariat is the only class that can successfully overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a communist society. The pamphlet also argues that the proletariat is the only class that can successfully establish a communist society because the proletariat is the only class that is not motivated by self-interest. The bourgeoisie is motivated by self-interest and therefore cannot establish a communist society. The Communist Manifesto also argues that the bourgeoisie is motivated by self-interest and therefore cannot establish a communist society.

"When you are stretching really intensely, like when you wake up, why does your ability to hear diminish greatly?","You can't hear properly when you stretch because your eardrums are being pushed inward. You can't hear properly when you stretch because your eardrums are being pushed inward. The eardrum is the thin membrane that separates the outer ear canal from the middle ear. When the eardrum is pushed inward, the pressure inside the middle ear increases, which can cause discomfort or even pain. This is why you feel like your ears are going to pop when you are stretching. It's also why you can't hear properly when you stretch."
Why is it we feel very motivated towards the night and when waking up in the morning we don't have the same drive?," Wake up, take a shower, get dressed, go to work, go to class, go to the gym, do homework, cook dinner, watch TV, go to bed, repeat. It's not like we are doing anything exciting or even interesting. Yet, we do it every day. But what if we didn't? What if we decided to do something else instead?

"Why Stephen Hawking is the long-lived person with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), what is the difference between Him and the others with same disease?"," ALS is a progressive disease that affects the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. It is a rare disease that affects approximately 1 in 250,000 people worldwide. The disease is caused by a degeneration of the motor neurons in the spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement. These neurons are responsible for sending signals to muscles, and without these signals, the muscles cannot function. The motor neurons degenerate and eventually die, leading to a loss of muscle function. The disease is characterized by muscle weakness, muscle wasting, and twitching, and can eventually lead to paralysis. The disease is usually fatal, with most people dying within 3-5 years of diagnosis. The disease affects people of all ages and races, although it is more common in men than women. It is not known what causes ALS, although genetic mutations are a major risk factor. There is currently no cure for the disease, although there are several drugs available that can slow the progression of the disease. ALS is a disease that affects the nerves in the spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement. The nerves are responsible for sending signals to muscles telling them to move.  "

Why did antisemitism continue in the USA post WWII even though the horrors of the holocaust were known?,"Anti-Semitism was never fully gone in the US, but the Holocaust and WWII put a dent in it. The US had a large population of Jewish immigrants, many of whom were fleeing Europe. They settled in urban areas and were active in politics and business. This led to a lot of resentment from people who felt that the Jews were taking jobs away from them. Many of these people were also anti-communist and saw Jews as a threat to their way of life. The fact that many Jews were also active in the labor movement, and supported by the Communist Party, only added to the resentment. The US had a large number of Neo-Nazis who were active in the 1950s and 1960s, and some of them were involved in violence against Jews.

"How do weather stations know the ""feels like"" temperature of the windchill if thermometers only pick up the windless temperature?","They use a formula. The formula is called the wind chill index. It's used to estimate the apparent temperature. It's calculated by subtracting the wind chill from the actual temperature. The formula is based on the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, the wind speed in miles per hour, and the humidity in percentage. The formula is: 35.74 - 0.6215t - 0.3935t^2 - 0.0163t^3 - (0.006215t) \* (0.0001756t^2) - (0.00006215t) \* (0.0000006215t^2) - (0.00000006215t) \* (0.000000006215t^2) Where t is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, and the variables are the wind speed in miles per hour, and the humidity in percentage."

Why is a video taken from my phone camera a couple GB but a movie which is much longer is about the same size?,"The difference is that the movie is compressed. The video from your phone camera is uncompressed. The movie is compressed to make it easier to store and to save bandwidth. It's not just the length of the video, but the quality. Video is typically shot in 30 or 60 frames per second. That means that in 1 second of video, there are 30 or 60 individual images. It's not just the length, but the resolution and quality of the video that affects file size. If you're shooting at 1080p (1920x1080) then that means you have 1080 individual images per second. If you're shooting at 4k (3840x2160) then you have 3840 individual images per second. The higher the quality, the more data you need to store the video.

How does the brain perceive sound while asleep? Can it learn what to listen for?,"  brain does not ""hear"" in the classical sense. Hearing is the process of sound waves bouncing off of your eardrums and into your inner ear, where it is converted into electrical signals that are then transmitted to the brain.   brain can't hear anything when you're asleep because the part of your brain that controls hearing is not active.   brain does, however, have a part called the ""default mode network,"" which is active when you're not actively engaged in thinking or performing a task. It's thought that this network is responsible for things like daydreaming, mind-wandering, and creativity.

Why do NFL teams claim they cannot survive without a brand new state of the art stadium?,"- I am not sure how to answer this question. I am not a businessman, I am not a financial analyst, and I am not a sports fan. However, I can tell you that NFL teams do not really need new stadiums. In fact, most NFL stadiums are over 50 years old. The oldest stadium in the NFL is the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which was built in 1923. The oldest stadium in the NFL that is still in use is Ford Field in Detroit, which was built in 2002. The oldest stadium in the NFL that is still in use and has not been renovated is Soldier Field in Chicago, which was built in 1924. - There are a few reasons why NFL teams want new stadiums. One reason is that the NFL has a rule that teams can only play in a stadium for 50 years. That means that a team will have to move to a new stadium in 50 years. If the team does not move to a new stadium, it will have to pay a large penalty. Another reason is that the NFL is trying to make the stadiums more profitable. The NFL does not have to pay for the construction of the stadium, but it does have to pay for the upkeep of the stadium. The NFL also has to pay for the stadium to be renovated.  "
Why do people with tourettes syndrome with tics of swearing shout swear words rather than random words?," a person with Tourette Syndrome has an involuntary movement or sound that they make, called a tic. Tics can be of the body (like blinking, head jerking, or arm movement) or of the face (like grimacing, making a sound, or smacking the lips).

Why is it when im exhausted and collapse on my bed my heart races wildly for a few seconds?," Certainly, here's a long answer. When we sleep, our brain and body go through various stages of activity and rest. One of those stages is called REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. REM is the stage where we dream, and it's also the stage where our body does a lot of ""housekeeping."" That's when we repair and regenerate cells, strengthen muscles, and rebuild bone and tissue. REM is also when our body does a lot of ""flushing out"" of waste products, and our immune system does its job. So, when you're exhausted and collapse on your bed, your brain and body are in the middle of a lot of activity. That activity can be stressful, so it's normal for your heart rate to go up. That's just your body doing its job. You're not necessarily in danger, but it is a sign that you need to rest more. Your heart rate will come back down when you relax and rest. I hope this helps!"

The deactivation of Percocet,"is a complex process that involves multiple mechanisms. Drug deactivation is a multistep process that can involve one or more of the following steps: oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and enzymatic degradation. Oxidation is a process that involves the addition of oxygen to a molecule, which can result in the formation of reactive intermediates that can react with other molecules, including other drugs. Reduction is the opposite of oxidation and involves the removal of oxygen from a molecule. Hydrolysis is the process by which water is added to a molecule, which can result in the formation of reactive intermediates. Enzymatic degradation is the process by which enzymes break down drugs into smaller molecules. The deactivation of Percocet is a complex process that involves multiple mechanisms. The first step in the deactivation of Percocet is the hydrolysis of the acetaminophen component. Acetaminophen is hydrolyzed by the enzyme carboxylesterase 1, which is present in the liver. This results in the formation of the inactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).  "

Why radiation is so dangerous and how it sticks around for so long?,"Radiation is dangerous because it damages living cells. It does this by breaking their DNA, which is what holds the instructions for how the cell should behave. If a cell's DNA is damaged, it can't do its job, and the cell can't do its job, and the cell dies. Cells that die don't get replaced, so the tissue that they are in does not get replaced either. This is why radiation can cause long-term damage. It can cause damage that takes a long time to heal. It can also cause damage that is not easily healed."
"Why does that ""insert"" key that deletes your text as you type exist?"," Sounds like a good question to me. It's really interesting to see how many people don't understand why something like this exists. I'm going to try and answer this in a way that's as clear and concise as possible, but also tries to explain the reasoning behind it. So, I'm going to start with the assumption that the person asking the question is a native English speaker, because it's a lot easier to explain why this exists if you understand the language. Firstly, let's talk about the word ""insert"". It's a verb that means to put something into a particular place, usually in a physical sense. For example, if you were to insert a CD into a computer, you would mean to put it into the CD drive. Now, the reason why this word exists is because of the way the English language works. English has a lot of words that have a lot of different meanings, and sometimes those meanings can be very different from what you might expect. For example, ""bank"" can mean a financial institution, or a riverbank, or the side of a road. And ""insert"" is another word that has a lot of meanings, and it can be very confusing.

"What are the pros and cons to Globalism, from an (as much as possible) unbiased perspective?"," Certainly, I am not unbiased, but I try to be as objective as possible. Globalism is a complex and controversial topic that has many different perspectives, and I can only try to summarize some of the most common arguments. First, let's define what we mean by globalism. Globalism is a political ideology that advocates for the free movement of goods, services, and people across national borders. It is an economic policy that advocates for the free movement of capital, goods, and services across national borders, and it is a political policy that advocates for the free movement of people across national borders. Globalism has many different arguments, but I will summarize some of the most common ones. Pros: * Economic growth: Globalism advocates for free trade, which can increase economic growth and productivity. It also advocates for free movement of capital, which can increase investment in a country and help it attract foreign investors. * Job creation: Globalism can create jobs in the export sector, but it can also create jobs in the import sector. For example, a company that exports goods to another country needs employees to manage that export process, and a company that imports goods from another country needs employees to manage that import process. * Increased competition: Globalism can increase competition between companies, which can lead to better quality goods and services, and lower prices.

Why does string theory require 10 dimensions?,"The short answer is that we don't know. The long answer is that we don't know, but we can try to guess. In fact, we can try to guess in a very specific way. In string theory, the fundamental objects are not particles, but tiny strings. These strings can vibrate, and these vibrations are what give rise to the different particles. The vibrations are different frequencies, and different frequencies correspond to different particles. We can imagine that we are looking at a guitar string. If we pluck it, it will vibrate, and we can see the different frequencies. In string theory, the different frequencies are the different particles. So, we can ask ourselves: what happens if we pluck the string too many times? We know that the string can vibrate at different frequencies, but what if we pluck it so many times that it vibrates at a frequency that we can't see? In fact, we can imagine that there are particles that we can't see, because they vibrate at frequencies that are too high for us to see.   what if we pluck the string so many times that it vibrates at a frequency that we can't see, but we can feel? In fact, we can imagine that there are particles that we can't see, because they vibrate at frequencies that are too high for us to see.  "
Why is the number 'e' so important?,"nature and the universe, and the fundamental laws of physics that govern them. It is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It's an irrational number, which means that it cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction. For example, pi is approximately 3.14159. In mathematics, pi is a transcendental number, which means that it cannot be expressed as the root of any polynomial equation with rational coefficients. This means that pi cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction. Because of its unique properties, pi is used in many mathematical equations and calculations, particularly in geometry and trigonometry. It is also used in physics and engineering to calculate the circumference of circles, the area of circles and spheres, and the volume of spheres. In addition, pi is used in many other areas of science, such as computer science, statistics, and economics. The number pi is an irrational number, which means that it cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction. It is approximately 3.14159, but no matter how many digits you write down, there will always be more digits after the decimal point. The number pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle, and the diameter is the distance across the circle, from one side of the circle to the other."

What is a non newtonian fluid and what makes them special?,"A non-Newtonian fluid is one that does not follow Newton's Law of Viscosity, which states that the viscosity of a fluid is proportional to the force applied to it. A fluid that does not follow this law is called a non-Newtonian fluid. A non-Newtonian fluid will change its viscosity depending on the force applied to it. For example, a fluid that is more viscous when you push it harder. This can be useful in many situations, such as in medical applications where you want a fluid to be more viscous when you apply a certain amount of force. This can also be useful in engineering applications where you want a fluid to be more viscous when it is under pressure. It is important to study non-Newtonian fluids because it can help us understand the properties of fluids and how they behave under different conditions."

How would somebody create a new programming language?,"To create a new programming language, you need to define the syntax and semantics of the language. This means that you need to define what a program is, and what a program can do. For example, you need to define what a program is, how it can be written, how it can be compiled, what kind of data types it can have, what kind of operations it can perform, what kind of control structures it can have, how it can access memory, and how it can interact with other programs. The syntax and semantics of a language are defined by a set of rules. The rules define how a program is written, how it is compiled, and how it is executed. For example, the syntax of a language might specify that you can only use upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and punctuation, and that you must use the correct punctuation at the end of a line. The syntax might also specify that you must use the correct punctuation at the end of a line. The syntax might also specify that you can use the `if` statement, and that you can use the `while` statement. The syntax might also specify that you can use the `for` statement. The syntax might also specify that you can use the `function` statement, and that you can use the `class` statement.  "
Hunting Seasons," Why do they exist?
 Certainly, hunters have the right to hunt and the animals have the right to live. However, it is not as simple as that. In many parts of the world, hunting is a part of the culture. It is a way of life. In many places, hunting is the only way to obtain food. In other places, it is a way to maintain the population of certain animals. It is also a way to teach children about responsibility and conservation. Hunting is not just killing animals for sport. It is a way of life that has been practiced for centuries. The animals are not just game. They are living, breathing creatures. It is important to respect the animals and the environment. Hunting is a way to do that.

How do hostile takeovers on a company work?,"A hostile takeover is when a company is taken over without the consent of the board of directors. The board is the group of people that manage the company. If a company is taken over without their consent, it is a hostile takeover. In a hostile takeover, the company is taken over by another company or individual. The takeover is often done by buying a majority of shares. The company that is being taken over has to fight the takeover by either buying back the shares or convincing the shareholders to not sell. The company that is being taken over can also fight the takeover by going to court to stop the takeover. The person or company that is trying to take over the company is called the acquirer. The person or company that is being taken over is called the target company. The target company can fight the takeover by trying to convince the shareholders to not sell the shares. The target company can also try to convince the court to stop the takeover. If the takeover is successful, the target company will become part of the acquirer's company. If the target company is able to fight the takeover, the target company will remain independent."

How can someone be lost at sea with all of the technology and satellites we have now?,"Because you can't see it from where you are, or because you don't know how to use it. It's not like you can just call for help and then they show up. You need to know how to use it. And if you're out in the middle of the ocean, you might not have a phone signal to begin with. The problem is that it's hard to get a signal out there, especially in the middle of the ocean. There's a lot of water in the way. You'd need to be able to use a satellite phone or something, but if you're out there, you might not have that. It's also hard to get a signal out there because there's not a lot of land out there.

What is the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath?,"Sociopath and psychopath are often used interchangeably, but they are actually different. The term psychopath is older and was used to describe a personality disorder where a person lacks empathy and is unable to form normal relationships. It was originally used to describe people who were incapable of feeling emotions, and the term was used in a negative way. The term sociopath was introduced later and is used to describe a person who has a personality disorder where they lack empathy and are unable to form normal relationships, but they are not necessarily dangerous or violent. Sociopaths are often able to hide their disorder from others, and they can be successful in business and other areas of life. Psychopaths, on the other hand, are generally considered to be more dangerous and violent. They are often described as being unable to feel empathy, and they are often able to manipulate others and are able to get away with doing things that other people would be punished for."
Why hasn't the popularity of Warby Parker lowered the price of any other glasses brand?,"Because they are a business, and their business model relies on the price of their product.

Why does water taste bitter after eating pineapples?," Sour pineapple is a thing, and it’s not the fruit itself, it’s the bromelain. Bromelain is a protein that’s found in pineapple, and it’s a digestive enzyme. When you eat a pineapple, your body breaks it down into smaller pieces, and one of those pieces is bromelain. Bromelain is a digestive enzyme, and it can break down protein. When it’s in your mouth, it can break down some of the proteins in your saliva, and that’s what makes your mouth feel bitter. Bromelain can also cause your mouth to feel dry, which is why your mouth may feel dry after eating a pineapple. The other reason why pineapples taste bitter is because of the acidity of the fruit. Pineapples are acidic, and the acidity can make your mouth feel bitter. The acidity is also what makes the pineapple so sour. Pineapples are very acidic, and the acidity is what makes them so sour.

Some cemeteries will allow items to stay for a certain amount of time and then remove them. It depends on the cemetery. In the UK, it is illegal to leave anything on a grave, as it is considered disrespectful to the dead. The graves are regularly inspected and any items left on them are removed. It is not uncommon for people to leave flowers or small tokens on graves, but these are usually removed after a few days."
"when sea levels rise, do they do so by an equal amount across the globe?","The ocean doesn't expand. It just gets warmer.

How do air-conditioners work?," tldr; Air conditioners use the refrigeration cycle to remove heat from the air and transfer it outside. The cycle uses a refrigerant that changes state from liquid to gas and back again. The refrigerant is pumped through a compressor and a condenser, where it is compressed and heated. The hot gas is then cooled in the evaporator, causing it to turn back into a liquid. The process is repeated, removing heat from the air and transferring it outside.

"How do hard drives get bigger in capacity, but physically smaller in size?","Hard drives are made up of two things, the actual physical storage media, and the electronics that control the media. The electronics are what control how the media is accessed and read from. The actual physical storage media is what stores the data. The way that hard drives work is that they have a number of tiny magnets, that are arranged in a spiral, and are used to store data. As the electronics move the magnets, the magnets change the magnetic field, and this change in magnetic field is what stores the data. The way that the electronics control this is that they have a laser that is used to read the magnetic field. The laser is moved along the spiral as the electronics move the magnets. The laser reads the magnetic field and the electronics convert the magnetic field into an electrical signal. The way that hard drives are made bigger is by increasing the number of magnets that are arranged in the spiral. This means that more data can be stored on the same physical space. Hard drives are made of a magnetic material. The material is arranged in a spiral. The spiral is divided into tiny sectors. Each sector is read and written to by a laser. The laser moves along the spiral reading and writing to the sectors. The laser is controlled by electronics.  "

Why haven't the large space rocks in the Asteroid Belt and Kuiper belt coalesced to form large planets due to their gravity?,"The asteroid belt is a region of the solar system where a lot of small rocks are concentrated. It's not a place where planets form, but rather a place where rocks are ejected from the formation of the planets and then settle into the region. It's a bit like a big pile of rocks in a field. If you look at the rocks in the field, they don't look like they're going to make a big pile, but if you leave them there for a long time, eventually they will all pile up. The Kuiper belt is similar, but it's much farther away from the sun, so it has a lot more space to spread out in. The reason it's not noticed until now is because it's hard to see things that are very far away. It's a bit like trying to find a small rock in a big field.

why does splitting (sub-)atomic particles release SO much energy?,"The answer to this question is one of the most fundamental questions in physics. There are a lot of different answers to this question, and there is a lot of disagreement among physicists about which one is the right answer. I'm going to give you my own interpretation of the answer, but I want to make it clear that this is not an official answer. It's just my own opinion. The reason why splitting (sub-)atomic particles releases so much energy is that energy is not a fundamental thing in the universe. It's not something that is built into the universe. Instead, it's something that we create. Energy is simply the difference between what we have and what we want. When we split a subatomic particle, we create a difference between what we have and what we want. This difference is the energy that is released. We can also think of it as a difference between what we have and what we want. The energy is released when the difference between what we have and what we want becomes greater. When this happens, the difference between what we have and what we want becomes greater, and the energy is released."
Why is 'foo' and 'bar' used so much when explaining programming?,"Because they're easy to remember and don't have any inherent meaning. It's not uncommon for programmers to use names like 'foo' and 'bar' when writing code, and the use of these names has been around for a very long time. In fact, the first known use of 'foo' as a placeholder name is in the 1968 book ""The Art of Computer Programming"" by Donald Knuth. ""Bar"" was also used in Knuth's book as a placeholder name."
Why does the sensation of getting your head scratched from someone else feel better than scratching your own head?," Pain is a complicated thing. It is not just a sensation, but a complex reaction of the nervous system. When we experience pain, our body reacts by sending a signal to the brain, which then sends a signal to the relevant part of the body to stop whatever is causing the pain. The brain then reacts by sending a signal to the relevant part of the body to make it stop the pain, such as by reducing the amount of blood flow to the relevant area. When we scratch our head, the brain sends a signal to our arm to move in a way that will stop the pain. This is why the sensation of getting your head scratched from someone else feels better than scratching your own head. The brain is programmed to react to pain by moving the arm in a way that will stop the pain, but the brain can only react to pain that is perceived by the body. If you are scratching your own head, the brain does not perceive the pain because the brain is not receiving the signal from the nerves in your arm. When someone else scratches your head, the brain receives the signal from the nerves in your arm, and reacts by moving your arm in a way that will stop the pain. It is like the brain is programmed to react to pain by moving the arm in a way that will stop the pain, but the brain can only react to pain that is perceived by the body."
Why do countries (like the US) not include tax in their price tags?,"- In the US, we do have a federal sales tax, but it's relatively low. Some states have sales taxes, but not all. So, the price tag is the price tag. - In other countries, it's more common to have a tax on top of the price tag. But, it's not always the case. For example, in the UK, it's relatively common to have a VAT (Value Added Tax) of 20%. But, there are also some things that don't have a VAT, like food and medicine. - In some countries, it's the opposite. They don't have a sales tax, but they do have a tax on income. This means that the price tag is not the final price you pay. - Some countries also have a luxury tax, which is a tax on things like cars and yachts. - In some countries, it's not a tax, but a fee for using certain services. For example, in the UK, there's a fee for driving on the motorway. - In some countries, it's a combination of all of the above. - In some countries, it's just a different system. For example, in Sweden, the taxes are built into the price of the product, so you don't see a separate tax.  "

"Why do some people ""run hot"" while others ""run cold?"""," URL_0 )

Answer:
There is a genetic component to it, but it's also dependent on diet. The body needs a certain amount of fat to run properly, and when you don't have enough, you start to burn muscle and the fat you do have. You can run hot by running more efficiently and not burning muscle, but you can also run hot by eating more calories than you need. This is why you don't see marathon runners burning muscle, even though they're running long distances. They're running efficiently, so they're not burning muscle. The body has a thermostat, and when it gets hot enough, it shuts down. This is why you don't see people running in extreme heat. The body can't cool itself enough, so it shuts down. This is why marathon runners wear a lot of clothing, so they can stay cool. You can also run hot by running with a high heart rate. This is why you don't see marathon runners running with a high heart rate. They're running efficiently, so they don't need to run with a high heart rate. You can also run hot by eating more calories than you need. This is why you don't see marathon runners eating a lot.  "

"From a tap, why is a low-pressure stream clear, and a high-pressure stream white?"," W hen water is flowing out of a tap, the water pressure is constantly changing. In a city, the water pressure is usually regulated to a set pressure, and the water is sent out of the tap at that pressure. However, in a house, the pressure is not regulated, and it is constantly changing. The pressure is high when you first turn the tap on, but it quickly decreases. This is because there is a constant flow of water into the pipe from the city water supply, and the water in the pipe is constantly flowing out of the tap. This means that there is always a low pressure in the pipe, and this is why the water is clear. When you turn the tap off, the pressure in the pipe is high again, and this is why the water is white. The water is not clear when the pressure is high because there is a lot of air in the pipe. Air is a lot heavier than water, so it sinks to the bottom of the pipe and stays there. Since the water is clear when the pressure is low, it is clear when you turn the tap on. Since the water is white when the pressure is high, it is white when you turn the tap off."
why does looking at a bright light cause our eyes to feel pain?,"The sensation of pain is caused by the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters. The most common of these is called substance P. When light is shone into the eye, substance P is released in the retina. This substance then travels along the optic nerve and into the brain where it binds to receptors. These receptors are called nociceptors. Nociceptors are specialized cells that detect noxious stimuli such as heat, cold, and pain. When substance P binds to these receptors, it causes the release of other chemicals that cause the sensation of pain."
Why does water not always act as a lubricant?," In order to understand why water does not always act as a lubricant, we first need to understand what a lubricant is. A lubricant is a substance that reduces friction between two surfaces. In other words, it makes it easier for two things to move smoothly without rubbing against each other. A common example of a lubricant is oil. Oil is used to lubricate things like car engines and other machinery. It works by filling the spaces between the moving parts of the machine, and making it easier for them to move smoothly. When we look at water, we can see that it has some lubricating properties. For example, when you put a piece of paper in water, the water helps to reduce the friction between the paper and the surface of the water. This is why water is often used in washing machines. Water can also help to reduce the friction between your skin and other surfaces, which is why it is used in things like lotion and hand cream. However, there are some situations where water does not act as a lubricant. For example, if you put a piece of metal in water, the water will not help to reduce the friction between the metal and the surface of the water. This is because water is a very bad lubricant when it comes to metal.  "
Why do your hands tend to shake when you try to hold something still?,"When you hold something, you're exerting a force on it. The force you exert on it is transmitted through your bones and muscles, and your muscles have a natural tendency to try to oppose the force you're applying. This is known as ""resistance"". If you're holding a small object, your muscles can easily oppose the force you're applying, and so you're not going to notice the shaking. But if you're holding a larger object, your muscles have a harder time opposing the force you're applying. When this happens, your muscles will start to shake in an attempt to oppose the force you're applying."
Why do our tongues get stuck on poles.,"When you put your tongue on a smooth metal pole, the molecules on the surface of the metal are very far apart. The molecules on the surface of your tongue are very close together.   surface of the metal pole are pushed together. They are still very far apart compared to the molecules on your tongue, but they are closer together than they were before. This makes the surface of the metal pole sticky, so your tongue can't move off of it. When you put your tongue on a rough surface, the molecules on the surface of the rough surface are very close together. The molecules on the surface of your tongue are very close together. When you press your tongue on the rough surface, the molecules on the surface of the rough surface are pushed together. They are still very close together compared to the molecules on your tongue, but they are closer together than they were before. This makes the surface of the rough surface sticky, so your tongue can't move off of it. The reason that your tongue can't move off of a smooth metal pole is because the molecules on the surface of the metal pole are very far apart. The molecules on the surface of your tongue are very close together.  "
Why are multiple blades needed for a closer shave?,"The reason is that a single blade can only cut the hair on the surface. When you run the razor across the skin, the hair follicle is being pushed up and out of the way by the blade. The blade only cuts the hair on the surface, so if you were to use only one blade, you would have to push the blade into the skin to cut the hair. This is what causes razor burn and irritation."
"'Colon cancer','breast cancer', 'prostate cancer'... Do cancerous growths never originate in muscle tissues like arms or calves?","I'm not a doctor, but I'll try to give you a simplified explanation. Cancer is a disease where your body cells grow uncontrollably. This happens when something goes wrong with the DNA of your cells. DNA is like the blueprints of your body. When something goes wrong with the blueprints, the cells don't know how to work properly. Your body has different types of cells, and they all have different jobs. For example, red blood cells carry oxygen, white blood cells fight infections, and muscle cells make you move. When a cell grows uncontrollably, it can cause a tumor. A tumor is like a swollen cell that grows and grows. It can be benign or malignant. Benign means that the tumor is not cancerous, and it can't spread to other parts of your body. Malignant means that the tumor is cancerous, and it can spread to other parts of your body. Cancer can spread to other parts of your body through the bloodstream, lymphatic system, or by breaking through the tissues. Cancerous cells can also grow in different tissues, like the breast, colon, or prostate. This means that cancer can grow in different parts of your body, and it can have different symptoms.  "
"What safeguards are in place, in the U.S.A., to stop a rogue president from using nuclear weapons?","The President is not authorized to use nuclear weapons unless Congress has declared war. In addition, there are many safeguards in place to prevent the President from launching nuclear weapons. One of the most important is the requirement that the President consult with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense before launching a nuclear attack.

Isn't that why the immune system is a) there and b) adaptive?,"The immune system is a defense against viruses, not bacteria. It's not adaptive. It's a set of rules that your body has learned to follow over time. It's not going to learn new things. It's not going to adapt. It's going to follow the rules it was taught. And if it was taught wrong, or if the rules it was taught are no longer correct, then it's going to fail. The immune system is designed to work with the cells of the body to defend against viruses.

Troops in Poland. Why are they needed or why are they so happy we were there?,"The US military has a long history of stationing troops in Poland, dating back to the end of World War II. The US has stationed troops there as part of a mutual defense treaty between the two countries. This treaty was signed in 1990 and was meant to be a way to reassure Poland that the US would defend it in case of an attack from the Soviet Union. In 1999, Poland joined NATO and the US troops stationed there were integrated into NATO's military command structure. The US has about 4,500 troops stationed in Poland today. The US troops in Poland are a reminder to the Russian government that the US is committed to defending Poland and is willing to do so with military force. The US troops are also part of a NATO military force that is stationed in Eastern Europe, which is meant to be a deterrent to Russian aggression in the region. The US troops in Poland are not part of any ongoing conflict and are not needed to fight a war. They are there to deter aggression and to reassure Poland that the US will defend it if it is attacked. They are also there to provide training and support to the Polish military."

"How does externally applied ""fat burning"" gels work?"," tl;dr - They don't. 😔 Edit: I've been asked to explain the science behind this, so I'll try my best. There are some really great explanations in the comments already, but I'll add my two cents. The idea behind fat burning gels is that they contain some ingredients that can stimulate fat metabolism. Some of these ingredients are: * Caffeine: stimulates fat metabolism (burning fat for energy instead of carbohydrates). * Green tea extract: contains catechins (antioxidants) that can stimulate fat metabolism. * L-carnitine: helps to transport fatty acids into the mitochondria (the energy-producing part of cells). * Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB): helps to reduce muscle damage and promote fat metabolism. * Green coffee bean extract: contains chlorogenic acid, which can help to reduce glucose absorption and promote fat metabolism. * Yohimbine: stimulates fat metabolism and can help to reduce body fat. * Forskolin: stimulates fat metabolism. * Glucomannan: helps to reduce hunger and promote fat metabolism.

Why do we feel extremely weak right before throwing up?,"]( URL_0 ) > 🤔 2 years ago 🔍 We do not have a specific answer to this question, but there are a few theories. 1.   reflex is triggered by the brain when it senses that the body is under stress, and the body's response to stress is to release hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones are meant to help the body prepare for the fight or flight response, which is the body's response to danger. When the body is under stress, it releases these hormones, which causes the body to release glucose from its stores into the bloodstream. This glucose is meant to provide the body with energy for the fight or flight response. 2.   reflex is triggered by the brain when it senses that the body is under stress, and the body's response to stress is to release hormones like cortisol and adrenaline.

"Why is it sometimes easy to peel a hard-boiled egg, while other times the shell sticks and fragments into bazillions of tiny pieces?"," Different people have different answers, but here is one possible explanation: The egg shell is made up of proteins and minerals. When the egg is boiled, the proteins and minerals are heated and vaporize, and then condense into the air. This is what makes the shell soft and easy to peel. However, if the egg is not cooked long enough, the proteins and minerals do not have enough time to vaporize and condense. In this case, the shell is still hard and difficult to peel. The same thing happens to the egg white and yolk, but in a different way. The egg white is made up of proteins, which are heated and vaporized, and then condense into the air. This is what makes the egg white firm and white. The yolk is made up of proteins and fats, which are heated and vaporized, and then condense into the air. This is what makes the yolk firm and yellow. If the egg is not cooked long enough, the proteins and fats do not have enough time to vaporize and condense, and the yolk is still soft and yellow.

How are people able to trick themselves into remembering something that never happened?," We have two types of memory: short term and long term. Short term memory is what we remember for a very short time, usually a few seconds or minutes. Long term memory is what we remember for a longer time, usually years or a lifetime. When we are young, our short term memory is much better than our long term memory. As we age, our short term memory declines and our long term memory improves. This means that we are more likely to forget things from our short term memory and remember things from our long term memory. One way to trick ourselves into remembering something that never happened is to tell ourselves that it did happen. We can do this by rehearsing the memory in our mind. The more we rehearse a memory, the more we will remember it. This is why people often remember things that happened to them when they were young. They have rehearsed the memory so many times that it becomes a part of their long term memory. Another way to trick ourselves into remembering something that never happened is to believe that it happened. This is why people often believe that they have seen something that they have not seen.   of their long term memory. This is also why people often believe that they have experienced something that they have not experienced.  "

Why do museums prohibit taking pictures with flash on even though the artifacts are exposed to natural and other lights the whole day?," I am not a museum professional, but I think I can give you a good answer. The reason museums prohibit flash photography is to protect the artwork. The light from the flash can damage the artwork in a few ways: 1. Heat: The flash produces a lot of heat. If the light is pointed directly at the artwork, the heat can damage the artwork. 2.   Flashlights produce a lot of UV light, which can damage the artwork. 3. Reflected light: The flashlight can reflect off of the artwork, damaging it. There are a few ways to get around this: 1. Take pictures without the flash. 2. Use a tripod or other stabilizer to keep the camera still. 3. Use a remote shutter release to avoid touching the camera. 4. Use a camera with a low-power flash or turn it off. 5. Take pictures of the artwork from a distance. I am not a museum professional, but I think I can give you a good answer. The reason museums prohibit flash photography is to protect the artwork.

This makes the water more ""dirty"" and less pure. Over time, this can make the water taste bad and become less healthy to drink. The rate at which this happens depends on many factors. Water that is bottled and sealed is not going to have the same rate of reaction as water that is sitting in a glass in your kitchen sink. Water that is purified through a filter will have a lower rate of reaction than water that is just sitting in a container."

Why we don't create our own energy for free using magnets? youtube video below,"Because it is extremely difficult to generate enough energy to make it worth it. The video is explaining that if we could generate a magnetic field strong enough to create a lot of electricity, we could do it for free. The problem is that it is extremely difficult to generate a magnetic field strong enough to generate enough electricity. It would take a huge amount of energy to generate that magnetic field, and it would be very difficult to store that energy. The video is using the example of a superconductor, which is a material that is able to conduct electricity without losing any energy. The video is saying that if we could find a way to make a superconductor that was able to store a lot of energy, we could use that to generate electricity. The problem is that we don't know how to do that yet. We have tried using superconductors to generate electricity, but it doesn't work very well. We have also tried using superconductors to store energy, but it doesn't work very well. We are still working on finding a way to make a superconductor that can store a lot of energy. This is very difficult because superconductors are very sensitive to temperature.  "
"ٌWhat is the most important factor someone's larynx have in order to make one have a ""powerful voice""?"," Larynx is the vocal organ that is responsible for the production of voice. It is a cartilaginous structure located in the neck, just below the pharynx. It contains two vocal cords, which are folds of mucous membrane that vibrate to produce sound. The vocal cords are surrounded by the laryngeal prominence, which is a cartilaginous structure that provides a frame for the vocal cords. The larynx also contains the epiglottis, which is a flap of mucous membrane that separates the larynx from the pharynx. The epiglottis acts as a valve to prevent food from entering the larynx. The larynx is also surrounded by a number of muscles that control the opening and closing of the vocal cords. These muscles are responsible for the pitch and tone of the voice. The larynx is connected to the trachea by the glottis, which is an opening that allows air to pass through. The larynx is also connected to the esophagus by the esophageal opening. The larynx is surrounded by a number of cartilages that provide support for the vocal cords. The cartilages are made of collagen, which gives them their strength. The cartilages also provide a framework for the muscles that control the vocal cords."

Why is the average work week so much higher in the United States at 34.40 hours per week in comparison to other countries such as Germany where the average person works 26.37 hours per week?,"In the US, the work week is 40 hours, not 34.4. That's the number of hours you work per week. The 40 hour number is what's considered full time. I'm not sure why you'd be looking at 34.4, but that's not the number we're working with. In the US, we work 40 hours a week. That's considered full time. It's not that people work 40 hours a week in other countries, it's that they work less hours overall. In the US, we have a lot of people who work more than 40 hours a week. In fact, 1 in 4 Americans work more than 40 hours a week. So, in short, it's because we work a lot more than other countries. It's not because we work 40 hours a week, but because we work more hours overall."

Why do so many Train tracks run along creeks and rivers?,The reason for this is that the early train tracks were made by the railroad companies who were trying to get the trains from the coal mines in the mountains to the factories and cities in the valleys. The railroad companies would build the tracks along the valleys so they could be as close as possible to the cities. The railroad companies also wanted to use the water to help power the trains. The creeks and rivers provided the water to power the trains. The railroad companies would build their tracks along the creeks and rivers so they could use the water to power their trains.
Why is it bad to quickly restart an air conditioner compressor?,"It’s a big motor and it’s got a lot of parts and stuff inside that can get damaged if it’s turned on and off too many times. It’s like a car engine, you can’t just keep turning it off and on and on and expect it to last forever. It’s a machine and it needs to be treated with respect. If you can, it’s better to just let it run for a while and then shut it off. It’s also better to let it run for a while and then turn it off and on, then let it run again. This is because the motor and parts inside the compressor are designed to work better when they get a little hot. So, they work better when they are running. So, if you turn it off and then on again, it will work better and last longer."
Why does the tempo of a certain song seem so different depending on activity level when listening?,"When listening to music you are not actively doing anything else, your brain is free to focus on the music. When you are doing something else your brain is divided between the music and the activity. This can make the music seem faster or slower depending on the activity. For example if you are listening to a song while driving it might seem faster because your brain is divided between the music and driving. If you are listening to a song while exercising it might seem slower because your brain is focused on the exercise."
What is the deal with the newly discovered organ? How come we didn't categorize it before?,"1. It's not a new organ.

Why do we only breathe through one nostril at a time and why do some people breathe through both,"It is because we have a muscle that can close off one nostril and it is controlled by the brain. It is called the nasal dilator muscle. It is located in the nasal cavity. The nasal dilator muscle is controlled by the brain via the vagus nerve. This is the nerve that runs from the brain to the abdomen and it has a big impact on our respiratory system. When we breathe in, the nasal dilator muscle contracts and narrows the nasal passages. This makes it easier for the air to move into the lungs. When we breathe out, the nasal dilator muscle relaxes and the nasal passages expand. This makes it easier for the air to move out of the lungs. When we are in a state of relaxation, the brain sends a signal to the nasal dilator muscle to contract. This is why we breathe through one nostril at a time when we are relaxed. When we are stressed, the brain sends a signal to the nasal dilator muscle to relax and open up both nostrils. This is why we breathe through both nostrils when we are stressed. This is called nasal cycling."

Why do we sometimes experience tremendous mood shifts based upon music?," We know that music affects the brain and that it can be used to treat certain mental disorders. But why does it affect us in this way? How do we perceive music as something that can make us feel so many different emotions? It's all to do with the way that music is processed in the brain. When we hear music, it is initially processed in the auditory cortex, which is responsible for processing sound. But it doesn't stop there. Music also activates the brain's reward system, which is responsible for processing pleasure. In fact, music is the only stimulus that can activate the brain's reward system without actually being a reward. In other words, music can make us feel good without actually giving us anything that we need. This is why music is so powerful. It can make us feel good, but it also has the power to make us feel bad. Music is processed in the brain in a way that's similar to how we process emotions. It's processed in a way that's similar to how we process memories. It's processed in a way that's similar to how we process pain. Music is processed in a way that's similar to how we process everything that we experience. And this is why music can be so powerful. It can make us feel good, but it can also make us feel bad.  "

Why do people seem upset at the price of products in their country vs others (like the Nintendo Switch being $300 US and $400 CAD) when in fact those prices are nearly identical with exchange rates?,"I think it has to do with the psychology of a price. For example, if you have a product with a price of $100, it seems like a fair price. But if you then see a price tag of $99, it seems like a good deal. So you might buy it. But if you see a price tag of $101, it seems like a bad deal. So you might not buy it. This is why stores will sometimes lower the price of a product to $99 to make it seem like a good deal. It is also why stores will sometimes raise the price of a product to $101 to make it seem like a bad deal. This is why people are upset when they see a price tag that is $100. They think it should be $99. But when they see a price tag that is $101, they think it should be $100. So they are upset. People often have a preconceived idea of what something should cost, and that price is not the same as what they expect it to cost. In the case of the Nintendo Switch, it is a product that is new, so people don't have a preconceived idea of what it should cost. They think it should be cheap. But it is expensive. So they are upset."

"Where did the expression ""paint the town red"" come from? Why the color red?","   the idea of a person painting the town red with their blood in the event of a violent death. The idea was that the town would be covered in red paint. The phrase ""paint the town red"" has been around since the 19th century. The most popular explanation is that it has something to do with a violent death, where the blood of the victim would stain the town red. This is supported by the fact that the phrase has been used to describe a town that has been ""painted red"" by the blood of a murdered person. But there are other theories as well. One of them is that the phrase has to do with the fact that red is a color that is associated with passion, love, and lust. In the 19th century, red was also a color that was associated with prostitution and brothels. So, the idea is that the phrase is describing a town that is ""painted red"" by the passion and lust of its inhabitants. But the most popular explanation is probably the violent death one.

Why do we use numerals of base 10 and base 2? Are there any systems with a different base?," In base 10 we have 10 digits (0-9) and we can represent any number by combining these digits. For example 1234567890. In base 2 we have 2 digits (0-1) and we can represent any number by combining these digits. For example 1010101010. We use base 10 because it is the most practical system for humans to use. It is easy to read and write, and it is easy to do calculations with. In base 2 we use binary because it is the most efficient way to store information. A binary digit is either 0 or 1 and it is easy to store this digit on a computer chip. For example, a computer chip can store 1024 bits and this is easy to do because the bits are just 0 or 1. If we tried to use a system with 1024 digits it would be very hard to store the information on a chip."

"How can there be transparent animals, e.g. some fish and frogs. How can they have transparent muscles?","In animals that have transparent skin, like fish, the skin is made up of cells that are not very thick. These cells have a very thin membrane that separates the inside of the cell from the outside. The cells are also filled with fluid, which helps to keep them flexible and strong. The cells are also surrounded by a thin layer of proteins, which helps to keep them from being damaged. When light hits the cells, it is reflected off of the thin membrane, and the proteins in the cells help to reflect the light. This is why the cells look transparent. In animals with transparent muscles, the muscles are made up of cells that are very thin and flexible. These cells are also filled with fluid, and they are surrounded by a thin layer of proteins.

Why does processed food cost less than organic food when it seems to cost more to produce?,"There are a lot of reasons why processed food costs less than organic food. One of the main reasons is that it is produced in higher quantities. Processed food is also often produced in places where it is cheaper to do so. For example, a lot of processed food is produced in China, where labor is cheaper than in the US or Europe. Processed food is also often produced in places where the food is cheaper to produce. For example, a lot of processed food is produced in places where corn and soy are cheaper to produce than in the US or Europe. Because processed food is produced in higher quantities and in places where it is cheaper to produce, it is cheaper to produce than organic food. This means that it costs less for the farmer to produce processed food than it does to produce organic food. This means that the farmer can sell processed food for less than he can sell organic food. This means that the consumer can buy processed food for less than he can buy organic food. This is why processed food costs less than organic food."
"How do sin, cos, tan and their reciprocals work with angles that are multiples of 90? It seems like the opposite and adjacent wouldn't even be a part of the problem, but that's not what the results say...","It is true that sine, cosine and tangent are all periodic functions with a period of 90 degrees, so if you take a multiple of 90 degrees and divide it by 90, you will get a value that is a multiple of 1/90. So for example, 180 degrees divided by 90 is 2, which is a multiple of 1/90. This is the same as 180 degrees divided by 180, which is 1. So the function is periodic with a period of 90 degrees. This is why sine, cosine and tangent are called trigonometric functions, because they are related to the angles of a triangle. The angle of a triangle is related to the lengths of the sides of the triangle. The trigonometric functions are related to the angles of the triangle, and the reciprocal of the trigonometric functions are related to the lengths of the sides of the triangle. So if you know the length of one side of the triangle, you can use the trigonometric functions to find the length of the opposite side, and if you know the length of one side and the length of the opposite side, you can use the reciprocal trigonometric functions to find the angle of the triangle.

What is the difference in a muscle strain/pull and normal fatigue from working out. Why does one heal so much faster.,"Muscle strains are when the muscle fibers are damaged, which is usually caused by sudden overstretching or tearing of the muscle. This is what causes the pain. This is a different mechanism of injury than muscle fatigue, which is caused by overuse. When muscles are overused, the fibers are damaged but the injury is not as severe as a strain. Muscle fatigue is caused by overstimulation of the muscle fibers, and it is usually accompanied by muscle spasms. Muscle strains heal faster because they are not as severe as muscle fatigue. Muscle fatigue is usually accompanied by swelling and inflammation, which causes the muscle to be tender to the touch and difficult to move. Muscle strains do not have this inflammation, and therefore, do not have the same pain. Muscle strains can also be caused by micro tears in the muscle fibers, which is caused by overstretching or tearing of the muscle. This is a different mechanism of injury than muscle fatigue, which is caused by overuse. This is why muscle strains can heal faster than muscle fatigue."

How does soaking in Epsom salts help heal an injury?," We know that Epsom salts are rich in magnesium, which is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in the healing process. Magnesium is a natural anti-inflammatory, which is why it can help reduce swelling and inflammation in the body. This is especially important for athletes, as inflammation can slow down the healing process and impede recovery. Epsom salts also contain sulfates, which can help flush toxins out of the body and improve circulation. This is important for athletes because toxins can build up in the body, which can impede recovery and cause muscle cramps. Epsom salts also contain calcium, which is important for muscle contractions and relaxation. This is why they can help reduce muscle cramps and spasms.   reduce swelling and inflammation in the body.

Why is evidence found illegally by police inadmissible in court?,"So that the police can't use evidence found illegally to charge someone with a crime. So if the police found evidence that would charge someone with a crime, the police would be guilty of breaking the law to get that evidence. If the police found evidence that would exonerate someone, the police would be guilty of breaking the law to keep that evidence from being used. So the law says that the police can't use evidence found illegally to charge someone with a crime. It's the same reason why police can't make someone confess to a crime. If the police could use evidence found illegally to charge someone with a crime, then the police could use evidence found illegally to get a confession from someone.

Is the US actually able to recover from the debt it's in?," Paper debt is debt in the form of paper, like a dollar bill. It's not like the US government has a big pile of paper debt sitting around. It's more like a promise to pay. In the US, the government is able to pay its debts, but it's not always able to pay them in a timely manner. The US government is able to pay its debts because it's a sovereign nation. It can print money, and it has the power to force people to pay taxes. That's how the US government is able to pay its debts. The US government can pay its debts by printing money, and then paying off its debts with the money it printed. This is called inflation. Inflation is when the value of money goes down. Inflation is a problem because it means that the money you have now won't be worth as much later. The US government has been printing money for a long time. If the US government continues to print money, the value of money will go down, and inflation will continue to be a problem. This is why the US government is trying to reduce its debt. It's not really a problem, but it's a problem because people are worried about it. The US government can't pay its debts because it doesn't have enough money.  "

How do health insurance companies know you have a preexisting condition.,"/---]  Insurance companies have a lot of information about you that they use to determine your rates. One of the most important factors is your health history. If you have a pre-existing condition, you may have been denied coverage or been charged a higher premium. There are a few ways that insurance companies can determine if you have a pre-existing condition: 1. You tell them. When you apply for insurance, you'll be asked to fill out a questionnaire that asks about your medical history. You'll be asked if you have any pre-existing conditions, and if so, you'll be asked to list them. 2. Your doctor tells them. Your doctor will also be asked to provide information about your medical history. Your doctor will be asked to indicate if you have any pre-existing conditions. 3. They look at your medical records. Insurance companies have access to your medical records. They can look at your medical history and determine if you have any pre-existing conditions. 4. They use algorithms. Insurance companies use algorithms to determine your risk level. These algorithms take into account a variety of factors, including your age, your gender, your location, your occupation, your income, and your medical history. 5. They use data from other insurance companies. Insurance companies share data with each other.  "
Why are car manufacturers doing away with traditional gear shifts?,"The 3-pedal system is the most efficient way to transfer power to the wheels. It's not just about the gearbox. Modern cars use a lot of electric motors. These motors are very efficient at low speeds. But the electric motor isn't very efficient at high speeds. So, to balance the efficiency of the electric motor, you need to make the engine work harder. And the best way to do that is to make the engine work at a higher RPM. But, that's exactly the opposite of what you want to do to reduce fuel consumption. So, you can't just make the engine work harder, you also need to make the gearbox work harder. And that means you need more gears. You can't just have 4 gears and a 5th gear for overdrive. You need 6 gears. 7 gears. 8 gears. 9 gears. 10 gears. And that's a lot of complexity. And a lot of cost. And it's not just the gearbox. You also need to make the engine more efficient.   engine smaller. But, smaller engines are less powerful. So, you need to make the engine more powerful.  "
"What physically is current, and what is charge - why do they move in opposite directions in an electrical circuit.","Current is the flow of charge. The flow of charge is caused by the movement of charged particles (electrons) in a conductor. In order to understand why they move in opposite directions, you need to know a bit about electric fields. In an electric field, positive charges are attracted to the center of the field, and negative charges are attracted to the edge. The electric field is created by the presence of charged particles, and the strength of the field depends on the amount of charge present. If you imagine a charged particle moving through an electric field, it will be deflected by the field, and the amount of deflection will depend on the amount of charge present. If you imagine a large number of charged particles moving through the field, they will move in the direction that is perpendicular to the field. This is because the field will act on each particle in the same way, and the sum of all the particles will be zero. This is why they move in opposite directions."
Why haven't all primates entered the stone age yet?," tl;dr: Because they're not as smart. The reason humans are able to use tools is because of our intelligence. Our intelligence allows us to create tools and use them for our advantage. Other primates are not as intelligent as humans, and therefore they don't have the same ability to use tools. They are also not as social, and therefore they don't have the same need to use tools. Humans are social animals, so we use tools to communicate, hunt, and defend ourselves. Other primates are not as social, and therefore they don't have the same need to use tools. Humans also have a large brain, which allows us to be more intelligent and create more advanced tools. Other primates have smaller brains, and therefore they are not as intelligent and cannot create as advanced tools. Humans are also able to use tools for many different things, such as hunting, farming, and building. Other primates are not as intelligent, and therefore they do not have the same ability to use tools for many different things. We are also able to use tools in many different environments, such as the forest, desert, and mountains. Other primates are not as intelligent, and therefore they do not have the same ability to use tools in many different environments. Finally, humans have a more advanced culture and technology, which allows us to use tools in a more advanced way.  "
What is Bose Einstein Condensate and how does it look like?,"Bose Einstein Condensate is a state of matter that occurs when a gas of bosons is cooled to very low temperatures. The Bosons are particles that have integer spin, and are therefore identical particles. Bosons include things like photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons. In a normal gas, the atoms are moving randomly and have a lot of energy. In a Bose Einstein Condensate, the atoms are moving in a coordinated way, and have very little energy. The atoms are all in the same state, so they are all the same. This is a very unusual state of matter, and it's the lowest energy state that is possible."
Why is it sleep deprivation can sometimes be euphoric and other times it's wretched?

When you get enough sleep, you pay it off. When you don't, it piles up. Eventually, you'll pay it off, but the longer you go without sleep, the more you'll have to pay.   like having a debt, and you can't avoid paying it forever. When you're in a state of sleep deprivation, you can't get a good nights sleep. You're either up all night thinking, or you can't sleep because you're worried about not sleeping. This can make you feel more awake and alert, and it can also make you feel more irritable and grumpy.

Why does toast bread keep all the cheese in while normal bread lets the cheese ooze out?,"When you toast bread, the cheese melts and the bread absorbs it. This is because the toasting process heats the bread enough to melt the cheese and the cheese is absorbed by the bread. The cheese will ooze out of bread that is not toasted because the cheese does not melt and the bread does not absorb it."
how do muscles push?," In physics, we have a law called the Newton's second law, which states that force = mass x acceleration. In other words, if you apply a force on an object, it will accelerate in proportion to its mass and in the opposite direction to the force. In the case of muscles, the force is the tension in the muscle fibers, which is generated by the contraction of the muscle cells. The mass is the total mass of all the muscle fibers, which can be estimated by multiplying the number of fibers by their average mass per fiber. The acceleration is the movement of the bone, which is caused by the muscle contraction. The direction of the force is in the opposite direction to the movement of the bone. So if you move your arm, your muscles contract to push your arm forward, and the force is in the opposite direction to the movement."
Does my breastmilk have healthier properties if I eat healthier food?,"You can. It is a little tricky though. The fat molecules in the milk are the same as the fat molecules in the food you eat. So the fat molecules in your milk are going to be very similar to the fat molecules in your food. However, your body is a very complex system. It can take the fat molecules you eat and use them to make a fat molecule that is a little different. This is called the ""lipidome"". This is the collection of all the different fat molecules in your body. This is the collection of all the different fat molecules in your body. So, if you eat a lot of fatty foods, then your body will make a lot of fatty molecules. But if you eat a lot of healthy foods, then your body will make a lot of healthy fatty molecules. There is a lot of research on this. One study found that if you eat a lot of healthy foods, then your body will make a lot of healthy fatty molecules. The healthy fatty molecules in your milk are the same as the healthy fatty molecules in your food. So the healthy fatty molecules in your milk are the same as the healthy fatty molecules in your food. But, the healthy fatty molecules in your milk are a little different.  "

If you don't get enough energy, you start to shut down. You'll feel weak and tired, and you might start to hallucinate. If you don't get enough food, you'll eventually start to die. But if you get some food, you'll be able to keep going for a little while. Your body will keep using up the food you have, but eventually you'll run out. If you have some food left, you'll be able to keep going for a little longer. But eventually, you'll run out of food. Then you'll die. So you want to keep going for as long as you can, so you can find more food. This is why people who are starving to death still crave for food. They're still trying to find more food."

"why aren't ovens white on the inside? Since black absorbs heat the best, wouldn't that be the worst color?","The color of the oven is actually a reflection of the temperature of the oven. The black color reflects the heat back into the oven, keeping it hot. The white color absorbs the heat and reflects it back out, so the oven is cooler. The reason the oven is not white is that it would be very hot to touch, and it would be very hard to see what you were doing inside the oven. Black is actually the best color for a cooking oven because it absorbs heat very well. But it's also very hot to touch, and it's hard to see what you're doing inside the oven. So the oven is painted with a special white paint that reflects heat back into the oven. This makes the oven hotter on the inside and colder on the outside, which is important for cooking."

;What exactly is meant by Bismarckian and machevellian politics. What are good examples of their actions that brought about these terms?,"Bismarckian politics is a term used to describe the way in which Otto von Bismarck, the chancellor of Prussia, governed Germany. Bismarck was a master of diplomacy and was able to use it to his advantage in order to achieve his goals.   was able to get what he wanted through a combination of cunning, manipulation, and brute force. Bismarckian politics is characterized by a focus on the state and its interests, and the willingness to take whatever steps are necessary to achieve those interests. Bismarckian politics is also associated with the idea of ""Realpolitik,"" or the idea that the only thing that matters is what is real, and not what is ideal or what is right. Bismarck's most famous example of this is his ""Kulturkampf,"" or cultural struggle, which was a series of policies that he implemented in order to weaken the Catholic Church in Prussia.   did this because he saw the Church as a threat to the power of the state, and he wanted to eliminate that threat. Machiavellian politics is a term used to describe the way in which Niccolò Machiavelli, an Italian political philosopher, governed Italy. Machiavelli was a master of manipulation and was able to use it to his advantage in order to achieve his goals.  "

What makes certain foods cancerous?," Fruits and vegetables are rich in antioxidants, which are compounds that help to neutralise free radicals, which are highly reactive molecules that can damage cells and contribute to cancer. For example, the pigments in red peppers and tomatoes are called lycopene and beta-carotene, respectively. These pigments have been shown to have antioxidant properties and may reduce the risk of cancer. Other compounds in fruits and vegetables that may have antioxidant properties include vitamin C, vitamin E, and polyphenols. In addition to being rich in antioxidants, fruits and vegetables also contain other compounds that may reduce the risk of cancer. For example, the phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, may have anti-cancer properties. The phytochemicals in these vegetables are thought to interfere with the activity of enzymes that are involved in the growth and progression of cancer cells. Other compounds in fruits and vegetables that may have anti-cancer properties include the flavonoids in citrus fruits, the anthocyanins in blueberries and raspberries, and the isothiocyanates in cruciferous vegetables.

why do light bulbs only seem to ever go out when turning them on instead of while they're already on?,"Because it's not a perfect vacuum. There are always tiny particles floating around. When you turn the light on, the filament heats up and glows, and the heat causes the particles in the air to move. Some of those particles hit the filament, causing it to burn out. If you turn the light on, it's still in the middle of the filament, so the particles are more likely to hit it. If you turn it off, the filament has cooled down, so the particles have less of a chance of hitting it."
Why does sticking out your tongue help you concentrate?,"It's a reflex. When you stick out your tongue, your brain sends a signal to the muscles in your tongue to move. This causes your tongue to move into a position that is more likely to be used when you're speaking, and so it's easier for you to focus on the task at hand. It's a reflex, similar to blinking."
How do internet startups get a big user base before they are well known?,"Well known or not, if you have a good product that solves a problem, people will find you. The internet is a very powerful tool, and if you have a good product, you can attract users very quickly. Just look at how quickly Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram grew. They were not well known at all before they became popular."
Why do millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did at same stage of life?,"It's a complicated question. But basically, it's because the value of money has changed. In the 60's and 70's, the minimum wage was 0.25 cents an hour. Now it's $7.25 an hour. That's a huge increase in purchasing power. But it's not just the minimum wage. It's the cost of everything else. In the 60's and 70's, a house cost about 30,000 dollars. Now it's about 200,000 dollars. And that's just in the US. In other countries, it's even more extreme. But that's not the only factor. In the 60's and 70's, people were less likely to have a college degree. And even if they did, they were less likely to graduate. So, even though they were making less, they were less likely to have to spend money on college. Now, it's a lot more common to have a college degree. And a lot more common to graduate. So, even though they're making more, they're spending more on college. And that means they're making less."
"How do people calculate the energy, fat, protein, carbohydrates, and sodium?","A lot of it is based on the chemical composition of the food. For example, proteins have a lot of nitrogen and oxygen in them, which can be used to calculate the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in a food sample. Similarly, carbohydrates have a lot of carbon and hydrogen in them, and proteins have a lot of carbon and nitrogen in them. Fats are just a lot of carbon and hydrogen. Fat is a type of macronutrient. It’s a macronutrient because it’s not a vitamin or mineral, and it’s a macronutrient because it’s a large molecule that comes from the food we eat.

"Why can you hold water, or any liquid, in a straw by placing your finger over the opening?","You can hold water in a straw because the pressure inside the straw is lower than the pressure outside the straw. The pressure outside is atmospheric pressure, which is about 1000 times higher than the pressure inside the straw. If you hold your finger over the straw, the pressure inside the straw is higher than the pressure outside the straw. This means that the water molecules in the straw are moving faster than the water molecules outside the straw. The faster molecules are moving, the more energy they have, so the faster they move. This is called ""kinetic energy"". When you hold your finger over the straw, the molecules inside the straw have more kinetic energy than the molecules outside the straw. This means that the molecules inside the straw are moving faster than the molecules outside the straw. When you hold your finger over the straw, the faster moving molecules inside the straw are pushing on the slower moving molecules outside the straw. This is called ""pressure"". The faster moving molecules are pushing on the slower moving molecules, so the slower moving molecules are moving faster than they would be if your finger weren't there.  "
Why do we stretch?," Skeletal muscles are made up of long, thin fibers, and they are capable of stretching. Stretching is a mechanical phenomenon that occurs when the fibers are pulled apart, and the elastic properties of the muscle fibers are utilized to return the muscle to its resting length. The elastic properties of muscle fibers are dependent on their chemical composition. The elastic properties of muscle fibers are dependent on their chemical composition. The elastic properties of muscle fibers are dependent on the cross-sectional area of the fiber and the concentration of actin and myosin filaments within the fiber.

Why do we puke when we get too dizzy?,"I’m not an expert, but I do know that when we are dizzy we are unable to focus our eyes on one point, and so we are unable to use our vision to keep us upright. Instead, we rely on our vestibular system, which is a system of fluid filled canals in the inner ear that detects changes in the position of the head. When we are dizzy, the fluid in these canals is moving much faster than it should be, and this movement is what makes us feel like we are spinning. When we are dizzy, our body is trying to fight this sensation of spinning by making us vomit. This is because vomiting causes our body to become very lightheaded, which makes us feel like we are not spinning. It’s a very strange and unfortunate side effect of dizziness."
Why arent SSDs and SD cards the same size even though a lot of them can hold the same amount?,"I can answer this! SSDs are flash drives, SD cards are memory cards. SSDs are essentially a hard drive, SD cards are essentially a small amount of memory. They are different in that SSDs are much faster and more reliable than SD cards. There are different types of SD cards, and they have different speeds. SD cards are typically used for small amounts of data and are meant to be used in devices that need a lot of storage, but don't need the fastest speeds. SSDs are used for larger amounts of data and are meant to be used in devices that need fast storage."

How does swallowing upside down work?,"( URL_0 ) Swallowing is the act of moving food into your stomach, and the stomach is a muscular bag that can stretch to hold food. When you swallow, the food moves down the esophagus, which is a tube that connects your throat to your stomach. The esophagus is lined with muscles that contract to push the food down. The muscles are stimulated by signals from your brain. When you eat, you feel hungry, which triggers your brain to send signals to your stomach to get ready to digest food. When you swallow, your brain sends signals to your esophageal muscles to contract. The food moves down the esophagus and into the stomach. The stomach is lined with mucus, which protects the food from acid. The stomach also secretes digestive enzymes and acids to break down the food. The food then moves into the small intestine, where the nutrients are absorbed into your bloodstream."

"Why, when we are falling from a height, is it our first instinct to swing our arms in a circular motion?","y /u/MatthewRose]
> Why, when we are falling from a height, is it our first instinct to swing our arms in a circular motion?

Because, when you are falling, you are moving in a straight line. The only way to change your motion is to apply force in a different direction. You can't apply force in the direction you're falling, so you need to apply force in a different direction, like up. If you do that, you'll start moving in a different direction, like up. If you keep moving in a straight line, you'll keep falling. If you move in a different direction, you'll start rising. This is the same reason why you can't stop falling by flapping your arms. If you do that, you'll just start moving in a different direction, like sideways. You'll still be falling, but you'll be falling sideways instead of straight down. If you want to stop falling, you need to apply force in a different direction, like up. That's why we instinctively move our arms up and down when we're falling.   not a conscious thing, it's just something that happens automatically.   like when you're swimming and you start to tire. Your body instinctively kicks your legs up and down to keep your head above water.  "
Why is peanut butter only available in jars and not wider containers like hummus?,"Peanut butter is a solid, and it needs to be kept cold. It's got a lot of oil in it, and it's a bit sticky. So you need a container that's strong enough to keep it from breaking, and that's not easily damaged. And you need a container that's sealable, so that the peanut butter doesn't spill out when you're opening it. Hummus is made from chickpeas, and it's a bit runny. It doesn't need to be kept cold, and it's not sticky. So you can use a wide container, and you don't need a sealable container. But peanut butter is a bit more complicated. It's got a lot of oil in it, and it's got a lot of solids. The solids are actually the peanuts themselves. And the oil is actually the peanut butter. So you need a container that's strong enough to keep the peanuts from breaking, and that's not easily damaged.

Why do we feel cold when our body is hot during fever?,"The fever is a response to an infection. It is the body's attempt to fight the infection by raising its temperature. When your body is hot, it is because it is producing more heat than it is losing. The body has a thermostat, which is the hypothalamus, which is located in the brain. The hypothalamus is a small part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the body's temperature. The hypothalamus is like the control room of the body's temperature. It is responsible for controlling the temperature of the body by controlling the amount of heat that the body produces and the amount of heat that the body loses. When your body is hot, the hypothalamus is doing its job by producing more heat than it is losing. This makes you feel hot. When you feel hot, it is because your body is producing more heat than it is losing. This is the body's attempt to fight the infection by raising its temperature. When the hypothalamus detects that your body temperature is rising, it will produce more heat to keep your body temperature at a healthy level. This is why you feel hot when your body is hot during fever."
