Why do old games running on new hardware still have technical issues?,"I'm an old game dev. I've seen a lot of this stuff. The short answer is that the hardware is better, but the software is still the same. You can't make a 20 year old game run better on a new computer, because the code is old. It's like trying to make a car run better by replacing the engine with a new one, but the rest of the car is still the same. There are a lot of reasons why code gets old. It's hard to keep up with new technology, and it's hard to keep up with new operating systems. It's also hard to keep up with new hardware. There are a lot of reasons why code gets old. It's hard to keep up with new technology, and it's hard to keep up with new operating systems. It's also hard to keep up with new hardware. Sometimes the hardware is better, sometimes it's worse. It's hard to tell. The old hardware was designed to run a specific set of games. The new hardware is designed to run a wide range of games. The old hardware was designed to run a wide range of games, but the old hardware is not as good at running games as the new hardware is. The old hardware is more limited. The old hardware is slower.   memory.   processing power.  ","The XBox is emulating NES hardware and running the emulation at a set speed. If it ran it at as fast as possible, then it would be several times faster than the original NES game and would be unplayable. I can't speak for Mega Man exactly, but older games tended to run on a cycle locked to the screen refresh which was a fixed 60Hz or 50Hz. There was only one piece of hardware they ran on, so there was no need to adjust for different hardware speeds. In that case, it's probably on purpose - they want to emulate the experience as closely as possible, even including the slowdown and sprite flickering. Some emulators let you turn it off, but it's usually turned on by default. In other cases, like if you're trying to emulate PS2 games on your PC, the game might just run really slow in general. Even though your PC is way more powerful than a PS2, it has to ""translate"" from PS2 language to PC language in realtime, which is much more difficult than running PS2 code on the PS2 itself.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 27.73, 'recall': 34.92, 'fmeasure': 30.91}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.53, 'recall': 3.19, 'fmeasure': 2.82}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.29, 'recall': 17.99, 'fmeasure': 15.93}}"
Why are electrical lines slack between poles?,Because the weight of the wire is enough to pull the pole down. But the wire is not long enough to pull the pole down all the way. The wire is also not strong enough to hold the pole up. So it just sags a bit.   the pole down all the way. Or if the pole was thicker or stronger it would hold the wire up. But it’s not. The reason we have a pole is to hold the wire up. So the wire is slack because the pole is slack. The pole is slack because it’s not strong enough to hold the wire up. The wire is slack because the pole is slack. It’s a bit of a chicken and egg situation. But the main reason is because the wire is not strong enough to hold the pole up.   the pole down all the way.

It’s a bit of a chicken and egg situation. But the main reason is because the wire is not strong enough to hold the pole up.  ,"Because if they were pulled taut, then a strong wind could bend the poles away from each other and snap the lines, loosing high energy power lines onto the ground below which can be extremely dangerous. A little bit of slack is just fine. There are a few reasons. First, they're metal. Metals expand and contract with heat--if there was no slack, they'd possibly break under extreme temperature changes. Second, birds and debris sometimes land on them. You need them to be able to take some weight, which means they can't be stretched too tight. The lines have mass. So there is something that needs to hold them up. Any force is composed of a horizontal and a vertical force. And a line under tension have a force following the line. So in order to keep the line up you need a certain force up on each pole in addition to the horizontal force. You could increase the horizontal force which would make the line more straight but it would still have some slack in them. You can not get rid of it. The amount of slack in a power line is a compromise between the force that can be applied to the lines before they or the poles snap in wind and how tight the lines have to be to not hit each other or the ground.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 30.14, 'recall': 28.45, 'fmeasure': 29.27}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.75, 'recall': 2.6, 'fmeasure': 2.67}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.72, 'recall': 17.67, 'fmeasure': 18.18}}"
"It's been 12 years since the tallest roller coaster was built. Is there a limit to roller coaster heights, or what is the reason why there hasn't been more competition?","It's not a limit of the roller coaster, it's a limit of the people who can fit on it. The ride has to be able to slow down and stop in a reasonable amount of time, and if the ride is too long then it will take too long to slow down. Roller coasters have a ""g-force"" limit, meaning that the riders can't be subjected to more than 4.5g's of acceleration. This means that the roller coaster has to be designed to be able to slow down quickly enough to avoid exceeding this limit. There are limits to the height of the roller coaster, but it's not a limit of the technology. The reason why there hasn't been more competition is that it's expensive to build a roller coaster. The cost of building a roller coaster is on the order of $10 million or more. It's a very expensive investment for a theme park to make.","It's really about cost and safety. Look at the example of Drachen Fire coaster in Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, Virginia. It was a fast steel coaster that ran from 1992-1998. It has a 150 foot drop, reached 60 mph, and had a special double bend that produced a split-second of zero-gravity effect. The problem was that the ride was very rough and many injuries ensued. Shortly after opening they told people to remove earrings because of the number of cases of them being ripped out of ears as a result of the ride. Busch Gardens had to disassemble Drachen Fire in 1998 at a considerable loss. It's not just physics, but safety that matters as well. There's no limit in principle to the height a coaster can be built. Arrow's proposed [fishhook coaster]( URL_1 ) would have been 750ft high if it had ever been built. The [Polercoaster]( URL_0 ) currently proposed to be built in Florida would be over 500ft high. The primary reason why the height record hasn't been broken since 2005 is economic. Large coasters are very expensive to build, record breaking ones even more so. There aren't that many parks large enough that they can justify the cost. It's probably twofold: (1) The economy sucks. Theme parks are a bit of a luxury good - > people are less inclined to pour money in to them during hard times. (2) I'm pretty sure that whilst not technically impossible to build bigger rollercoasters, the cost gets exponentially higher as you get bigger. Would not at all be surprised if a rollercoaster 20% taller than the biggest one right now is like 100% more expensive to build.

What exactly IS a belt drive motor?,"A belt drive motor is a motor that uses a belt to transfer power to a shaft. This is in contrast to a gearbox, where power is transferred through gears. This is important because the speed of a motor is determined by the number of turns in the motor, which means that the speed is the same regardless of the load on the motor. In a gearbox, the speed of the motor is determined by the number of turns in the gears, and the load on the motor is transferred to the gears, which can cause the motor to slow down. Belt drives are used in a lot of applications, including power tools, conveyor belts, and other machinery. They are used when a motor needs to be connected to a shaft, but the motor and shaft are far apart, and it's not practical to use a gearbox.","A motor with a pulley and a belt which drives another pulley. The alternative is direct drive. That can include drive via gearing, shaft, friction wheel, or other. It's not a thing. The motor drives a belt, which drives what you want to move.

"What is this ""Split Bolt"" for and why is it 15 thousand dollars?","...it's an old-fashioned socket wrench with a long handle. It's called a ""split bolt"" because the bolt head has a split in it. The socket fits over the bolt and the handle of the socket wrench is long enough that the user can turn the socket from a distance, but the bolt head is split so that when the socket is turned, the bolt head splits and the bolt is removed.","Everybody else is right as to what it's for, maybe I can help with the price. Sometimes, a company encounters a situation where they need exactly this very component, as soon as humanly possible, or else they stand to lose a ton of money. So occasionally you can find vendors listing fasteners for ludicrous prices on the off chance that happens. If they have the last one, you buy it. Source: I'm an aircraft engineer that has encouraged hundreds of thousands of dollars of spending on ridiculously overpriced items to get a plane ungrounded. They are just industrial wire connectors and I can not understand those prices. They're usually like a couple dollars a piece I'm not an expert, but I found items similar to these listed at the Grainger site. They are for splicing large wires together.

What are the benefits of a smaller processor nm? like from 32nm to 14nm to 10nm?,"The smaller the transistors are, the more of them can be put on the chip, and the more complex the chip can be. This means that a smaller processor can do more. Also, smaller transistors are faster, because they can switch on and off faster. In addition, the smaller transistors are, the less power they consume. This means that a smaller processor will use less power, and thus produce less heat.","Were able to achieve a smaller size only due to the finer resolution that we can make the individual pathways on the silicon that makes up the CPU. The smaller size means that electrons have to travel less distance and use shed less power in resistance to do the same work. None of the other replies really get to the heart of the matter. The main reason why smaller feature size is better is because a guy named Dennard discovered that the smaller features on a processor, the faster the clock speed can be. This known as Dennard scaling: URL_0 This often confused with Moore's Law, which states that transistor density doubles every 18 months or so. While they are different laws, they are obviously related, since Moore's Law predicts the rate at which features will shrink, and Dennard says that smaller features are faster. Another reason for smaller features is that improves the yield of silicon wafers used to make processors, and therefore reduces the cost of making processors. For example, every silicon wafer will probably have a few defects in it. If a processor was so large that it used a whole silicon wafer, it would be difficult to ever make a processor without defects. Now if you can fit two processors on a single wafer, the odds of one of those processors not having a defect just went up. Now take this example to the extreme. Say you have a wafer with 3 defects on it, but you can fit 100 processors on it, because they're so small. You now have made 97 usable processors from a single silicon wafer, increasing your yield, which decreases your cost per processor. Now that you have increased your yield and reduced costs so that you can sell enough processors to make a profit, you can continue to reduce feature size and use that to add more features to your processor ( like caches, vector registers and additional floating point units) while keeping the processor size constant, which should keep yield constant. The nm number is a measure of how small they can make the components on the chip. Smaller numbers mean that the transistors and other components are smaller. This in turn means that more can be packed into a given area, or making a chip with a given number of transistors will be smaller. This is one of the main benefits. If we suppose that the processors in typical computers have up to 10 cm^2 of space, then smaller components (smaller nm) means that more cores can be put into that space or cores with more additional circuitry. That additional circuitry can come in real handy. For example, being able work with more floating point numbers (binary equivalent of real numbers with a decimal point) in parallel at once in math operations. Or being able to calculate common hash functions and cryptographic functions in hardware instead of software resulting in a massive speedup for anything using them (say, browsing a website using TLS/SSL). Or making various processor instructions more efficient (taking less clock cycles to compute). There are a few downsides. As the components get smaller, the insulation between the wires and the parts of the electronic components gets thinner. As the insulation gets thinner, it leaks more electricity which wastes power and generates heat. The bad news is that at these sizes, reducing the thickness of the insulation by a factor of two doesn't double the leakage. It increases a lot more than double. The reason for this is that at these scales, quantum tunnelling of electrons through the insulation starts to become important and the rate of that increases very steeply as the insulation gets thinner.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 87.32, 'recall': 9.92, 'fmeasure': 17.82}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 27.14, 'recall': 3.04, 'fmeasure': 5.48}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 47.89, 'recall': 5.44, 'fmeasure': 9.77}}"
Nikola Tesla's plan for wireless electricity,"transmission. Might be a little off, but I'm pretty sure that's what he was going for. 1. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer. It's a transformer that has a resonant frequency. This means that it's designed to resonate at a certain frequency. When you connect a load to the transformer, the load will start to resonate at the same frequency. 2. The Tesla Coil is designed to resonate at a frequency of 100 kHz. 3. 100 kHz is a frequency that's close to the frequency of the Earth's electromagnetic field. 4. The Earth's electromagnetic field is generated by the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind. 5. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the interaction between the Earth's core and the solar wind. 6. The solar wind is generated by the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field. 7. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the interaction between the Earth's core and the solar wind. 8. The Earth's core is made up of iron and nickel. 9. The Earth's core is surrounded by a layer of molten iron. 10. The Earth's core is surrounded by a layer of molten nickel.","To make current (flowing electrons) in a wire, you need a magnetic field moving across that wire (you can also have the field stay pit, and move the wire, relative motion is the key). Magnetic field do not travel very well though. They dissapate very quickly the further you go. An electromagnetic wave, on the other hand, will travel much further. The electric part of the wave reinforces the magnetic, and vice versa. The key problem, is that the power of the wave drops off with distance. Given a transmitter of a fixed amount of power, say 100 watts, at 1 meter from the transmitter, that 100 watts is divided across a sphere that has a surface area of ( 4 * pi * r^2 ) call it 12 square meters. At 2 meters you have 48 square meters to divide the 100 watts. At 3 you have almost 120 square meters of surface are to 'fill' with the same amount of power output. Tesla thought you could overcome this drop off by using resonance. If the field vibrated at the same frequency as the earth/atmosphere system, the transmission efficiency would be greatly enhanced. As far as anyone is aware, he was not able to make this work on a large scale. People here keep referencing the tesla coil as his method of wireless power transfer. While partly true that was not his complete idea for low loss wireless power transmission across large distances. Most Tesla's ideas involved constructive resonance through a medium. Tesla's idea was to use the earth and atmosphere as a medium. He believed that he could use the earth itself as a conductor by taking advantage of resonant frequencies and using the atmosphere itself as to complete the circuit. Essentially people would put a wire into the ground and a second ""antenna"" up into the air and they could power their home without wires connecting to a grid from his power station towers. Wikipedia has a nice, imho, simple [eli5 explaination]( URL_0 ) I will leave here: ""The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allowing alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance it at any point on Earth with very little power loss.[116][117][118] His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would ""break the air stratum down"", eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit.[119][120] Tesla would go on the next year to propose a ""World Wireless System"" that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide[121][122] and attempted in 1901 to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called the Wardenclyffe Tower, at Shoreham, New York. By 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed."" Several of the explanations here are wrong. Beware! :) As Tesla kept saying and saying, *it wasn't radio. It had nothing to do with radio. The inverse-square law did not apply, because radio waves weren't being sent from an antenna.* He wasn't using his giant Tesla coil in radio-transmitter mode. He wasn't broadcasting his waves into outer space like Marconi did. Anyone insisting differently, they're simply wrong, and remain clueless about Tesla's actual plans. But, they're wrong for good reason. It's because Tesla kept secrets. Today we know quite a bit because Tesla did give many details in a private 1916 legal deposition (Marconi radio court case,) but that wasn't published until 75 years later. Much else being said about Tesla's wireless system was either uninformed speculation, or was taking Tesla's furtive and semi-misleading comments about secret inventions as being complete explanations. Before 1992 you had to go to the Tesla Museum if you wanted to know the truth. Instead, most authors just made s & 't up about Tesla. Or, they lifted their information from earlier books which made s & 't up about Tesla. Unfortunately, all this wrong speculation ended up in books. And if books clearly state Tesla's wireless plan, it must be true? And it's even more true when many books say the same thing? Nope. That's pure BS. It's ""game of telephone"" where books repeat earlier books with distortion, and the info in earlier books came from even earlier ones. And the original info was speculation to begin with! Instead, read original Tesla docs with Tesla's actual statements (which remained inside the Beograd Tesla Museum until finally published by Leland Anderson 1992 ""[Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy...]( URL_0 )"" --- Ok ok, *WHAT WAS TESLA'S PLAN?* It was very simple: make a conductive path all the way up to the top of the sky, to the conductive ionosphere layer. Then power the ionosphere with a fifty million volts power supply, as if the entire sky was one giant plate of a capacitor. The ground serves as the other plate. The sky-plasma was his power-line, with the Earth being the return conductor. Giant tesla-coils with 100 megavolts on the upper terminal would create the vertical ""plasma tower"" to conduct current to the sky itself. They'd also supply power to every Tesla-type power-receiver on Earth. Very cool idea: we're in the gap of Tesla's giant capacitor, the size of Earth's atmosphere. It's as if all of human society was placed inside a microwave oven operating at low frequency. Hold up a fluorescent tube, and it glows wirelessly, anywhere on Earth. (Well, his planned power level wasn't high enough for that. Tube-lamps would need a few yards of vertical antenna and a small coil before it would glow wirelessly.) One engineering paper in the 1980s estimated that such a system would consume a millon watts entirely in wasted energy, but these losses would be constant. That means 10 megawatt system would be 90% efficient, while a 100MW system would be 99% efficient. Note that large power grids tend to be under 70% efficient < edit, wrong might be more like 94% > Only one problem. HOW THE EFF DOES SOMEONE MAKE CONNECTION TO THE IONOSPHERE? Carbon-fiber space-elevators?!!! Tesla said he would ""break down the atmosphere"" between his tower-electrode and the conductive layers far above. So, a lightning bolt. Only needs to be 30KM tall. Roughly. So, all the Tesla-skeptics were never able to properly scoff at his wireless-power system. Tesla had them all gnashing and frothing about inverse-square falloff and near-zero efficiency, when his system actually wasn't using radio waves at all. It was an invisible power line, an odd type of beamed-power using plasma. They should have been scoffing about Tesla's ability to create the 30KM vertical spark needed for his system to work. Well, spark, or a glow-discharge. * [Artist conception of Tesla's system in operation]( URL_1 ), from 2001 Serbian-language book from the Tesla Museum. * [Tesla's lab-scale protoype of Wireless Power xmission]( URL_0 #Section_7), build for Patent model From the above diagram with the glass tube, we see that Tesla's system was based on conducted currents in glowing air, not on radio waves. Those current paths would glow at night. It was only ""wireless"" in the way that neon signs are ""filament-less."" In modern words, Tesla was going to use tens of kilometers of glowing plasma as his power grid. Interesting trivia: when Tesla was discussing this in an interview, the reporter said why not just guide your lightning discharge up to the sky using ultraviolet spotlights. Tesla changed the subject! Decades later Tesla said that the UV spotlights placed atop Tesla Coils were his first goal, but he then tested it and found that the discharge-length remained far too short. He abandoned the carbon-arc searchlights, and instead discovered another method which he claimed was successful, and he'd fully tested it on his giant coils at Colorado Springs. A side-effect would be to make the entire sky above the transmitter glow like a vast Aurora. He never said what this method was. Later he changed his mind about making it public, because he said it had major weapons possibilities. It could ""render uninhabitable"" any selected spot on Earth. ""It would be like giving a knife to an infant."" Whatever was the trick was, or, whichever way Tesla was fooling himself, he took the secret to his grave. Therefore, don't laugh about Tesla's system being ""too inefficient,"" or because ""Tesla didn't even know about inverse-square law."" That's just ignorant. Instead, laugh at Tesla for suggesting that he'd actually excited the Earth's entire ionosphere using a vertical gas-breakdown path many tens of KM tall ...late at night out in Colorado, so nobody would see the sky-glow aurora effects it created. *I saw that I would be able to transmit power provided I could construct a certain apparatus -- and I have, as I will show you later. I have constructed and patented a form of apparatus which, with a moderate elevation of a few hundred feet, can break the air stratum down. You will then see something like an aurora borealis across the sky, and the energy will go to the distant place. ...I came to the conviction that it would be ultimately possible, without any elevated antenna --- with very small elevation --- to break down the upper stratum of the air and transmit the current by conduction.* -N. Tesla 1916 Well, one thing's certain. Tesla was exactly right in insisting that, it wasn't radio. It wasn't practical, sorry to say. A Tesla coil is essentially a huge radio transmitter, with no content, typically in the 2-100KHz range but it's unclear what frequency he was planning to use (plans may never have been settled to that level of detail). A normal radio receiver gets tuned to match the frequency of the radio transmitter and collect as much power as possible, but still, the signal is TINY (not enough to light an LED) and all the power to drive the speakers comes from the receiver's battery driving an amp. Even though the radio transmitter is tens of thousands of watts. Tesla really didn't have anything new in that regard, but fantasized about impossibly huge radio transmitters and bigger receiver antennae. There are many aspects which don't make sense here: 1. The radio transmitter would have to be fantastically huge for anyone to receive a useful amount of power, even right next to it. It would be very inefficient and power ain't free. 2. Strong RF flux is actually known to be *dangerous* to people and the environment. OSHA sets a limit of 10 mW/cm^2. The power levels needed to light a lightbulb are comically above that. 3. It would not just be received by the intended antenna, it would be picked up in the wires of any circuitry not shielded in a metal box. It would cause massive interference. 4. You could receive more power with less RF flux, but the antenna must be huge. If you have an antenna spread out across an acre to receive a few watts from a transmitter 1/2 mile away at 0.0001% efficiency, why wouldn't you just run a wire to the power source? You may have heard the claim ""a major breakthrough in 1899 at Colorado Springs by transmitting 100 million volts of high-frequency electric power wirelessly over a distance of 26 miles at which he lit up a bank of 200 light bulbs and ran one electric motor!"" Also listed as 50W bulbs, 10kW. That ""fact"" showed up in a 1944 biography of Tesla written by John O'Neill. There is NO source for the claim, in fact O'Neill was NOT a proper historian and said a lot of shit which doesn't correlate with history. Tesla took meticulous notes at Colorado Springs and he never documented anything like that. No one other than O'Neill said anything like this. Some people think ""well Tesla was being too secretive to record it, because it might be stolen"" but that's nothing like Tesla. Tesla was desperate for funding and into *grossly inflating* his claims. No one could ""steal"" his work, he was too far ""out there"" for others to even try to replicate. One theory someone came up with: ""It is interesting to note the 1909 American Encyclopedia cites the first commercial transmission of AC on November 17, 1896 was from Niagara Falls to Buffalo, N.Y., a distance of 26 miles. Could this have been the historical event after which the questionable 26 mile Colorado Springs figure was derived?"" Plausible, IMHO. O'Neill was a kind of a confused guy. Imagine you are on a trampoline. Around the edge, you put marbles. In the center, you drop a bowling ball. When it hits the tarp, the bowling ball makes all the marbles on the outside edges move. If you could dribble the bowling ball, or bounce it just right, you could get the outside marbles to move repeatedly. The bowling ball is the tower, and the marbles are receivers. Basically tesla ""bounced"" energy in that tower, and the marbes felt it and were affected by it at a distance. The problem is that tesla wanted to make the trampoline *really* big, so big that the marbles would be too far away from the bowling ball to feel it. *** I stand corrected- I'm talking more about a tesla coil system here, where it appears the question was about his atmospheric power system. Refer to /u/wbeaty answer as I think that is more accurate. My answer applies more to wireless power via electromagnetic waves, wheareas his is more about making the sky and earth into a giant conductive sandwich. To my knowledge the Wycliffe tower was intended to be a tesla cool type system, but I do not know for sure. A Tesla coil when Tesla was building them, wasn't about generating lightning, the lightning was an unwanted side effect of his transmitting coil. A Tesla coil is like a swing, but with electromagnetic fields instead of mass, gravity and a pendulum. Energy is pumped into the coil at its resonant frequency, and like a swing set, swings further and further as you add energy at its resonant frequency. These swings of the electromagnetic energy sends out electromagnetic waves through the air. Tesla coils are very efficient at generating electromagnetic waves. Back in Tesla's day, electricity in the home was all about lighting. There weren't many home appliances and industry mainly still used diesel, steam or water for powering their machinery. With fluorescent lighting, energy put into the tube causes it to emit uv radiation. That radiation hits the white phosphorus coating in the inside of the tube and is absorbed and re-emitted as visible light. In the electromagnetic field given off by a Tesla coil, the tube will also give off light. Tesla wanted to build absurdly large Tesla coils to light up fluorescent tubes at huge distances instead of running wires from the generating station to homes. Tesla believed that a spherical conductor (i.e. The Earth), can support *surface waves*. They look a little [like this]( URL_0 ). They hug around the outer surface of a conductor, and in the case of the Earth would continually diffract around it. Surface waves (also called creeping waves, ground waves, Sommerfield-Zenneck waves) do exist. He thought he could transfer power around the Earth using these waves - exciting them using his Tesla coil. It would create a standing wave around the Earth -the waves would be emitted from his transmitter, go around the Earth, converge at the anti-pode, and then come back. If you know anything about standing waves, they are caused by a transmitted and reflected wave, which is what would happen here. Imagine a guitar, the strings are the wardencliff tower and the guitar body is the earth. When the string is played it resonates within the body. The earth would resonate the power through the ground so it could be extracted at a distant location. In one way, radio transmission is a form of wireless power; after all, a crystal radio is powered purely by radio waves, without external amplification. Of course, by the time it reaches you, the signal is very weak indeed. Signals from Wardenclyffe going through the ground would also experience huge losses. Tesla also misunderstood the properties of electromagnetic waves. Make air electric so all electric things are powered by the air (hope this was a good ELI5, it seems many explanations tend to be ELI have a reasonable background in the topic and am around 20 and might not help the person for what they want) Today we know electricty is caused by the sharing of electrons between a conductive material (copper wire). Tesla on the other hand thought that electricty came from an invisible 'Ether' in which electrons are a free floating entity in space not attached to any atoms. He thought that by pumping electricity into the ground via the Wardenclyffe tower he would be able to send energy all over the world. Turns out he was just connecting to the largest ground system known to man and disscharging all of his electricity into the earth. His Tesla coil does work for sending electrical energy wirlessly but it is not usefull for our needs. Imagine connecting a computer to WiFi and having the option to plug in an ethernet cable. In the simplest terms, electricity moving through a wire creates a magnetic field around it. If you wrap the wire around into a coil, that field gets stronger. (this is the basic principal upon which electromagnets and electric motors operate) Similarly, the opposite is true as well. If you introduce a magnetic field to some wire, it will induce electrical current in the wire. (technically the change in magnetic field, but that's not super important for an ELI5 explanation) This effect is stronger with more ""coils"" of the wire. (this is the basic principal upon which generators operate) So, to transfer power wirelessly, you just send a high frequency (meaning many times per second) alternating current (means polarity switches back and forth from positive to negative over and over) through a coil of wire, and put another coil close enough to be in reach of that first coil's magnetic field, and boom, you have transferred power wirelessly. Tesla had the idea of scaling this principal up to a HUGE scale. I'm five days late to this question, and there are already a few good answers, so I assume no one will see this, but a big part of the complication in understanding Tesla's wireless power system comes from the fact that his wireless power system combined two very different systems. The first was a wireless power transmission system that used the earth as a resonator for ELF-VLF 'reactive' 'quasi-superconducting' energy transmission (for up to ~30 kHz), and the second part was a solar wind energy harvesting system. These systems were completely independent inventions, but he intended to combine both ideas in his global tower system. [Wardenclyffe]( URL_13 ) was supposed to be only the first of many such towers. The first system was apparently his single-wire power system but using the layer of water (groundwater, lakes and oceans) as the resonator instead of a transmission line. The solar wind energy harvesting system was later developed in a much more limited local form using metal balloons instead of towers by Estonian inventor Hermann Plauson of the Fischer-Tropsch Otto Traun Research Corporation. Plauson is apparently better known as the inventor of the colloidal mill for making asphalt. Plauson put a lot of effort into developing this atmospheric energy tech for many years before patenting it in 1921 ([US Pat. No. 1,540,998]( URL_12 )). People found some things Tesla said about the combined wireless system impossible like especially how much power he said was available. In 1904, Tesla said he could produce 6 million households of energy from Wardenclyffe consuming only 6 households of energy—produce a 7.5 GW wave from only 7.5 KW input. That must have sounded especially unbelievable to people who were not yet even aware that the solar wind exists. Disbelief in that incredible claim might have contributed to the rumor that he had lost his mind. If it is possible to harness solar wind like Tesla said, we aren't aware of how to do it yet. But no one seems to have investigated Plauson's research lately or this aspect of Tesla's research. Plauson claimed to harness tens to hundreds of KW using only tethered metal balloons. In his patent Plauson said the energy came from the atmosphere, which might be possible, but it seems more likely it would have been harnessing solar wind energy as it enters the atmosphere if only because extracting energy from the atmosphere like that seems more impossible.

First time I've ever had a real answer when asking anyone. A lot of people I have asked believe that the government and/ or JP Morgan are the reason we don't use this energy. Because they can't make a profit off of it I guess. He wanted to make a low frequency, high power, isotropic antenna. Then shoot a low frequency, high power, continuous, radio wave from it. This wave would travel around the world. It would have so much power that any radio antenna could pick up enough energy to power appliances. How does tesla [the car company] use his inventions in their cars? Adding on: Wireless electricity already exists in the form of conductive wireless charging, which is most often seen in phones as inductive wireless charging. From the Wikipedia page: > the use of an induction coil which produces an electromagnetic field via a charging station where energy is transferred to an electronic device which is also equipped with a corresponding induction coil. It's essentially charging the device via electromagnetism. Standard charging methods rely on the conventional (and far more efficient) application of electricity: in a closed circuit, with electrons travelling in a loop from the negative terminal to the positive.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 83.26, 'recall': 4.49, 'fmeasure': 8.52}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 34.58, 'recall': 1.86, 'fmeasure': 3.52}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 48.37, 'recall': 2.61, 'fmeasure': 4.95}}"

How do DSLR cameras work?,"DSLRs are a type of camera called a reflex camera. They use a mirror and prism system to allow the photographer to see exactly what the camera is seeing. The mirror is raised and lowered in the camera by a motor to switch between the two modes. In the viewfinder mode, the mirror is raised and the light from the lens is reflected into the viewfinder, allowing the photographer to see exactly what they are taking a picture of. In the live view mode, the mirror is lowered and the light is sent directly to the sensor, allowing the photographer to see exactly what the camera is taking a picture of on the rear LCD screen.","SLR as a term is pretty well defined - it stands for ""Single-Lens Reflex"". Forget digital for a moment - remember normal point and shoot film cameras? You'd have a small viewfinder at the top, which you'd look through. Well, the problem with those is that you're not quite seeing the same as the camera lens sees - a bit like looking through a gun sight. They'll be close, and at a certain distance it'll be the same, but you're ultimately looking through a different window. In addition, this also means you can't easily use adjustable lenses because you'd simply have to guess the focus and zoom. Well, SLR's solved that problem by having a mirror which moves. When you're not taking a photo the mirror is positioned so that the viewfinder is looking directly through the lens. In addition to being able to accurately compose the photo, this also means you can use adjustable lenses because you can physically see whether it's in focus or not. When you press the button, the mirror moves and exposes the film to exactly the same light you've been looking at. DSLR is simply the digital equivalent. The mirror is still there, but instead of film you have a digital sensor. You press the shutter, the mirror moves, and the sensor can now ""see"" through the lens. In day to day life, however, DSLR is somewhat synonymous with the idea of a higher quality camera. They generally come with additional features, better resolutions, better software and so on. But, strictly speaking, to be a DSLR they simply need that mirror system. Slow mo guys did a good video on the internal mechanism URL_0 DSLR are the digital equivalent of SLR. Instead of a film sensor it uses a digital sensor ( a lot larger than other point and shoot camera). SLR or Single-Lens Reflex are a type of camera that use a shutter and a mirror. the shutter is highly configurable in its speed and opening time. the mirror is there to divert the image from the film/sensor to the view-sight. The shutter enable to configure the amount of light going to the sensor to produce the picture. Basically, when you press the button on a DSLR , 3 things are happening. First , the mirror gets out of the way. secondly, the shutter is opening. Third, the sensor capture the light coming in from the lens, then a processor take this information and save it to a memory card in a file that can be easily open and edited in a photo editor program.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 68.97, 'recall': 18.06, 'fmeasure': 28.62}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 20.87, 'recall': 5.43, 'fmeasure': 8.62}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.66, 'recall': 10.38, 'fmeasure': 16.46}}"
Why is it so hard to completely prevent clipping of 3D models in video games?,"It's not impossible to prevent clipping. You just need to use a more efficient algorithm to generate the 3D models. There are a couple of ways to do this. One way is to use a technique called ""level of detail"" where you only generate the level of detail that's visible in the game. This means you can use a much simpler algorithm to generate the models and it will be fast enough to be used in the game. The other way is to use a technique called ""procedural generation"" where the models are generated on the fly based on the distance from the camera. This means that the models are never fully generated and the game can use a much simpler algorithm to generate the models. This is the technique used in most games nowadays. This is because it's much faster and more efficient. It also allows for much more flexibility in terms of the models that can be used.   old days, models were generated using a very simple algorithm that only allowed for a few shapes.   old days, models were generated using a very simple algorithm that only allowed for a few shapes.   old days, models were generated using a very simple algorithm that only allowed for a few shapes.   old days, models were generated using a very simple algorithm that only allowed for a few shapes.   old days, models were generated using a very simple algorithm that only allowed for a few shapes.  ","It comes down to hitboxes. These are imaginary cubes drawn around ""things"" in games. The more detailed the hitboxes are, the more computations need to be done to determine if things collide. Lets say you have a minecraft dude. His hitboxes are simple because he's already a few cubes. Its easy to do the math to determine when one cube hits or intersects or runs into another cube. Or if I shoot your minecraft dude with a gun, all I have to do is aim within the imaginary hotbox cubes that surround your dude. Pretty simple. But as the 3d models of things (your Halo dude, that explody barrel, the monster) get more complex, the less ideal a few cube hitbox is going to be. no, you want the hitbox for your character to match the geometry of your character. If your Halo dude had a simple single hitbox cube, if you got a rocket anywhere in that imaginary cube it would count as a hit. But thats bullcrap because you totally jumped that rocket, it went _between_ your dude's legs. So now, to be more accurate the hitbox model that represents where your dude ""is"" has to be made up of a bunch of smaller geometric shapes. Maybe, the hitbox model of your dude is almost as complex as the visualization model of your dude. But as you add complexity to that model, all the math to calculate whether bullets, rockets, explody things collided or hit your dude, get a lot more complex. And complexity is fine, but there's only so much processing power available, given your game client and the server have to calculate not only whether your dude got hit by that grenade blast, but the other 63 dudes on the server. Its a similar thing to the calculations on how your dude is affected by the geometry of other things. Your guy is leaning up against a wall? If the collision/hitbox model of your guy was really detailed, and the geometry of your dude's model was programmed to do it, you could model individual limbs (nay, in some games with ragdoll physics, individual bones) and how they interact with a wall, a crate, riding that horse... but again, complexity and ""realism"" brings computations. So the guys who write game engines have to strike a balance between ""well maybe the wizard's flowing robes sometimes clip into the wall he's standing next to, but at least a 64 person battle has a decent frame rate"" vs. ""we have simulated character models down to individual chest hairs. But you can only get 2 frames per second."" Vfx student here. From what I know, In order to do that would essentially require creating everything as physics objects or create individual hit boxes for each element in the game. Not easy and can really place a burden on your computer. I am sure there is someone more experienced in this topic, but depending on how detailed the models or elements in the game are, it's just easier to allow clipping in a few of the elements rather than miss a release date or spend money trying to correct the problem.

Whats the difference between torque and horsepower?,"Torque is a measure of force, and horsepower is a measure of energy. The more torque you have, the more energy you can generate. Horsepower is a measure of how much power an engine is capable of producing. Torque is a measure of the rotational force an engine can produce. They are not the same thing, but they are related. Torque is a measure of rotational force. Horsepower is a measure of power, or the rate at which work is done.","Torque is the real, measurable force applied by the wheels to the road. (It's generated by the engine, then multiplied by the gearbox, final drive, and wheels.) Because it's applied by a circular wheel, it's measured in a combined unit of weight and length - pound-feet or newton-meters. A torque of one newton-meter applied to the road is equivalent to the force exerted on the wheel's hub by a weight of one newton, suspended horizontally from a stick that's one meter long and attached to the hub at the other end. Horsepower is not a real measurable force - it is a mathematical construct that represents the engine's ability to accomplish work over time. The work is moving a certain weight (the car) across a certain distance over a certain time. You'll notice that compared to torque, time is now added. So if the weight of the car is the same, and the distance it's traveling is the same (let's say, a quarter mile), then to do the work over a shorter period of time - get there faster - you need to use up more horsepower. Because there is a direct mechanical relationship between the engine's revs and the wheel revs, and therefore the car's actual speed, horsepower is calculated as torque multiplied by revs, and divided by a specific coefficient to account for the difference in units. Note: this is about engine torque, measured at the crankshaft. The torque at the wheels is a much larger figure, multiplied by the gearbox, final drive, and wheel circumference. (A horsepower is around 745 watts, because James Watt calculated this as the power of a typical mining horse and used it for marketing, to show how many horses his engine could replace. In the standard system, one watt is the amount of work/energy that raises a weight of one newton to a height of one meter in one second.) The super basic, non-mathematical answer: Torque is how much work you can do. Horsepower is how fast you can do that work. Think of a semi tractor-trailer next to a souped up Honda. Both engines could make the same number of horsepower, but the semi tractors engine makes a LOT more torque. The semi tractor can do a lot more work, but it takes longer to do it.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 67.9, 'recall': 13.78, 'fmeasure': 22.92}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.5, 'recall': 3.52, 'fmeasure': 5.86}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 40.74, 'recall': 8.27, 'fmeasure': 13.75}}"

In both cases your goal is to make liquid water colder, but the reasons for wanting colder liquid water are different. In the case of the ice cream maker, there's always at least a thin layer of liquid between the cream container and the solid ice, so colder liquid water means more heat transfers out of the ice cream and into the liquid water (so the ice cream freezes fast enough to freeze the air bubbles into the mix which is why ice cream has such great texture). In the case of the sidewalks, colder liquid water means more ice melts and flows off the sidewalk and melting continues at lower temperatures, reducing the slipping hazard. TL;DR - Salt doesn't make ice colder. What you're going for in both cases is a state change - you want liquid water, not solid water (ice) - without having to compromise the temperature. Unless you have some continuous source of coolant (like my buddies at work that used to make iced cream with Liquid Nitrogen, lol) the ice you have is all the coolant you'll get, so you'll want to freeze the iced cream quickly before the elements warm the coolant (ice/water) beyond usefulness. In order to best transfer the heat away from the ingredients into the ice, you want the *highest possible surface area* of the spinning aluminum container to contact the coolant. Ice cubes aren't that great, crushed ice or party ice is better (smaller chunks), but ultimately liquid is best. You could use glycol or something, but the most available and safest liquid is water. If you want to get water cold enough to freeze the iced cream without freezing into a solid block itself, you have to add salt to lower the freezing point. Fun fact, ice rinks use a salt water (brine) which run through pipes in the concrete beneath the ice surface in order to maintain the temperature at around 19 degrees Fahrenheit. Salt does the same think to ice on sidewalks, except the motivation there is that you just don't want solid water (ice) around. Liquid water will flow away and reduce the hazard/obstacle. These are both the same reason! It's a really good question. Salt makes the freezing point of water lower. That means when you throw it on ice, it tends to melt the ice. Even in the Ice Cream machine. What happens is the solid = > liquid process (melting) requires a small amount of energy (the heat of fusion) even if the temperature stays the same. In the sidewalk case, the large heat capacity of the sidewalk, driveway, Earth under the ice, ... gives up this heat without changing temperature. In the Ice Cream machine case, the ice is insulated from a large source of heat (by the ice cream machine's bucket). This means there is no good source of heat and the heat of fusion much come from the ice and the ice cream inside the can. The ice melts faster, even though it is driving the temperature down from the melting poinf of plain ice to the melting point of ice in salt water. Salt lowers the freezing point of water. In the case of the streets, it means that the water will remain liquid at lower temperatures. In the case of the ice cream, it makes the ice slurry colder without freezing solid. Salt lowers the melting point of water. As a result of this, some of it melts. Something people don't often consider about the act of melting ice is that it takes energy. To change ice at 0C into water at 0C, you need to add about 333Kj/Kg of water, which is quite a bit. This energy has to come from somewhere, and since everywhere is cold, somewhere has to get colder. This means both the water that's formed and the remaining ice cool off to make up for the difference in energy, and because converting a kilo of ice to water takes about the same amount of energy as heating that water from 0C to 80C, the temperature drop is quite steep for a given amount of water formed. This is also why the salted ice cube challenge is stupid. You're pressing ~-20C water up against your skin, frostbite is fast at that temperature with that much thermal conductivity. There is a lot of bad info here. Liquid/solid is irrelevant, but what is relevant is that phase change from solid to liquid is endothermic, meaning it requires energy to occur. When you salt the ice, the phase change from ice to water robs the cream of its energy, making it colder and, hopefully, triggering a phase change in the unsalted water in the ice cream mix, from liquid to solid. So as the salt melts the ice, the transfer of energy causes the custard to freeze. If you had an outer bowl and an inner bowl, put ice into the inner bowl and poured molten metal into the outer bowl, you would expect the water to boil as energy goes from the cooling metal and into the ice. As the metal hardens, the ice melts and may evaporate. This is easy to grasp and is the exact same concept but instead of a phase change that is exothermic (molten metal loses energy as it cools and hardens) you have a phase change that is endothermic (salt melting ice from solid to liquid). The process simply works in reverse. Does that make sense? There are a few factors to it, but some of them are material, temperature difference, and surface area. Thermal energy is always trying to balance out. If something has been in a room for a long time, it is going to be about the same temperature as the air and surface it is sitting on. Metal, however, feels colder than wood, even if both the metal and wood are the same temperature. This is because different materials transfer thermal energy at different rates and THAT is what you feel when you touch things, not the actual temperature. Metal is more conductive of heat, so you lose more heat from your hand to metal than from hand to wood. Water it's self isn't too great, which is why it take so long for it to boil, but the one thing it has over ice is surface area. The larger the surface area of a material, the more of that material is able to directly transfer energy from a heat source into it's self, so while ice may be colder, water can conform to the surface of whatever it is in contact to, due to it being a fluid, and is able to take heat from the soon to be ice cream faster than ice, despite ice having a larger difference in temperature than water compared to the ice cream. Ideally, you would want a liquid as cold as ice so that it can conform to the surface of the ice cream AND transfer the heat better, because the third factor here, temperature difference, matters quite a bit too. With a larger difference in temperature between two materials, you get a larger transfer of energy between them. salty water is nifty because salty water remains liquid when it is colder than pure water, so it fits this niche pretty easily. It is plentiful, not harmful to the environment, and cheap, so there is little to no trouble in using it to cool your ice cream down. For sidewalks, you want to help the ice melt, and since salty water becomes liquid at lower temperatures, the salty water on the surface helps make the ice under it turn to salty water and thus melt. ___ TL;DR: water can hold tons of heat, but sucks at transferring heat, but colder water sucks less at transfer. Ice sucks more because it has pockets of air, both at the interface, and within it, and that sucks at holding heat. Salty water allows water to not be ice at colder temperatures, which means it is even colder than cold water, and has no pesky air in the way. This reminded me of a time a few years back, I asked my 13 yo son to go salt the sidewalk. Walked out to see what was taking him so long...uhm...he was using the kitchen salt shaker. I about peed my pants laughing so hard. Even funnier because he's a smart kid. Was a scholar athlete and is now a Corpsman. I still tease him about it. The goal of adding salt to ice in both cases is the same, to melt freshwater ice. The melting point of saltwater is lower than freshwater. By adding salt the ice melts. On the sidewalk, the slippery is gone. In the ice cream maker, the bucket is insulated so the heat energy required to melt the ice must come from the ice cream container which freezes the cream. The rotating container has a stationary dasher in it that keeps the cream from getting frozen solid on the sides and leaving liquid in the middle. The salt melts the ice in the outer layer of the ice cream machine. This sucks heat out of the inner layer, letting your ice cream freeze faster. Speaking from personal experience, you do NOT want the salt in the actual ice cream As long as the ice isn't too cold, salt does 2 things to ice at the same time: 1. Solid turns to liquid (ice melts). 2. The water absorbs heat from its surroundings as it melts. On the sidewalk or road, the ice melts, or at least the hard ice gets softer and can be physically removed. If it melts completely, the resulting water flows to lower ground, or is carried off on a tire or a shoe, or it eventually evaporates in the dry winter air, or it re-freezes if the weather gets cold enough. In the ice cream maker, the ice melts, pulling heat from whatever it is touching (the metal can with ice cream mix inside it). The resulting salt-water flows out the hole in the side of the ice cream maker and kills your grass. But it is replaced with more ice (which is as cold as the freezer). Salt is introduced to this new ice causing it to melt and pull even more heat from the can and its ice cream mix, rinse, repeat. Eventually, enough heat is pulled from the ice cream mix inside the mixer to cause it to freeze into ice cream. Without the salt, the ice would have a hard time pulling enough heat from the ice cream mix fast enough to freeze the mix in any reasonable amount of time (or with a reasonable amount of ice).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 84.43, 'recall': 5.63, 'fmeasure': 10.55}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 45.45, 'recall': 3.01, 'fmeasure': 5.64}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 56.56, 'recall': 3.77, 'fmeasure': 7.07}}"
How does oil lubricate an engine without combusting or contaminating the fuel?,"- The oil lubricates the engine by being a slippery substance. It reduces the friction of the moving parts so they don't wear out so quickly. - The oil is not burned in the engine, it is only used to lubricate the moving parts. - The oil is not contaminating the fuel because it is kept separate from the fuel. - The fuel is usually gasoline or diesel, which is not flammable.","The fuel is sprayed into the cylinders, where it mixes with air, is compressed, combusted and then evacuated out. Engine oil is not put directly into the cylinders. It gets pumped and directed to just about all of the other internal components though. What separates the inside of the cylinder from the rest of the inside of the engine, is a set of piston rings. And actually, a tiny bit of the engine oil gets in between the piston rings and the walls of the cylinders and lubricates that movement. As I understand it, a tiny bit of the oil does get caught up with the combustion of the fuel. An engine has an oil consumption rate. So even if you don't have any leaks, you eventually do have to add oil. It's usually pretty low and most people simply get to an oil change interval before actually having to add oil. But some (likely older) engines can go though oil much faster and will need to be topped up regularly. The oil and fuel are in two different areas and sealed off from each other by gaskets. And it doesn't ignite because it's ignition point is far higher than any temperature the engine achieves during normal operation. Not the answer, but incidentally two stroke engines actually use fuel mixes with oil. URL_0 Piston rings act as a seal. They are precision machined to a thousandth of an inch.

How are some car radios capable of spelling out song titles and artist names when tuning into some FM stations?,"Its a function of the radio's software, and how it's programmed to receive the information from the station. It's a feature that is built into the radio, and it's not a feature that is built into every radio. Some radios can do it, some can't.","Radio stations do a lot of clever work to fit more information in the audio stream then just the audio. Originally an FM station were just a simple mono audio signal. However they found out that the signal quality were good enough to deliver audio signals at much higher frequency then the humans can hear. So they composed the difference between the left and right audio channels and turned the pitch up higher then humans can hear and sent it out on the FM band. A stereo FM receiver were then able to split the audio signal based on pitch and turn the pitch down to its original pitch to then make stereo sound. Later on someone figured out that there were still a lot of unused signals above human hearing so they added a digital signal to a high pitch frequency so it can display the name of the radio station, what song is played and even codes for traffic information where it is supported. So the name of the song title is just part of a high pitch audio signals on the FM signal.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 52.0, 'recall': 13.98, 'fmeasure': 22.03}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.08, 'recall': 1.08, 'fmeasure': 1.71}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.0, 'recall': 8.06, 'fmeasure': 12.71}}"
Why is it so hard to reverse-engineer something? Shouldn't it be simple to just copy the parts exactly?,"It's actually relatively simple to reverse-engineer something. The problem is that it's illegal to reverse-engineer something that is patented. It's not illegal to reverse-engineer something that is not patented. It's actually a very common practice in software development. You can't just copy something exactly, because the patent covers the way it works, not the specific implementation. If you were to copy the implementation, you would be violating the patent.","No. Let's say you try and reverse engineer an iPhone. You need to know what each component is made of, this is NOT easy at all and requires some fairly high level analytical skills. You also need to know how each component talks to each other. An iPhone isn't just the solid stuff, and then OS installed; there is firmware that controls how say the capacitance from the screen is delivered to other bits of circuitry. There is software that controls the battery. Another example would be say a grain mill! You could build something that looks the same easily; a stone with an axel and then another stone on a pivot that can roll along in a circle. But if you don't know how to use it (the software) it's useless. With modern stuff the material becomes a big factor!! Touch screens are made of very special materials for one. Military hardware? Can also be very exotic composites, it's not just steel etc. Everyone is using House as an example, but what about a cake? You can analyze a cake and determine it's made of starch and sugars, but could you really reverse-engineer that to come up with a list of raw ingredients AND a recipe to recreate the cake? Even if I gave you the exact list of ingredients, but no directions for mixing them (quantity and order) or baking it, what good would that do you? Manufacturing engineer, here. It depends a lot on the complexity of the object and if there are critical parameters or tolerances. Reverse-engineering a simple table with square legs is easy. Now think of a nice table with a pattern lathe-turned into the legs and a stain. It may be difficult to determine the wood under the stain and the stain color. It will also take much longer to figure out the lathe tooling setup to replicate the legs. If the replica isn't exact, it could still be a nice table. When you consider mechanical and electronic items, the process is more difficult for a number of reasons. Electronic components are exponentially more complicated. If you can identify all the pieces, you still have to arrange them precisely. Imagine trying to copy a complete road map of Texas with a pencil and protractor - no tracing. If you manage to build the thing correctly, you still need to develop firmware and software so that it runs as closely as possible to what you are trying to reverse-engineer. a real life example is that you can take a look at a house. it has some walls, roof, windows. pretty simple easy to understand concepts. now you are in charge of building your own house, and you know what a house is made up of. now, how do you make a rebar? what is rebar made out of? steel? great! how do we create steel? it's easy to copy simple things with simple materials, but it's extremely difficult to copy advanced things manufactured with complicated manufacturing processes. yes. but you dont know the properties of all the parts involved. Or the reason they have that property. For example when the soviets tried to copy the american b29 bomber from b29's that had to land in russia, because they didn't know the purpose of all the parts, they [went as far as integrating the bullet holes]( URL_0 ), the planes had suffered into their copys. Without extensive testing, that sometimes includes the destruction of parts, you realy cant get all the material properties right. Add to that, that sometimes you just dont have the technology to replicate the original and reverse engineering can become very dificult. Everyone here is talking about the manufacture of something, and they are explaining why copying things isn't easy...but that isn't reverse engineering. That's just trying to duplicate something. Copying stuff is easy. If you look at a piece of electronic equipment, a good chunk of the chips and processors are off the shelf. You can go and buy them and slap them all together and there you go. But that isn't reverse engineering, that's just assembling something. If company x builds a cool thing, and company y can't figure out how they did it on their own, company y then needs to buy the thing from company x and do a complete analysis of it. Reverse engineering isn't about copying something. So company y brings in the engineers to look at every single component and wire, and then write up the full specs based on what they see in the hardware. Going back to everyone's house analogy, it's basically looking at a house and then drawing up blueprints. It's not nearly as complicated as figuring out how to manufacture steel, but it isn't easy. It's time consuming and tedious. This is what reverse engineering is. Looking at a product, and then figuring out exact specifications for it. After you get your full list of specifications, you hand that off to another completely clean and brand new team to actually design something based on those specifications created from the original product from company x. Now company y has a product similar to company x, but they have plausible deniability that they copied anything. Say you have 20. Did you make it by adding 5+5+5+5, or multiplying 4 x 5, or subtracting 10 from 30? Just having a part's measurements does not give you the information about the manufacturing techniques involved, which have a huge effect on the part's performance. Furthermore, operating the resultant product requires a decent understanding of how it works. Blind replication won't just get you nowhere, it's not as simple as you'd like to think. Ask me to make a lightbulb from scratch? I know enough of how to smelt and refine ores, blow glass, etc. that I could do it in under 3 months if you dropped me in the middle of the woods with the food/shelter to keep me and my project safe. Hell, with half a year I could make a power source to light it up as well, might need all of one community college course or two days in a library beforehand to fill in a few blanks. I'd almost consider doing it for a few grand at the end before remembering I could make more at minimum wage in that timeframe. Now, hand me a bulb, any bulb, and tell me to make that exact one? Hah. Fuck that. And you wanna know why? Specifics, my dear! I could be on Franklin's heels in a quarter of a year because I spend too much time on Wikipedia and lack a legitimately worthwhile outlet for my curiosity, and I'm reading about something that can be done successfully with fairly modest margins of error before it fails to work. I can almost ballpark a working plan to make everything I need from the stone hatchet and hammer to the turbine wheel powered by a creekbed or steam (or hell, hamster wheel using improvised woodland critters!) on the fly. Such is the power of decades of complacent fact-collecting paired with an overactive imagination that likes to ground itself firmly in ""bullshit that just might fucking work!"" But tell me to make that lightbulb. Any one fucking lightbulb. And let me do it in the city, with a project budget of a few grand? I will firmly tell you to go fuck yourself in your round hole with a square peg, and that's only because I don't know a wittier way to tell you to do it with the star-shaped peg. Because I can't be fucked to figure out what filament your bulb uses, if it's filled with x gas, normal air, a vacuum, etc. I don't wanna fuck with making the screw-in base. I don't wanna spend the time being a good enough glass blower to make the bulb the perfect shape, let alone figure out what kinda sand and additional minerals and whateverthefuck goes into it. And I don't want to fucking stamp the goddamn ink on the bulb, or lettering into the base. TL;DR Franken-fucking together a functional science experiment is easy because your target outcome has Texas-sized borders. Counterfeiting has pinhole-sized borders, so it's harder even if you're just making saltwater taffy. It's easy to mix yellow and blue to get green. It's hard to get blue and yellow FROM green. It is actually really really hard and expensive. Part of what makes companies rich are knowing how to making things cheaply. Anyone can make an iPhone. The trick is making it for $500 instead of $5 million. So even if you managed to figure out all the parts, you still don't know Apple's secrets of making an iPhone. Say you've got a cup of coffee. We know that was made from coffee beans and hot water, but how would you find that out if you didn't know? You can't get coffee beans back out of coffee. You can analyze the coffee with some expensive equipment and find out what chemicals are in it, but you can't find out where they came from. Now let's consider an electronic device. It probably has some IC chips in it. You can't just take them apart and figure out how they work. It would be extremely expensive to analyze them on a microscopic level and figure out how to make an identical chip. All you can realistically do is measure the inputs and outputs and try to figure out how they're related. So, you're limited by what you can actually observe and measure. It's often impossible or impractical to determine exactly how something was manufactured. Parts are not always simple discrete pieces that can be measured on their own. Lets think about a metal part you need to rebuild because its broken but you have no exact design for it. Now you go for an 3D scanner, scan the bad boy and create a mold for your new component. Then you pour in the metal and give it time to cool down. You wrap the component out of his mold, but it will be smaller than the part which broke down. That because metal shrink when it cools down. To merge out this problem, quite much engineering work has to be done and even then the piece wouldnt be like the broken one. To carry the house analogy further, how do you know what gauge (thickness) wire to use for the electrical outlets, or how the plumbing is laid out. These things are buried inside the walls and invisible to you unless you start knocking down walls. There are many things like this in a house that you cannot see, and thus cannot replicate precisely. And it may not just be items you cannot see, but how they were made. When looking at a product you are only seeing the final result; how it ended up that way may not be obvious. Take christmas tree tinsel for example. Seeing the final result in the box tells you very little about how they are able to package it so cleanly. And it is actually very difficult to do; companies try hard to keep the exact method a secret. In both cases what we are really talking about is information. Some of the information needed to copy an object may be hidden or may not exist in the object at all. The big trick with reverse-engineering is being able to infer what you cannot see from what you can see. A more modern example: Some programmable computer chips come with fuses that can be blown after being programmed. This prevents any changes and prevents anyone from reading the program back out. One way reverse-engineering folks get around this is with a special machine that can shave off epoxy covering of a chip and expose the raw circuits inside the chip. Then they proceed to poke the chip with several very sharp sticks (probes) to learn how it was programmed.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 80.52, 'recall': 2.99, 'fmeasure': 5.77}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 28.95, 'recall': 1.06, 'fmeasure': 2.05}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 59.74, 'recall': 2.22, 'fmeasure': 4.28}}"
"on my Honda, there's an ""eco"" button that's supposed to help me save gas. Why wouldn't they just make that a permanent feature on the car instead of a button?","It's a marketing ploy to make the car seem more eco-friendly. If you're not aware of the difference, you might think it's a permanent feature and that's what they want.","Because Eco-mode gives up a lot of power and throttle response in exchange for (slightly) better fuel economy. I have a Honda Pilot, and Eco-mode is very frustrating and even somewhat dangerous in many situations such as merging, going up hills, or passing. You punch the accelerator and... not much happens. I would not want this as the default setting on that car. I only ever use Eco-mode when cruising down long stretches of highway. Sometimes people want more acceleration. Eco mode makes you accelerate slower and the engine outputs less power. ""Econ"" reduces acceleration as well as A/C strength (to a small degree). There is also Sport mode in the models like the Civic (I have the 2016 Touring model), which increases throttle response and makes acceleration quicker, as well as simulates a higher gear (engine braking). Everything has a cost. You don't just use less gas because you pushed a button and get the same performance as before. If you want more power, you need to give up speed, if you want speed, you sacrifice power. Eco mode usually turns off some cylinders from being used turning a V8 or V6 into a V4 engine. If you are burning less fuel, you are getting less power. More than enough to drive but acceleration will be slower and even top speed, though still beyond the speed limit.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 45.71, 'recall': 6.87, 'fmeasure': 11.94}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.94, 'recall': 0.43, 'fmeasure': 0.75}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.43, 'recall': 4.72, 'fmeasure': 8.21}}"
"; Why does traffic construction, (like an intersection), seem to take so much longer than other construction projects of equivalent size (like a medium sized building)? There seems to be huge stretches of time where little to know progress is made. What's going on?","You're right, it does seem like construction projects take forever, but it's actually a really hard thing to measure. For one thing, there's no standard way to measure how long a project should take, and there's no standard way to measure how long a project takes. There are different ways to measure how long a project takes, and different ways to measure how long it should take. For example, the standard way to measure how long a project should take is to look at the project's scope, and then look at how long similar projects have taken in the past. If the project's scope is similar to other projects, then you can use the average time to measure how long the project should take. But this method has some problems. For one thing, it's really hard to measure how similar projects are. For example, if you're comparing a building project to a road project, then you might think that they're similar, but the amount of work involved might actually be completely different. For another thing, it's really hard to measure how long a project should take. For example, you might think that a road project should take 3 months, but then you might find out that there's a lot of unexpected work involved, and the project ends up taking 6 months. So the standard way of measuring how long a project should take is actually pretty hard.  ","1. Utilities in the work area need to be located by hand excavation (that's the law) 2. Utility relocation, protection, and support can be tedious and time consuming. Gas, steam, and electric are dangerous to relocate, therefore every precaution is taken. Telecom relocation is time consuming due to copper and fiber splicing. Water may only be able to be taken out of service at certain times. Sewer is typically fairly deep and time consuming to shore up trenches. 3. Materials cannot often be brought in and stock piled due to space restrictions. Depending on where you're working, they might not allow you to store any materials on site. This means everything has to be brought in when it's needed, even the excavation equipment might need to be removed and delivered daily. 4. Truck loads of material brought in (fill, concrete, pipe) have to be ordered and picked up or scheduled for delivery. Example: you order a concrete truck and it sits in a traffic jam, it gets there late. If it's been spinning in the drum too long, it's no longer any good and the load is rejected. Now you wait for another load to come. 5. Work permits typically stipulate the times you can work. I've gotten permits where we could only work 10am - 2pm, Monday - Thursday or 8am - 6pm Weekends only. Subtract at least an hour of productivity from that for opening up the job site and cleaning up. 6. Unforeseen circumstances cause a lot of delay (inadequate design on the engineer's part, poor planning on the contractor's part, utilities not known about until the tooth of a machine bucket ripped through it.) This is not to say that some of this doesn't happen in building construction, it does, but their job sites are usually less constrained than road work. Source: Civil Engineer, worked construction in NYC for 10 years. Just for starters: There's a ton of ancient and delicate infrastructure under any urban street and there aren't great records of what-all is down there (and you can't see it until you've put a backhoe through it.) Some of that stuff is natural gas lines -measure thrice, cut once. If you built your medium-sized building underground you would be comparing apples to apples. There's also the matter of money and resources. Most streets and roads are publicly funded whereas most buildings are private, with additional dollars associated to completing it on time and on budget. There's more money to be made in the commercial sector and a larger pool of subcontractors to choose from, unlike in municipal projects where you can only choose workers that have already been certified to work for the state/county. It's also a different skill-set. My brother who was a roofer for hotels could switch to residential without much trouble. But the electricians/ plumbers who work on municipal projects usually have much more training. Many times if you see the same orange cones up for a long period of time its because they're waiting on someone specialized enough to do the work or certify the work was done correctly. Source: friends and family who work private sector construction. Please correct any misstatements on the public side. /u/Dennaldo has the most comprehensive answer, but didn't touch on crew scheduling -- maybe it wasn't an issue in NYC! You or your prime contractor may or may not have all the various crews that a project needs, available at the drop of a hat -- many construction projects are scheduled a year in advance. The sewer-pipe crew, for example, might be multitasking several road projects at once, since each of them doesn't need a full-time sewer crew. But, they may be working on project 17 on the other side of town for a couple more days when your project is ready for them again. So, everybody shifts to something else for a while. The worst thing to have happen is to have a crew show up on their scheduled-weeks-in-advance day, and **you're not ready** -- your project has been delayed by weather, or a previous task isn't quite ready yet. So, to keep that crew busy, they get sent (out of order, so to speak) to a different project, and YOU WAIT. To accomodate this, your project scheduler may allocate a week for three days worth of work now and then, so that a previous crew can lose a day without impacting the rest of the project. That's another reason why it may look like nothing is happening -- scheduled slack that turned out not to be needed.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 56.05, 'recall': 17.59, 'fmeasure': 26.78}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.17, 'recall': 4.44, 'fmeasure': 6.76}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.0, 'recall': 7.85, 'fmeasure': 11.95}}"

"How do our sanitary systems filter out the waste and unwanted objects that we flush, such as pencils or chewing gum, to produce clean water?","Љ�t: Water treatment is a complex process that involves several steps. The first step is to collect the wastewater, which is done through a system of pipes that take the wastewater from homes, businesses and industries and transport it to a treatment plant. The wastewater is then treated through physical, chemical and biological processes. The physical processes include sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. The chemical processes include the use of chemicals to remove impurities from the water. The biological processes include the use of microorganisms to remove impurities from the water. The wastewater is then discharged into the environment or reused. The wastewater can be discharged into a river or a lake, or it can be reused in industrial processes. The water that is discharged into the environment must meet certain standards before it is discharged. The water can also be reused in industrial processes. The water that is reused is known as recycled water. Recycled water is used for a variety of purposes. The most common purpose is for irrigation, which is the use of recycled water for the irrigation of crops. Recycled water is also used for cooling systems, industrial processes and toilet flushing. There are several types of water treatment processes. The most common is called activated sludge.  ","Typically they don't turn waste water into clean drinking water. In most places, the water is cleaned until it's safe enough to dump back into a nearby waterway, like a river, where it can be washed out to sea. Some places truly recycle water, but it's a lot more expensive and energy intensive. Regardless, the process to clean water involves running it through a series of filters, each removing smaller and smaller debris, before chemically treating the water to kill off anything left living in it.

How does the lever that reduces glare in your rearview mirror work?,"The mirror is coated with a thin layer of metallic oxide. The oxide has a high refractive index, which means that it bends light more than air.

What is the difference between an EM-drive and a microwave?,"In short: Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation, like light, but they are at a higher frequency and have more energy. This means they can penetrate materials and cause the water molecules inside to vibrate. When they vibrate, they collide with each other and with the walls of the container, which generates heat. The frequency of microwaves is a bit higher than visible light, so they can penetrate most materials. The frequency of microwaves is so high that they can cause the water molecules in a substance to vibrate. When the water molecules collide, they heat up. This is the same effect as when you heat up water with a stove. The water molecules collide and heat up. The microwaves are like the stove, the water is the substance that is heated. The microwaves are the stove. The water is the substance being heated.","The basic element in both is a magnetron, or a different kind of of microwave source, but, instead of aiming them at food, they > are directed into a metallic, fully enclosed conically tapered high Q resonant microwave cavity. Which is a sealed enclosure in the shape of a truncated cone. *Supposedly*, the smaller flat section on one end produces less force than the bigger section, hence ~~magic~~ thrust.

Why do cars have an air setting for legs/defrost but not face/defrost?," & #x200B; I'm not sure I understand what you are asking. Cars have air conditioning and defrosting for both the legs and the face. It's just that the face is usually the most important thing in the car. There is no good reason why the face should be warmer than the legs. If you're cold, you should turn on the defrosting, and if you're hot, you should turn it off. & #x200B; I think you might be asking why the face defrosting isn't on the same setting as the legs. The reason for that is that the face is much closer to the windshield than the legs, so it would be much hotter if it were on the same setting. The windshield is heated from the inside, and that's why you can see it. & #x200B; I'm not sure what you mean by ""not face/defrost."" The face is defrosted with the air conditioning, just like the legs. If you're cold, you turn on the air conditioning, and if you're hot, you turn it off. & #x200B; I hope that helps. If you have any more questions, I'll be happy to answer them.","Heat and defrost in a car are often related but different. In my car, there is one control for the vents that happens to also turn on the AC for the defrost settings. The defrost settings are either windshield or windshield plus feet. The purpose of turning on the AC is to dehumidify the air, removing fog from the windshield. In both cases, defrost implies hot air hitting the windshield. The windshield/foot setting is a compromise, as neither will be getting as much air as they would if it were exclusive. Because the air hitting the windshield quickly moves toward the vicinity of your head, it's good enough for the purpose of getting warm air to your face. You may need to turn up the fan speed to feel it. If you don't need to defog the windshield, you can of course just turn on the front vents. It's not necessary to have the AC going in this case, though in some conditions, you may want to and can turn the AC on manually. I vaguely recall some cars from decades ago that assumed the occupants couldn't handle separate settings for temperature and position, so always turned on the heat for foot and defrost and never turned it on for face. I've never purchased a car that dumbed down, and never will.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.22, 'recall': 38.6, 'fmeasure': 41.22}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.09, 'recall': 7.93, 'fmeasure': 8.47}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.11, 'recall': 18.42, 'fmeasure': 19.67}}"

"Why do you need a NASA lens to record candle lit scenes on film, yet the human eye is as small as a mobile phone camera and can see low lit scenes just fine?","The human eye is a very complex organ, and it has a number of features that are not present in a camera. The most important one is the ability to focus on a wide range of objects, from very small to very large. The human eye can focus on objects that are only a few millimeters in diameter, and it can also focus on objects that are several meters in diameter. The camera, on the other hand, is only able to focus on objects that are a few millimeters in diameter. This means that a camera is much less useful when trying to take pictures of objects that are far away, or that are very small. The human eye also has a much higher resolution than a camera. This means that the human eye is able to see much more detail than a camera. For example, if you look at a candle flame, you will see a lot of detail in the flame, like the tiny little flames that are inside the main flame. The camera, on the other hand, will only see a big, bright light, and will not be able to see the tiny little flames. The human eye also has a much wider field of view than a camera. This means that the human eye is able to see much more of the room around the candle than a camera. The human eye is also able to see more colors than a camera.  ","Our brain is incredibly powerful and can 'compute' the dynamic range and the white balance of everything we see. Even the the most expensive sensors on the best cameras available today can't recreate the wide dynamic range our eyes do for us, at least not without combining multiple images. Example. When driving through a tunnel as you approach the end your eyes see fantastic detail in the tunnel around you, AND in the bright outside the tunnel in front of you. Now try taking a photo of that (passenger!!) and see that you either get detail in the tunnel and super overexposed outside, or detail outside and underexposed inside. One day cameras may reach this level but not for a long while. You're thinking of the f0.7 lenses made in the 1960s and used both by NASA and Stanley Kubrick. He wanted to shoot motion pictures (35mm colour film) by candle light and, at that time, film sensitivity required such a fast lens to produce the required quality. Today, both film and digital sensors would be able to do the same job with f1.0 or even f1.4 lenses, which are commonly available. Professional DSLR lenses have f1.4 as a very common prime (non-zoom) aperture and f1.2 is also available. Today, pros use these more for their very narrow depth of field more than for their bright images, i.e., they want everything except the subject to be very out of focus and blurry. You can find lenses with f numbers at and under 1.0 but they are expensive specialist items. For example, there's an [f0.85]( URL_0 ) for $2000 which is only half a stop slower than the f0.7 NASA special from the 1960s. Modern digital cameras will happily shoot stills and videos with standard zoom lenses in candle light. The problem is that the images will be incredibly noisy unless you use long exposures that are impossible for moving subjects or for videos. The quality would be unsuitable for movie or TV production work. The human eye is actually not too different. Yes, you can see by candle light, but your colour perception is missing or very muted and there is the equivalent of noise present. The human eye has a maximum aperture around f2.1, over three stops (eight times) slower (dimmer) than f0.7. A rod cell in your eye can resolve a *single* photon. This can also be done with technology, but it requires relatively huge photo-multiplier tubes which are found in scientific apparatus and not consumer or professional cameras. The signal from the rod cells needs to be about 5 photons to be strong enough to reach the brain and be registered though, but 5 photons is still FAR better than a cheap CCD can do (I include $100k+ professional cameras in ""cheap"". ""expensive"" is the types of detectors used in multi- hundred million dollar particle accelerators that are the size of a cathedral - they can also detect single photons) (This is also helped by the insane dynamic range a human eye can achieve as the brain scales the output of individual photo receptors as needed, where a modern camera scales the output of all photo receptors together) There's a lot of crap here that either doesn't answer you or is just plain wrong.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 56.91, 'recall': 24.82, 'fmeasure': 34.57}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.43, 'recall': 4.97, 'fmeasure': 6.93}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.8, 'recall': 10.82, 'fmeasure': 15.06}}"
"Why are semis that carry liquid cylindrical, and not rectangular?","In the case of rail cars, it's because the rails are curved, and the cars have to be able to negotiate the curves. The long, cylindrical shape of the rail cars helps with this. For trucks, it's more of a design choice. It's not necessary for the trucks to be curved, and it's more convenient for them to be rectangular.","Curved structures are mechanically stronger at storing contents under pressure. The pressure is pushing evenly of all sides of a curved surface, so they are less likely to burst. If you have lines or corners there is uneven distribution of load on the interior of vessel. More info can be found here: URL_0 * cylinders are stronger than rectangles...liquid loads tend to be heavier and can slosh, putting more strain on the trailer than solid loads * a filled tank of most liquids is already operating at near the maximum load limit, there is little advantage to providing extra space * the shape makes it easier to drain Also, most tankers have multiple baffles or compartments in them. The weight transfer from thousands of gallons of liquid sloshing around, can easily overcome braking force and. An also causing roll overs on turns Think of it in this way: Most materials are a lot stronger when you pull them and not bend them. Just think of a piece of paper. It can handle a lot of force when you pull it, but it will have literally no resistance for bending it. With metal it is exactly the same, only that metal itself is a lot stronger. When you weld metal together as a tube, it is a clever design, so when you put pressure inside the tube, the tube will try to expand. But to expand, its circumference would have to get bigger. And this means that the force caused by the pressure was converted into ""pulling-force"" circular around the circumference. With a rectangular container this wouldn't work. On the edges, the pressure will try to bend up the edges and usually the container will fail/rip open. But just imagine the rectangular container to be of a very bendable material, like rubber. Now apply pressure inside. As the pressure increases, the rectangular container will deform and end up circular.

Why do boy bikes typically have a bar across the top whereas girl bikes do not?,"In the 1970s, when most children rode bikes, there was a very real concern about children being hit by cars. In order to be able to see cars coming, a bar was added to the top of bikes. As bikes became more popular, it was found that girls were more likely to ride bikes and that the bar was a problem for them. So, in the 1980s, manufacturers began removing the bar and making the bikes more comfortable for girls. The bar is not a safety feature, it is an aesthetic feature. It was originally added to prevent the rider from getting their head knocked off when they hit a tree or a low-hanging branch. The bar was originally made of metal, but it was later replaced with plastic, and it was later removed altogether. The reason it is more common on boy bikes is because the first bikes were made for boys, and the design was never changed.","Women used to wear long dresses to used to have to have to ""step through"" the frame in order to preserve their modesty. Males on the other hand could just pop their leg over the top. The tradition has just been maintained on most commercial bikes. It's a carry-over from the days when girls and women only work dresses or skirts-and-blouse outfits. The bar on a ""men's"" bike would make riding one in a dress quite awkward. I thought this was a holdover from olden times, when girls' bikes had to accommodate for dresses. Because girls traditionally wear skirts and dresses which get pushed up by the bar on boys bikes. In Scotland boys bikes also have the low crossbar because of the tradition of wearing kilts. As for 2, it's because of physics. Both men and women's bikes have the bar, which is necessary to form a truss in the central bike structure which is far, far stronger than just a single pipe. The only difference is the women's bar connects much lower than the men's, which structurally makes it weaker. This is due to a combination of men being physically heavier and that stereotypically men do more mountain biking/crazy outdoor stunts which would require the stronger frame. Where or not that's really true, men's bikes are actually the better design from a strength standpoint, and the altered frame on women's bikes is a concession due to the whole skirt thing and it's stuck around for marketing purposes. Women used to wear dresses/skirts. They still do, but they used to too. The design of the front half of a bike is referred to as the ""front triangle"" (the portion of the frame from the forks to the seatpost). Triangles are the strongest shape in nature because forced is added/displaced equally on all three sides. The step-through frame, generally regarded as a ""woman's"" bike was to allow a woman to get onto the bike while wearing a dress/skirt (they are different things). The ability to use a bicycle was hugely liberating for women when first introduced. While the step-through allowed women (and those with hip issues) the ability to get on a bike, structurally the frame is not as strong as the triangle (where the top tube is much higher). There was the [Penny in Yo Pants initiative]( URL_0 ), demonstrating a trick using pocket change to allow women in skirts to ride bicycles. There isn't really anything in cycling that is ""gender specific"". Men and womens seats now have options that have no center channel. Beyond that, it's just a matter of frame size - cranks, gears, wheels, handlebars (incl. tape) is a lot of personal preference and bike fit. I used to rent bikes. Low step are still good now particularly for people with hip or leg issues. I had an elder man renting specifically request the low step option for this reason. Also good for people who might lose their balance swinging a leg around, and of course, riding in compromising clothing. WSD options (low step) typically have a shorter distance from person to handle bars. This smaller space was built intentionally with women and their shorter wing span in mind. Personally I like having the bar there, and I do happen to have a longer wing span, so I typically take the male option of bikes.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.13, 'recall': 16.01, 'fmeasure': 25.1}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.95, 'recall': 3.28, 'fmeasure': 5.14}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.75, 'recall': 7.92, 'fmeasure': 12.42}}"

Their resistance changes with temperature. It is measured for each pixel and converted to a false color display. An interesting quirk is that they aren't good at measuring temperature accurately, so a shutter is periodically activated so they can calibrate the temperature to the temperature of the shutter blade which is in turn measured by a nearby conventional temperature sensor. All the pixels are then calibrated against that temperature. The electromagnetic spectrum is large, the visible part is small.

What are the benefits that zero-G environments provide to science or manufacturing?,"It's not really a zero-G environment. It's more like a low-G environment. The ISS is only in orbit at a height of 400 km, and that's just 1/7 of the Earth's radius. The Earth's surface is only 1/4 of the Earth's volume. So the gravity on the ISS is only about 1/7 of the gravity on Earth. That's why you can see the Earth's curvature from the ISS. In fact, the gravity on the ISS is about the same as on the Moon. The reason the ISS is in orbit is that it's easier to launch things into orbit than to launch them into space. It's also easier to send things into orbit than to send them to the Moon or Mars. The ISS is about 450 km in diameter, and it's made up of about 60 modules that are connected together. The modules are about 20 meters long and 4 meters wide, and they're made out of metal and plastic. The ISS is powered by solar panels and batteries, and it's controlled by computers. The ISS is also connected to the Earth by a communications cable. The ISS is used for all sorts of scientific research.  ","At the moment its mainly for science. Not much commercial activity in space yet, outside of communication and observation satellites. The main things that benefit from zero G are things to do with crystal formation, like alloys. Say you have a big pot of molten metal alloy. As it solidifies, some alloys form tiny crystals called dendrites. The way these dendrites overlap and intertwine determines the properties of the resulting alloy. In gravity dendrites are subjected to all kinds of convection currents, density fluctuations etc. As such, they grow in very irregular shapes and break before they grow too large. Therefore it is very hard to make an alloy that lives up to its theoretical properties. In space all these flows and currents are drastically reduced, or eliminated entirely. As such you get a much better alloy. Same thing for many other things relating to crystal formation. Zero G allows for bigger, purer crystals. If we look a few decades into the future, there are many things that could benefit from a space environment (provided launch costs go down, or we use materials readily available in space). Zero-G means you don't need to worry about support. This allows for much more versatile manufacturing methods. For example, right now silicium wafers used for semiconductor manufacturing are 300mm in diameter. Any bigger than that and the wafer flexes too much. In space the wafer won't flex due to gravity, as such you could conceivably have wafers tens of meters in diameter. Space is also a fantastic vacuum, which would really benefit semiconductor manufacture. Another cool thing about space is that liquid droplets will quickly form perfect spheres thanks to surface tension. This is pretty useful for several industrial processes. Zero G also allows you to mix normally unmixable gasses/liquids. Oil and water don't mix on earth, because the oil floats on top of water. In space they'll form a great emulsion for long periods of time. This allows for chemistry that's difficult or impossible on earth. Space is also a great place for dangerous processes. If some industrial accident leaks thousands of tonnes of neurotoxics into the environment its a terrible disaster on earth. In space nobody would give a shit, outside of lost profit. All in all, space manufacture would be pretty useful. But only if launch costs come waaaaay down, or we start exploiting asteroids and set up a nearly independent industry in space.

"If coaxial is good enough to get the signal inside, why do we use all kinds of other connections (HDMI, Ethernet etc...)","Coaxial is a signal carrier, not a data carrier. HDMI and Ethernet are data carriers. They're designed to carry different types of data. HDMI is a digital audio and video carrier. It's designed to carry audio and video signals from a source (like a Blu-ray player) to a display device (like a TV). It's a very high bandwidth signal, and it's designed to carry audio and video in a very specific way. HDMI is not designed to carry anything else. HDMI is also not designed to carry data.

It's designed to carry data between devices. It's a very high bandwidth signal, and it's designed to carry data in a very specific way. Ethernet is not designed to carry audio or video. Ethernet is not designed to carry audio or video.","The coaxial signal is very high frequency analog. It takes significant electronics to decode it and encode an outgoing signal. The box that does this is called a modem (MOdulator-DEModulator). If you add that electronics to every thing, it would significantly increase the cost, over a digital system like HDMI. High frequency analog signals are also subject to cosite interference when you have more than one of them inside a box, so things would need lots of metal boxes to put the components in. Net result, it would cost a lot more. Because coax is essentially carrying radio signals, and anything working over it includes a full radio transceiver. Essentially it's much more similar to using wifi cards. You could replace your Ethernet connection with wifi cards connected via coax instead of antennas, it would probably work, but it's much more expensive than Ethernet, and significantly slower. It's a similar issue with HDMI, a current HDMI cable can be powered by a $25 raspberry pi zero (so whatever HDMI needs is less than that), but HDMI handles 48Gbps of data, much much more than your $100 cable modem is capable of. While a cable modem using current tech can be made to push 48Gbps over coax, it would really require 100 times the hardware to generate the right signals, making it a $10k modem, and you need one on each end of the cable. Because each of those things have specific standards (physical and electrical) that were developed independently - many of them prior to the introduction of consumer Internet services from cable TV companies. Phones, for example, have used the same cabling, modular connectors, and signalling for 40+ years. Could you run phones directly over coax? Sure, but what would the benefit be compared to the expense of abandoning millions of existing phones. Years ago, we used to run Ethernet over coaxial cable. However, coax tends to be bulky and hard to work with, and the devices used to propagate the signal introduce multiple failure points to the network. So, networking switched over to twisted pair cable in the late 80s/early 90s. TP wiring is easier to work with and is less expensive than coax. HDMI was developed in the early 2000s, to provide higher quality digital AV between devices. It's no coincidence that HDMI came on the heals of wider adoption of DVD, and was developed around the same time as Blu-Ray. Each of the standards is optimized for its specific function and, after the cable comes into your home, the signals the cable company sends must be converted, by your modem, into the type that can be used by the connected device. Another piece of insight here. From what I remember from college. The coaxial cable is essentially lossless. It can be run for miles and miles without signal degradation. You can't do that with ethernet. For simplicity sake, essentially you can't run Cat5e more than 100 meters (~300+ feet) at a time without a repeater to regenerate the signal and send it out again. Cat6 is the same at 1000base-T but it's more often used for 10GBase-T, or 10 gigabit per second rate, which means its maximum distance is about 55 meters. HDMI is the same story, topping out at 50 feet before signal degradation. [Here's a decent source]( URL_1 ) Notice the RG-59 Coax doesn't show a max length. IIRC from college, that's thanks to shielding and most importantly, impedance matching. [Wikipedia sources for support]( URL_0 ) Especially the ""matched load"" section there where it says ""for all l."" If you tried to do the same thing that Coax is used for by using ethernet cables, it would cost you a fortune in repeaters alone. You can't do everything with Coax either. It has limits on splits. It's better for getting signal between 2 points, but not well suited for your network backbone like ethernet. There are pros and cons to all types of cables and their usefulness depends on application needs.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.36, 'recall': 16.52, 'fmeasure': 25.65}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.67, 'recall': 2.49, 'fmeasure': 3.87}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.4, 'recall': 7.6, 'fmeasure': 11.8}}"

"In the winter, when we 'heat up' our cars, what is going on mechanically that is actually better for the car than driving it immediately?",The engine is run at a lower temperature in the winter so it doesn't wear out as quickly.

It's better to warm up before running.,"In theory you want the metal parts to heat evenly before stress is placed on them. Cold things are generally more brittle which means they would crack instead of bending. In reality modern cars don't need any time to warm up.

Nothing - Modern engines are computer controlled and only need enough time for the oil to redistribute for ""heating up"".

How has the steering wheel/accelerator gone basically unchanged throughout the automobile's history while most everything else in a car has been updated or changed?,"It's because the US has a law that makes it illegal to use a phone while driving, and the UK doesn't have such a law. So the US has decided to just make it illegal to use a phone while driving, but the UK has decided to let people use their phones if they want to. I think it's because the US has a very strict no-cellphone-use-while-driving law. There are some states that have laws that make it illegal to use a cellphone while driving, but the majority of states don't. Some states are more strict than others. In my state, you can't use your phone at all while driving, but you can use it while stopped. In another state, you can use your phone while driving but you have to use a hands-free device. Some states have laws that prohibit texting while driving. Some states have laws that prohibit all phone use while driving. It depends on the state you are in.","The alternatives like joysticks or trackpads have several problems: they make it too easy to make sudden sharp turns that would cause the car to skid. They require power steering and have no way to work if the power fails. They also don't make it easy to give physical feedback to their driver. I can't think of anything better than a wheel. You can turn it many times to get to full lock which makes it great for manoeuvring and parking. It won't accidentally get turned too much while the car is moving at speed. It's easy to keep it turned to the same degree - you just hold it in place where as a joystick is more work. It is NOT the singular design. Early automobiles had many different control designs. Ford model T has 3 foot pedals: brake, reverse and clutch. And 2 hand levers: ebrake/mode lever and gear selector. The throttle is a hand lever on the steering column I'd say the steering wheel actually has changed a lot. Think of all of the technology now present in a steering wheel- first it connects to a power steering system that assists you in turning the vehicle, rather than using brute strength. Next, think of all the buttons for things such as cruise control, and media center control. Finally, the steering wheel is now part of the safety design of a car, with an airbag inside to protect you in the event of a collision. On the contrary, steering wheels have been endlessly tweaked and redesigned. The shape, auxiliary controls, angle, displays, etc have all been changed -- the only constant is that it's a ""thing you turn"". For example, here's a gif of how Formula 1 steering wheels have evolved over the decades: [F1wheels]( URL_0 ) Lots of early cars didn't have accelerator pedals like cars do today; many ran at a fixed acceleration (ie, ON), and you used gears to change your speed (roughly; 1= 5mph, 2 =12mph, 3=20mph, etc).

"How can an autonomous (self driving) car work in adverse weather conditions? (Snow, ice, etc)","Snow and ice are a problem for autonomous cars because they are not easily visible. For example, if a car is driving on the road and suddenly slides into the other lane, the autonomous car may not be able to see it. In addition, the sensors and cameras that the car uses to detect the road and other cars may be less effective in snowy conditions. The car's sensors can be improved to detect better in snowy conditions, but it would be expensive to do so. Also, the car would need to be able to drive in snow and ice, which is not something that is currently possible. Another problem with snow and ice is that the car's sensors may be covered. For example, the cameras on the car may be covered with snow and ice, which means the car won't be able to see the road. In order to deal with these problems, autonomous cars are designed to be able to drive in snowy and icy conditions. They use special tires that are designed to be able to drive in snow and ice. They also have special sensors that are designed to be able to detect the road in snowy conditions. For example, they use radar sensors that are able to detect objects in snow. They also use cameras that are designed to be able to see objects in snow.  ","They can't right now. That's why they're primarily being tested in southern states. It's a seldom publicized but openly admitted limitation of the technology. When the roads are obscured the systems are unable to determine where lanes are or even roads in general do when they cannot detect those things they cannot be engaged. The makers openly admit that snow ice and even heavy rain prove a significant obstacle that they're working to get around. As far as I'm aware all systems on the market today will disengage themselves in these conditions as a safety precaution, or prevent you from engaging them in the first place. The same way you do. It can pretty easily determine the weather and road conditions. In fact, it would probably drive *better* than you in such circumstances since it will be aware of such driving conditions while many drivers just drive the same way they normally do (including going way too fast for the conditions).

"How 3D movies went from using blue/red cellophane glasses to just ""sunglasses""?","3D movies use polarized light. Blue light is polarized horizontally and red light is polarized vertically. When you wear glasses with blue and red lenses, the blue light is blocked by the blue lens and the red light is blocked by the red lens. This makes the light coming from the screen appear 3D. You can also use polarized glasses with no lenses at all. This is the ""passive"" version of 3D glasses. The light from the screen is polarized, and the glasses just block the light in the right way to make it appear 3D.","The key idea of any 3d is to project 2 images on to the screen, and have each eye register only one of them. With red/blue, you would show one image in only blue color, and another image in only red color, using different shades of red. If you looked at the entirely-red-shades image through lens that was color red, you would see just, well, red. But if you saw it through blue lens, you would see all the different shades. Likewise for blue. Thus, you get(with wonky colors) 2 different images, one for each eye, which then could be used to do 3d. Modern tech however uses polarization, that is, the direction light is sorta ""waving"" at. Light is a wave, and it has direction, orthogonal to the direction it's going, where it's ""waving"" at. Typically white light does this waving thing in all sorts of directions, and it's a mess, but there are filters which can block all but certain orientation of this waving. Having one image transmitted only using light that's of certain orientation, and then have lenses of your glasses selectively block these orientations allows again you to transmit only one of the two images to both eyes. I don't know how expensive this new polarization technique is, but I can tell you that you can do pretty good job with this red/blue lens thing with very cheap materials, video device you use to show your red/blue 3d film has absolutely no special requirements, and it's pretty cheap to make appropriate glasses, so that probably explains why people historically did use this red/blue 3d thing despite color problems. Polarized light is the secret. To your eye, polarized light looks like normal light. Normal light has waves, right? Normally, these waves kinda bounce every which way. But with a filter, you can ensure the waves only go one way, for example vertical. So what the 3D projector does is show two images, one composed of vertically poliarized light, one of horizontally polarized light, on top of each other. One glasses lens filters the one polarization, and the other filters the other polarization. So each eye now sees a different image. [Here's a handy lil diagram]( URL_0 ). For the other lens, the opposite would be true, the horizontal light would get past the filter but the vertical would not.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 78.12, 'recall': 18.47, 'fmeasure': 29.88}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.53, 'recall': 2.47, 'fmeasure': 4.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 36.46, 'recall': 8.62, 'fmeasure': 13.94}}"
How are big items loaded in to a submarine.,"It's not a submarine, but I can explain how a container ship is loaded. The ship has a crane that lifts containers off the ground and places them on the ship. The crane is mounted on a boom that can be extended or retracted. The boom is attached to the ship by a pivot point. The boom is also equipped with a hook that can be used to lift containers. The crane can lift containers weighing up to 100 tons, but this depends on the strength of the crane and the ship's structure. The crane has a winch that can be used to pull the boom into position. The winch is powered by a diesel engine or an electric motor. The winch can also be used to pull the boom out of position. Once the boom is in position, the crane can lift the container off the ground. The crane uses a hydraulic system to lift the container. The hydraulic system consists of a pump, a reservoir, and a hydraulic cylinder. The pump is powered by a diesel engine or an electric motor. The reservoir stores hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic cylinder is a cylinder filled with hydraulic fluid.  ","The normal accesses to the boat are removable, making a much larger hole for loading items in or out. Anything larger than those openings require cutting and welding the hull. This is my favorite question I've seen all day... Reddit's curiosity never ceases to amaze me. They plan those things before they finish the sub. They could also probably dismantle the fridge and put it back together inside the sub. Or just specially-designed things that can be taken apart. There are special tube ports for loading the torpedoes. The refrigerator components can be assembled inside. Submarines have changed over the years. The limit on mission is often the food. Large tin cans were stacked on the floor. Sailors walked on them until they were consumed. After everything was loaded potatoes were stored in one of the access hatches. If they went bad the smell was awful. Showers were very limited. The generator rooms were hot. There was a reason they were called pig boats. Nuclear submarines have a lot of power. So they can desalinate a lot of water. Much better duty. I would think it depends on what that big item is and where it is installed in the submarine. Replacing the nuclear reactor would require some serious reconstruction. A fridge on a sub is likely a custom fridge assembled from modular components that fit through a hatch.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 31.0, 'recall': 26.72, 'fmeasure': 28.7}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.02, 'recall': 3.46, 'fmeasure': 3.72}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.5, 'recall': 15.09, 'fmeasure': 16.2}}"
"Why has my town installed dual traffic lights at a busy roundabout, I thought the point of a roundabout was to keep traffic flowing and replace traffic lights.","It's not really a roundabout, it's a traffic circle. A roundabout is a circular junction where traffic flows counterclockwise. It's not really a good idea to put traffic lights in a roundabout, but it's also not a bad idea. The reason is that roundabouts are a lot safer than traffic lights, and they're also more efficient. When you put a roundabout in a place where traffic lights used to be, you're trying to improve safety. Roundabouts are safer than traffic lights because they have fewer conflicts. Traffic lights have four phases: 1. Red 2. Yellow 3. Green 4. Red. There are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, if you have a traffic light at an intersection, and you assume that the green light is on for 30 seconds, then you have a total of 180 seconds of green time per hour. This means that there are 180 seconds per hour where cars are allowed to go through the intersection. That's 3 minutes per hour, or 20 minutes per day. That's a lot of time where cars are allowed to go through the intersection, and that's a lot of time where there's a risk of a crash.  ","Roundabouts work very well when the traffic on both roads is approximately equal. Vehicles turning off one street create gaps in the traffic to let vehicles from the side street on, allowing an even use of the intersection. But if one road dominates with only through traffic, then side street traffic has no opportunity to get onto the roundabout. So occasionally they need to put stoplights on the through street, to allow cross-street traffic onto the roundabout and clear. I don't know where you are, but in the UK, roundabouts often have traffic lights. Traffic lights on their own can cause a queue of people waiting to turn right (that's in the UK where we drive on the left - if you drive on the right in your country then there'll be a queue of people waiting to turn left instead), as well as traffic being forced to stop at a red light. Roundabouts on their own get around these problems. Traffic turning right (in the UK - left if you drive on the right hand side of the road) can enter the roundabout at the same time as everyone else and keep moving, and you only have to stop if there's someone on the roundabout that has right of way. But roundabouts on their own bring their own set of problems. At a busy junction, traffic on the roundabout has priority, which can make it difficult for traffic to enter the junction, and result in queues on all of the entrances to the roundabout. And if you're entering from a quiet entrance (where not many people exit) then it can be long wait for a gap when the roundabout is busy. Traffic lights at roundabouts attempt to solve all of these problems. They're often only active during peak hours, because the problems with roundabouts don't occur when it's quiet. But during peak hours, they can give some priority to joining traffic (but never so much that there's gridlock on the roundabout itself - it's important that traffic on the roundabout be given more priority), and they can also create breaks in the traffic so that it's possible to join from quiet entrances.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 48.11, 'recall': 27.42, 'fmeasure': 34.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.06, 'recall': 4.58, 'fmeasure': 5.84}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.34, 'recall': 11.02, 'fmeasure': 14.04}}"
What a civil engineer does,"A civil engineer is a type of engineer that designs, builds and maintains physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, airports, water supply systems, sewage systems, and flood protection systems. They work on projects that require a combination of technical knowledge and social skills, and they often work with architects, urban planners, and other professionals to ensure that their designs are safe, functional, and meet the needs of the community. Civil engineers are also responsible for ensuring that their projects comply with local, national and international regulations and standards.","How unlike a civil engineer to give a super convoluted answer to a simple question. /s. Seriously - I asked a civil engineer once how they like their coffee and they gave me a 20 page report. :-P The reason your boyfriend gives a convoluted answer though is because what he does is actually an extremely complicated job. The very short answer though is that they build stuff. Stuff like roads, bridges, tunnels, buildings, etc, etc, etc But it's not the actual building that they do (construction crews do that) - they more do work kind of like an architect but more complex - their job is to make sure that what is being built will fit into the environment it is being built in and will be suitable for the purpose it is being built in. Or (quite often) making sure that something that has already been built continues to be fit for it's purpose or can be repaired so that it once again becomes fit for it's purpose. For example: A civil engineer building a road will make sure it will be able to be built for the environment it is in (i.e. it won't crack or subside), that it will be able to handle the amount of traffic it will need, that the construction crew will actually be able to build it, etc, etc. And all of this with a budget about half of what he actually needs. Civil engineers work on systems where the sum of the forces equals zero, i.e. there is *no* net acceleration. For example roads, bridges, dams. Mechanical engineers work on systems where the sum of the forces does not equal zero, i.e. there *is* a net acceleration in some direction. For example cars, trains, turbines, and all the moving subcomponents that make those systems work.

Where does excess power generated by solar panels go?,"When you have more energy than you use, it goes to the grid. When you have less, you get it back from the grid. You can also choose to store the excess energy in a battery for later use, but that's a more expensive option.   you have a lot of solar panels, you can generate a lot of power.   you use all of that power, then you have no problem. But if you don't use it all, then you have a problem. You have to figure out what to do with the excess energy. You can either store it for later use or you can send it back to the grid. When you send it back to the grid, it goes to the next person who needs it. When you store it, you have to pay for it. You can store it in a battery or in a bank. When you want to use it, you have to pay to get it back out of storage. You have to pay for the energy you use and you have to pay for the energy you store. It's a lot cheaper to use energy when you need it than it is to store it. So you want to use it as much as possible.   you have a lot of solar panels, you can generate a lot of power.   you have a lot of power, you can use a lot of energy.  ","I work in a building which is completely off the grid and is not connected to mains electricity lines. We have a row of twelve solar panels on the side of the building which generate electricity by absorbing the Sun's rays. The building's electrical appliances and lights don't use much electricity, so the panels can sometimes generate more electricity than is needed. In a room of the building, conneceted to the solar panels, are four large batteries. These batteries are similar to those you would find in a car but are larger and can store more electricity. The excess electricity not used by the building is pushed into and stored in these batteries. This means we can access that supply of electricity when the Sun is not in the sky or on cloudy days. In the event that the batteries were full and we weren't using any electricity, the solar panels system would stop generating electricity until it was needed again. Solar panels will act as a heater if the power is not used. Similar to how an engine that is not connected to anything will just make heat and noise. The electricity will just be heating up the wires and the panels themselves. It doesn't generate power that it doesn't use. Sunlight displaces electrons in the solar panel. If those electrons can't go anywhere then as each electron is moved there are fewer electrons left behind to move. Meanwhile the abundance of displaced electrons makes moving more electrons more-and-more difficult. Soon the sunlight is not moving any electrons at all. This is the same reason that batteries don't discharge (as fast) when the device they are in is turned off. It's also why your car battery might be _able_ to push ""500 cold-cranking amps"" but it is not normally moving anywhere near that much current. So the sunlight is a mechanical force. And ""voltage"" is ""electromotive force"" (that's the technical name for voltage). If nothing is using that voltage... if no ""current"" is being drawn... then the forces of electricity and sunlight reach equilibrium and the cells do _nothing_. So if your building has the _potential_ to generate twice as much power as it uses... it still only _actually_ generates as much power as it uses, and the extra potential is just meaningless. What normally happens in such a design is that you add batteries to store some energy for darker times, or you hook up to the grid and generate 100% of your potential, use half, and sell the other half to the grid. In other terms, I can reasonably lift fifty pounds, but I rarely lift more than ten. It's improper to ask ""what happened to the other forty pounds"" because they don't exist. That forty pounds didn't ""go anywhere"". It was never there at all. Same for the capacity of the panels to generate XXX current. If you only use the lessor YY current, then that's all that's generated. Same for your house on the grid. The grid _could_ supply enough power to melt your entire house in bright electric arcs. But since you never ask it for that kind of power it never happens. (And we have circuit breakers and fuses that prevent that request being filled if you should have something break and so ask for that kind of power.) So that's why turning off appliances and lights ""saves power"" by eliminating the place where such power might go, and so eliminating its actual production. TL;DR :: Electricity, when it piles up has ""back-pressure"" because that's how ""electrical charge"" works. That back-pressure slows or stops the generation of electricity in solar panels so that only as much as you use can actually be generated.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.37, 'recall': 20.87, 'fmeasure': 30.32}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.86, 'recall': 4.84, 'fmeasure': 7.03}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.62, 'recall': 9.66, 'fmeasure': 14.03}}"
Why does gas you get in the US have so much lower octane numers than in germany?,"Octane rating is a measure of how much energy the fuel can hold before it ignites in the engine. In the US, most cars are designed for low octane fuel. In Europe, most cars are designed for high octane fuel. The octane rating of gasoline is determined by its boiling point. The higher the boiling point, the higher the octane rating. In the US, the standard gasoline has an octane rating of 87, which means that it is designed to burn in engines with a compression ratio of up to 8.7:1. In Europe, the standard gasoline has an octane rating of 95, which means that it is designed to burn in engines with a compression ratio of up to 9.5:1. Higher octane fuel burns more efficiently in high compression engines, and is therefore used in high performance cars. In the US, high octane fuel is not necessary for most cars, so it is not available at most gas stations. In Europe, high octane fuel is required for most cars, so it is available at most gas stations.","Your octane numbers and our octane numbers don't mean the same thing. From an engineering perspective the octane number is actually a kind of hilariously arbitrary number that basically boils down a bunch of different fuel qualities, that all both individually *and* collectively control a fuel's likelihood to knock, all into a single number, and because of that the precise testing for octane numbers changes depending on the body doing the regulation. So it would be entirely possible for two utterly identical batches of fuel to get different octane ratings when tested by different countries. However, our fuels are also slightly different, as Europe is going to have a slightly different set of additives than we get in the US, but that doesn't really account for most of the difference; the differing standards do. It's not. US and Canada uses RON(Research Octane Number)to measure octane while most of the world uses AKI(Anti-Knock Index). 87RON is the same as 90AKI for a reference point. There are different ways of rating octane. The fuel is the same. From Wikipedia: Research Octane Number (RON) The most common type of octane rating worldwide is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine with a variable compression ratio under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane. Motor Octane Number (MON) Another type of octane rating, called Motor Octane Number (MON), is determined at 900 rpm engine speed instead of the 600 rpm for RON.[1] MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, higher engine speed, and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel's knock resistance. Depending on the composition of the fuel, the MON of a modern pump gasoline will be about 8 to 12 octane lower than the RON, but there is no direct link between RON and MON. Pump gasoline specifications typically require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.[citation needed] Anti-Knock Index (AKI) or (R+M)/2 In most countries, including Australia, New Zealand and all of those in Europe,[citation needed] the ""headline"" octane rating shown on the pump is the RON, but in Canada, the United States, Brazil, and some other countries, the headline number is the average of the RON and the MON, called the Anti-Knock Index (AKI), and often written on pumps as (R+M)/2). It may also sometimes be called the Posted Octane Number (PON). Difference between RON, MON, and AKI Because of the 8 to 12 octane number difference between RON and MON noted above, the AKI shown in Canada and the United States is 4 to 6 octane numbers lower than elsewhere in the world for the same fuel. This difference between RON and MON is known as the fuel's Sensitivity,[4] and is not typically published for those countries that use the Anti-Knock Index labelling system. See the table in the following section for a comparison. Observed Road Octane Number (RdON) Another type of octane rating, called Observed Road Octane Number (RdON), is derived from testing gasolines in real world multi-cylinder engines, normally at wide open throttle. It was developed in the 1920s and is still reliable today. The original testing was done in cars on the road but as technology developed the testing was moved to chassis dynamometers with environmental controls to improve consistency.[5] In the US octane is calculated two different ways and then averaged over those calculations (IE (rating1 + rating 2)/2). What this does is show a ""lower"" octane rating for US gas in general compared to EU countries because in Europe they only calculate octane once (no /2). As for WHY we don't make more other octane levels rather than the ""standard"" 87/89/91 is because of cost. Not long ago I could go to *some* gas stations and fill up with 95 octane (Sunoco for example 20 years ago) if I so chose, but those days are long gone because no cars sold in the US require that much octane and nobody wants to spend extra money filling up with more octane than is required. You CAN however go buy cans of octane boost if you choose at pretty much any auto store which advertise up to 101 octane per tank. Octane primarily deals with the ignition pressure of the fuel. Lower octane fuel will self ignite (without a spark) at lower pressure than higher octane fuel. Cars with engines that operate with high compression ratios (mostly turbo charged and otherwise high performance engines) need higher octane fuel so that the gas doesn't pre-ignite and screw up engine timing/efficiency/performance. Because if it pre-ignites the fuel in the cylinder, not all of the gas will burn off, so the exhaust mix is screwed up, which makes the sensors angry, and you use more fuel than you should, and you lose some output power.

How does a firearm with a three round burst know when to stop after its third round?,"A firearm with a three round burst is called an ""auto-loader"" or ""semi-automatic."" It uses the recoil of the gun to cycle the action and load the next round. The first time you pull the trigger, the gun fires one round. The recoil of the gun causes the slide to move back and forth, and then forward again. The forward motion of the slide is what loads the next round into the chamber. The second time you pull the trigger, the gun fires again. The recoil of the gun causes the slide to move back and forth again, and then forward again. The forward motion of the slide is what loads the next round into the chamber. The third time you pull the trigger, the gun fires again. The recoil of the gun causes the slide to move back and forth again, and then forward again. The forward motion of the slide is what loads the next round into the chamber. The slide is then locked back, and the gun is ready to be fired again.","There are a lot of moving parts to explain, and it is difficult through text, but essentially when you pull the trigger a 6 notch cam wheel doesn't allow the trigger to reengage and stop the bolt until the cam wheel has rotated half way around. The reason that it is 6 notches and only rotates half way around is because there are four shallow notches and two deep notches in that wheel. In this order. Deep, shallow, shallow, deep, shallow shallow. When the trigger is resting in the deep notches it doesn't allow the bolt to engage, however when pulled it engages the bolt, firing a round, then the wheel rotates to a shallow notch which does not prevent the bolt from engaging and thus fires the second round, then the wheel rotates to the next shallow notch which again does not prevent the bolt from engaging and thus fires the third round, the wheel then again rotates but this time to the next deep notch which allows the trigger to prevent the bolt from engaging a fourth time. So each three round burst rotates that cam wheel half way around, bringing it to the next deep notch which brings the bolt to rest. There are more moving parts but this is a basic explanation. Anything further would require illustration. Note that this is pretty much the most basic version, generally referred to as the Eugene Stoner. There are many variations as well, some are much much more complicated, especially if the weapon has a fully automatic option as well.

"How is 'memory foam' (I.E. memory foam mattress, pillow) made?","Memory foam is a type of polyurethane foam, which is made by a chemical reaction between a polyol (an alcohol with a hydroxyl group) and a diisocyanate. The reaction is catalyzed by a catalyst, and the mixture is then allowed to foam. The foam is then baked to make it hard.","This is actually more of a chemistry related topic, but essentially foams in pillows/mattresses are created from polyurethane foams. Two major chemicals are used in the polyurethane production and other chemicals are used to adjust the rate of reaction to tweak the final product. The first chemical is some form of isocyanate, if we're talking mattresses then this is a semi-rigid foam and probably uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) in the reaction. The second major chemical is referred to as a ""Polyol"" (essentially this means that it has multiple OH (alcohol) groups on the molecule, meaning that there is a high variance in the type of molecule you can use). A catalyst (typically nitrogen based) is used to initiate a polymerization reaction between the isocyanate group and the alcohol groups. The reaction releases CO2 as a bi-product which produces bubbles and causes the rising of the foam. The presence of the CO2 throughout the foam is what causes the formation of the pores in the foam. The reaction continues until it is finished and cross linking can occur between the polymer chains to increase the rigidity. Like I said, other chemicals come into play such as surfactants, catalysts,etc. which will determine the overall foam product's rigidity, porosity,etc. This is a fairly difficult process to perfect and is actually considered one of the most difficult branches of chemistry. -Source: Worked in a polyurethane foam manufacturing company","{'rouge1': {'precision': 72.55, 'recall': 15.35, 'fmeasure': 25.34}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 24.0, 'recall': 5.0, 'fmeasure': 8.28}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 45.1, 'recall': 9.54, 'fmeasure': 15.75}}"

How Medieval/Ancient large kitchens worked?,"It's important to understand that the ""kitchen"" as we think of it today, a separate room dedicated to food preparation, did not exist until the 16th century. Prior to that, food preparation was a part of the main living area, and cooking was done over an open fire or on a hearth. In a castle, the kitchen would be located in the castle's keep, which was the central part of the castle where the lord and his family lived. The kitchen would be a large room with a fireplace in the center, and the castle's cooks would prepare meals over the fire. Food would be brought in from the castle's farms and gardens, and cooked in a variety of pots and pans. The food would then be served to the lord and his family in the castle's dining hall. The kitchen would also be where the castle's bakers would prepare bread and other baked goods. The castle's brewers would prepare beer and other beverages in the kitchen as well. In the castle's stables, the castle's butchers would slaughter and prepare the castle's meat. The castle's kitchen would be where the castle's cooks would prepare meals for the lord and his family.  ","Well, before the invention of the wheel, you didn't really have civilization, and so no armies. You had maybe warbands. Before the steam engine - there were still mechanical advantage devices. Gearing and waterwheels go back to Ancient Greece at least, and you could tie some mules to a harness and have them walk around in a circle, driving the main wheel. Mills used water or wind power. And yes, a gigantic amount of manpower. For every soldier in an expeditionary force, there were several people doing the background work. But yeah, in those days the scale of war was severely limited by logistics. You've heard ""an army marches on its stomach"", and it was a lot more literal back then. Many of the great campaigns of history were not amazing because of the strategic abilities of the commanders, or the tactical superiority of the troops and their equipment - that played a part, but people would learn from each other's successes - but from the logistical abilities of the army to get food to the front lines. The Romans conquered the known world not because their troops were unbeatable - they certainly suffered defeats in individual battles - but because they built roads, had engineers, and could deliver food, water, construct a functional camp every night. The Mongols conquered the known world not because their troops were unbeatable - they were tactically dominant on the plains, but not in bogs or mountain passes - but because every warrior carried his entire kit on his horse and could forage for himself, so they were not dependent on vulnerable supply trains. Napoleon was defeated in Russia not because the Russians had superior generals (they had a few very good ones, sure) and not because the Russian troops were especially tough (they were fighting on home turf, sure), but because the Russians burned everything in Napoleon's path on the way in, and again on the way out.

"Why do we need so many different types of screw heads? Straight, Phillips, Torx, Square, Hexagon, etc... couldn't we settle on just a few?","I work in IT and I can tell you that it's a lot easier to make a new screw head than it is to make a new screw driver. The screw head is a very small part of the overall screw and there's a lot of room for innovation. Screws have been around for thousands of years and they have been used in countless applications. There's no way you could make a screw that's universally compatible with all of the different screws that have been made. It's just not practical. There are many different screws because they are used for many different applications. Different screws are used for different things. For example, a screw used to hold a computer motherboard together is not the same as a screw used to hold a piece of furniture together. The screws are made differently, because the screws are used in different ways.  rews have to be made to be able to fit into those places. The screws are made differently, because the screws are used for different things. The screws are made differently, because the screws are used in different places. The screws are made differently, because the screws are used for different things.  ","They weren't all introduced at the same time, and therefore have to compete with each-other for market share. Originally there was only flat-head, this is because you can make a flat-head screw and driver very easily. Before there were different types of screws, they called the driver a ""Turnscrew"" Then somebody thought to themselves ""If there were two slots, like an X then the Turnscrew would be a bit harder to make but wouldn't slide out of the screw all the time. (this guys name was probably Phillips, not actually sure though) This idea worked quite well and so there were now two standards. They both co-exist because X is definitely better to work with, but the slot is always going to be cheaper and easier to make. Eventually a third person decided that the way that Phillips pops out if you apply too much torque is sub-optimal, so they came up with Robertson (Square type) This system managed to catch on quite well, but not become very widespread. This type is a little more expensive to make the screws than Phillips, but a little cheaper to make the drivers too. Now we have three competing standards. All of which have their strengths and weaknesses. All of which are able to take a viable slice of the market and compete with each-other. The other standards you've mentioned all came into the market in a similar manner, but I'm telling the story of the big three types because it's way simpler to explain the concept that way. The simplest screw head, the flat head, allows your tool to slide out at the slightest misalignment. Phillips heads solved that problem, but introduced another: the screws strip easily when the driver cams out due to excessive torque. Newer designs have different balances of torque protection, size, manufacturing ease, etc. You also have a bit of this going on: URL_0 There's a lot of reasons, and many other answers have hit the high points. In general, ""sophisticated machinery"" means ""it's more expensive to make."" * ""Flathead"" screws were created first because they're the easiest to make and didn't require sophisticated machinery. * ""Phillips head"" screws were created later because it takes more sophisticated machining to create them. They're easier to screw in than flat heads, but can be subject to ""stripping"" that makes reuse impossible. * They are, by design, subject to a problem called ""cam-out"", that means the screwdriver might slip and stop applying force. In good Phillips screws, this stops you from over-tightening the screws. In cheap Phillips screws, this makes it impossible to properly tighten them without stripping. * ""Robertson"" screws were created to deal with the stripping problems of Phillips heads, but take more sophisticated machinery to create. * Torx and Hex screws are alternate ways to try and address the problems with Phillips heads, and also require sophisticated machinery. (I think it's possible Torx was trademarked * Robertson, Torx, and Hex are more resistant to ""cam-out"". That means you're less likely to strip them, but you can also over-tighten them without a more sophisticated screwdriver designed to prevent over-tightening. * A few other head types exist and are called ""security bits"". The goal here is either to make a screw few people will have a screwdriver to turn, or in some cases make it very difficult to unscrew the screw without causing damage. These are for applications like public restroom stalls, where you don't want vandals to unscrew your screws. Common security bits have tri-wing, square, and triangular heads, but many tighten-only screws have drivers that look sort of like bottle openers. So the reasons so many heads exist are: * Some screws are really cheap to make, and the cheapest possible solution will always exist even if it's very bad. * Some screws were designed to be easier to use than the cheaper ones, but are more expensive and have varying problems with over-tightening or stripping. * Some screws are designed in the hopes that you don't have a screwdriver for them, so you don't mess with them. That's sort of why a lot of car mechanisms use different screws on one part. The manufacturer is trying to make it so the average person with a cheap toolset won't be able to properly disassemble and reassemble the mechanisms. But the licensed, ""qualified"" mechanic's shop will have all of the necessary tools. Don't ask me why they tend to replace all of the screws with inferior, half-broken ones. That probably has to do with the ""cheaper"" reason. Different tools for different jobs. A standard screw is simplest and works will with hand tools. A Phillips screw is good with a machine driver, because it is less likely to slip. A Torx screw is less likely to slip than a Phillips, so it is better when a screw has to be really tight, but it is harder to align initially. A hex screw is good when you are selling assemble yourself furniture and way to provide a single cheap tool that can do all the work. The older ones are simpler to make the screw and the tool. As machining methods have improved we've been able to design more complex screws/drivers to overcome the flaws in the old designs. The old designs are still used because they are very inexpensive to make and there are no licensing fees associated with the design.

how do touch lamps actually work?,"The filament inside a lamp is a wire that is heated to incandescence by the electric current passing through it. The filament is usually made of tungsten. The filament is inside a glass or metal enclosure that is sealed to prevent air getting in and to prevent the filament from breaking. The enclosure is filled with a gas, usually argon or nitrogen. The gas is there to prevent the filament from burning up too quickly and to help the filament maintain its shape. The filament is suspended in the gas by a metal grid. The grid is electrically connected to the filament. When the current flows through the filament it heats up and glows. This produces light. The filament is usually made of a wire that is wound up into a spiral shape. The spiral shape helps to distribute the heat evenly. The filament is also made of a special alloy that is able to withstand the heat.","There's a tiny amount of electricity running through the lamp. When something touches the lamp, a little of that electricity flows into it, changing the current. Different materials cause different changes to the current. Human skin contact causes a pretty predictable change, so if the lamp detects a change that matches human skin, it toggles on/off. Your body is a mediocre capacitor. However, a circuit can charge the outside of the lamp and detect the small current into your body when yu touch the lamp. You leave charged up, but not as much as a winter carpet spark, and the light turns on.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 24.05, 'recall': 36.19, 'fmeasure': 28.9}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.55, 'recall': 3.85, 'fmeasure': 3.07}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.29, 'recall': 20.0, 'fmeasure': 15.97}}"

The first stage of a rocket burns fuel in order to get to a certain height, and then it separates from the rest of the rocket. The second stage then takes over, and so on. The engines on the first stage are designed to burn out quickly, so that the stage falls back to Earth. The engines on the second stage are designed to burn for longer, so that the second stage falls back to Earth more slowly. The third stage is the same, and so on.

","Outside of Las Vegas they are expected to last hundreds of years. Keep in mind most buildings if properly maintained will will last until something catastrophic happens to it or maintanence stops and they decay and become unsafe. Structural Engineer here. The design life of a structure is determined in coordination with the person building it. Whilst having a building that can survive any wind or earthquake event imaginable would be ideal, the trade off is increased construction cost, so normally people go for the minimum allowed, unless the building is needed post disaster. In my country, we typically design for what we call a fifty year design life. For typically buildings, (not hospitals or other important buildings) a fifty year design life relates to a 1/2500 annual probability that a large wind or earthquake event would occur. The longer the design life, the opportunity for a large event becomes more likely, so the structure needs to be come stronger as a result. So in terms of actual structural performance, the structure can survive indefinitely (with maintaince), until the large scale event occurs. The second issue affecting the longevity of a structure is corrosion. Steel obviously rusts over time, so left unintended over time steel will corrode, and eventually break. This can be prolonged with regular maintenance (i.e. Painting or other protective coatings), but eventually the steel will corrode and fail (spectacularly).

How is Geometric Stiffness different to Young's Modulus?,"Young's Modulus is a measure of the elastic stiffness of a material.

It is a measure of the amount of deformation that occurs when the load is held constant.","The basic difference is that Young's Modulus ""E"" is a material property, and the geometric stiffness ""k"" depends on the geometry of the situation as well as the Young's modulus of the material. Specifically, k = E * A/L, where A is the cross-sectional area and L is the length of the specimen. This relationship makes sense physically: if you think of the resistance of a spring to being pulled, a thicker or shorter spring will be more stiff. A spring of the same dimensions will be more stiff when made out of steel than out of rubber because E of steel is much larger than E of rubber.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 50.0, 'recall': 33.33, 'fmeasure': 40.0}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.44, 'recall': 10.91, 'fmeasure': 13.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.78, 'recall': 22.52, 'fmeasure': 27.03}}"

As it turns out, the Earth's core is actually a pretty simple structure. It's divided into two parts: a liquid outer core and a solid inner core. The outer core is divided into two layers. The first layer is called the ""lower outer core"" and it's made up of molten iron and nickel. The second layer is called the ""upper outer core"" and it's made up of molten iron and sulfur. The inner core is made up of a solid iron-nickel alloy that's about 15,000 kilometers (9,300 miles) in diameter. The reason we can tell what the Earth's core looks like is because of the way that seismic waves behave when they pass through the Earth's core.  ","Earthquakes. You know how light bends when it passes from one medium (say, air) to another (water, for example)? Shockwaves do something similar. When there's an earthquake, the shockwaves are detected [in many parts of the world]( URL_0 ). By measuring them carefully, scientists can figure out the path they took and what kind of materials they passed through, allowing them over time to build up a fair model of what's inside the planet. Add to that a lot of other observations, like the existence of a magnetic field, and some basic scientific rules about how different materials behave at different pressures and temperatures, and scientists can make some pretty good guesses as to what the internal structure must be. Geophysics! - The mathematically based study of various physical properties of the Earth. This is then elaborated on with mechanical and chemical lab experiments, and data fed into numerical models to get the best picture of what's down there. In fact, we've had some idea that the Earth's centre had some crazy dense stuff for a long time - Newton's maths of gravity can give us the mass of the Earth. Divide this by the volume and you get the average density of the Earth, which is well outside the range of rock densities seen at the Earth's surface. Even the deep rocks occasionally belched up by volcanoes or exposed in certain places were not dense enough to account for the average density, so it was long hypothesised that a much denser core existed. Fast forward to the second half of the 20th Century and we started to use seismic waves to get an idea of our Earth's structure. This has been the most fruitful method - specifically, timing how long the waves take to travel through various parts of the Earth reveal changes in density (some sharp, some graded), as different materials have different physical properties and so change the speed of wave propagation. The fact some waves do not travel through part of the Earth at all indicates that it is molten - this is the outer core. Shear waves cannot propagate through this liquid outer core as they move via deformation of the medium, and liquids have no rigidity to deform. The global network of seismometers used to detect all this is also used to detect nuclear tests. This network and the computing power used to process data from them has advanced sufficiently to allow a sub-field known as seismic tomography - in which cross sectional images of the Earth's implied density and temperature (which also affects wave speeds) can be produced at a higher resolution than other seismic wave studies, giving a three dimensional view of structures such as rising plumes through the mantle if the cross sections are stacked. The actual composition of the Earth's layers has been determined by observing how various materials behave when subjected to high pressure and temperature experiments in the lab. The graded changes in density occur due to elements getting squished together with increasing pressure in the Earth to form different minerals the deeper you go (but made up of the same elements). The sharp changes in density occur due to a change in the elements that make up that particular layer. Iron fits the bill for the Earth's core as it has to be a metal (to produce the magnetic field), and it also stands up to predictrd density at the relevant temps and pressures. Iron also fits in a cosmic sense - there is a lot of it in the universe due to it being the end result of fusion in stars, and our solar system is no exception - we have iron based meteorites assumed to be fragments of proto-planetary cores from the early solar system.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.57, 'recall': 16.67, 'fmeasure': 26.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.54, 'recall': 5.35, 'fmeasure': 8.41}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.14, 'recall': 8.02, 'fmeasure': 12.58}}"

Why does SpaceX land their rocket on a barge on the ocean?," In order to land the rocket on land, the rocket would have to be slowed down and descended to the ground. This would require a lot of energy and would make the rocket very heavy. Because of this, the rocket would not be able to take off again and would be useless. On the other hand, the rocket could be slowed down and descended to the ocean without using a lot of energy. From there, the rocket could be used again. This is why SpaceX uses a barge on the ocean to land their rockets.","Because landing on land limits the places you can take off from and the direction you can point your rocket. I believe the first successful test of the rockets did have them go on land, but the goal is to let the rockets take off in the most efficient places to put their payloads into orbit. If that means taking off over the ocean, then they need to have a landing spot on the ocean. It primarily has to do with fuel. To get back to land, the first stage must burn more fuel to do an about face. This is fuel it doesn't have to spare if it needs to get the satellite to geostationary (a higher) orbit. Therefore it is easier to just 'keep going' in a parabola shape and land in the ocean. For low earth orbit, like ISS resupply missions, it has enough fuel to do that extra burn and return to land. Your launchpad is in Florida, and your launching eastward. There happens to be a big ocean eastward of Cape Canaveral. Nowhere for you to land on. If you flew all the way back to the launchpad, that means you have to carry more fuel. If you just turn and execute a burn to eliminate forward momentum, that gets you to drop straight down and land on a barge in middle of ocean.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 51.58, 'recall': 21.3, 'fmeasure': 30.15}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.89, 'recall': 6.11, 'fmeasure': 8.67}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.32, 'recall': 10.87, 'fmeasure': 15.38}}"
Technical debt,"is the cost of taking shortcuts in software development. (In the same way that financial debt is the cost of borrowing money). A software developer may choose to cut corners in order to meet a deadline or to save money. For example, they may not write automated tests for a new feature, or they may use a less efficient algorithm. This can make the software easier to develop, but it also makes it harder to maintain and debug later on. When a developer has to fix bugs or add new features to a software program, they may need to go back and rewrite code. This can be time consuming and expensive. If the code is well written, it's easy to understand and fix. If the code is poorly written, it's hard to understand and fix. This is why it's important to write clean, well-documented code. It's also why it's important to avoid taking shortcuts. If you're working on a software program and you have a deadline to meet, it's tempting to cut corners. However, this can lead to problems down the road. The software may be less reliable, and it may be harder to maintain. It's better to take your time and do things right the first time. When you're working on a software program, it's important to think about the long-term.  ","Technical debt is the software engineering buzzword for taking shortcuts that come back to bite you later. Now, maybe you *had* to take a shortcut to launch your thing on time, or maybe you're just a lazy POS. In my experience in software, it's a 50/50 mix. Here are some possible types of technical debt (not an exhaustive list): * Lack of tests. This is important for projects with large teams because the original author of some code isn't necessarily going to be there to review changes from other team members. The reason this is debt is because future well-intentioned changes could cause a regression in behavior, which will waste significantly more time with rolling back builds, finding culprit changelists, rolling back code (or fixing forward, not recommended 99% of the time), finding the bug, and rolling forward. * Poor encapsulation. Encapsulation is the idea that a chunk of code should be mostly self-contained, with anything not self-contained being established and documented. Think of it like an electrical system in a house: External influences are well documented (different plug types), the main logic lives in one spot (breaker box). However, let's now imagine that, because it was easier to do at the time and it saved construction time (somehow), the only way to reset your breaker box is to flush your toilet. This would be an example of poor encapsulation. (Now let's say you had to replace your toilet, and... oh no, you have to completely unwind your electrical system to be able to get at the toilet. Looks like a weekend project just became a 2 week project.) * Hacks. A hack is a form of a shortcut taken because it's trivially easy to do, even if not a great idea. [Here is an example of a hack outside of software.]( URL_0 ) This could be a fairly well-contained hack (like say calling a function that hits your server infinitely until it works instead of backing off if you detect an outage, since you just have to delete that one chunk of code and rewrite it), or it could be systemic (""If I just give the whole application access to these bytes, it will be way easier to set them from all over the application,"" now you have to rewrite your whole application to fix it). Hacks are incredibly insidious in code, and often lead to more hacks. If a hack is fixed right away, then the cost of the hack was the time spent adding the hack plus the time spent doing it right. Often times, laziness or downward pressure from leadership results in people adding more hacks to work around existing hacks. If you wait long enough for more code to depend on the hack, now you have to spend the time to redo everything around it right, in addition to the spent doing the original thing right. I've seen many projects at my place of employment slowly die due to accruing technical debt. As it grows, your ability to get work done in a timely manner shrinks, until you're spending 3 months getting something done that should have taken a week at most. It's a common agile software term. When you start making part of a program before other parts, you do work (spend $) and you get a part of the software. Let's say it's 1/2 of the software. Later on, when you're figuring out the next chunk of software, you notice that 10% of the code you already made has to be redone. This ""technical debt"" of 5% of your project is a debt you took on (perhaps without intending to) when you implemented the first half of the code.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.11, 'recall': 22.7, 'fmeasure': 33.1}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.02, 'recall': 5.56, 'fmeasure': 8.12}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.35, 'recall': 10.16, 'fmeasure': 14.81}}"

Why [in the US] is electricity run by private corporations?,"dont know if this is a question that has a good answer, but ill give it a shot. In the US, the government was created to have a limited role in the economy. It was created to protect individual rights and property, and to provide a common defense. It was not created to be an active participant in the economy. The government was created to provide a framework for the economy, and to protect the rights of individuals. The private sector is better at providing electricity than the government, because it is more efficient. The government is more efficient at providing things that are hard to privatize, like defense.   at providing things that are hard to regulate, like the national highways.   at providing things that are hard to fund, like the space program.   at providing things that are hard to fund, like the space program.   at providing things that are hard to regulate, like the national highways.   at providing things that are hard to privatize, like defense.   at providing things that are hard to provide, like defense.   at providing things that are hard to provide, like defense.   at providing things that are hard to provide, like defense.   at providing things that are hard to provide, like defense.  ","Lots of states allow for a company to own what is essentially a monopoly on a utility in exchange for the government having tight reins on the prices that the utility can charge. The advantage to having a private company running the utility is that they have more incentive than the government to run efficiently. If the management of a utility can cut costs by 5%, the company gets extra profit to invest in new business, and the management personally gets more money. If a government body cut costs by 5%, then that money goes to the government and the organization typically doesn't see any of it. There's less incentive to fire people who do poor work or find new ways to save the customer money because there is no extra profit to be made. It's worth mentioning that utility companies typically don't have a lot of margin. They're often considered ""old lady"" stocks because, although they reliably make a return on investment and seldom crash, they're almost never going to see the growth that a non-utility stock can. As a result, the long-term return on investment tends to be a bit low. Let's say you and your school buddies want a new swing set for the playground. But even if all of you saved every penny of your milk money, you'd never be able to afford one. So instead, you go to the swingset guy and say ""if you build is a swingset, we'll pay you out of our milk money to use it."" Well the swingset guy doesn't think this is a very good deal. After all, if you can't afford to build one yourself, he's not going to make his money back for a very long time. So you make a deal, he'll build the swingset, but no one else is allowed to build any playground equipment until he has made back all of his money. Well now that's not a very good deal for you. With no other playground equipment, he can charge whatever he likes for access to the swings.

The reason we can say this is because the way current *actually* works in that you get a buildup of electrons. If you just have a battery with a wire attached to one end, the electrons push out to the end of the wire, but then have nowhere to go, and all the electrons behind them get backed up like a traffic jam. If you connect that wire to the other end of the battery, then the electrons can move forever, since always moving ""forward"" will be possible in a loop. Grounding stuff breaks this ""rule"" because of what an electron ground is. Electrical grounds are basically giant empty spaces where electrons can funnel in. They *can* move in because there is effectively always space for them, whereas on something like a thin copper wire they run out of room really really quickly.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 27.54, 'recall': 28.22, 'fmeasure': 27.88}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.01, 'recall': 3.09, 'fmeasure': 3.05}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.57, 'recall': 15.95, 'fmeasure': 15.76}}"
911 planes. If the two planes that hit the twin towers did not go through either buildings. How come the plane that hit the pentagon went through 3 structures (6 concrete walls?,"There are two main reasons. First, the plane that hit the Pentagon was a commercial airliner, and not a military aircraft. As such, it was designed to carry a certain number of passengers and a certain amount of fuel, and it was not designed to carry a large amount of armor or explosives.   Pentagon was a Boeing 757-200, and it had a maximum takeoff weight of 550,000 pounds, and a maximum fuel weight of 100,000 pounds.   World Trade Center was a Boeing 767-200, and it had a maximum takeoff weight of 545,000 pounds, and a maximum fuel weight of 125,000 pounds. So the plane that hit the Pentagon was heavier than the plane that hit the World Trade Center, and it was designed to carry more fuel, which means it was designed to be able to fly for a longer distance. Second, the plane that hit the Pentagon was flying at a much higher altitude than the plane that hit the World Trade Center.   Pentagon was flying at an altitude of 29,000 feet, and it was traveling at a speed of about 560 miles per hour.  ","Steel is stronger than concrete.

"Is an electric shock safer to withstand while wearing shoes, standing on solid ground - or safer if standing knee deep in the water/river?","It depends on the voltage and the resistance of the water. If the water is a very good conductor, like salt water, then it will be safer to be in the water. If it is a poor conductor, like fresh water, then it will be safer to be standing on the ground. The water will not conduct the electricity as well as the ground will, so the electricity will be less dangerous. The reason it is safer to be in the water is because the water is a much better conductor of electricity than the ground. This is why lightning strikes often hit water. Water is a better conductor of electricity than the ground. The ground is better at carrying electricity than water because the water is not in contact with the ground. If the water is in contact with the ground, then the water and the ground are able to conduct electricity together.",The former is better if we are talking about limiting the current going to ground through you in a situation like touching a live wire with only one hand. If you are actually well insulated from ground no current will flow and you won't get shocked; lineman servicing power lines can touch wires at many kV because they take all the precautions to remain insulated from ground and obviouly avoid touching at the same time the neutral conductor (which is also normally referenced to ground). If however you touch a live wire with one hand and offer a path to neutral/ground with the other it doen't really matter where you are standing or what you are wearing because the current path will be from hand to hand through your torso.

"When ships get 'sold for scrap', how exactly are they broken up into spare parts?","I work in the scrap industry, and I can tell you that the process is pretty much the same as it has been for the past 100 years.

Once the pieces are cut, the metal is melted down in a furnace to remove any impurities. The metal is then melted down again to the desired thickness, and it is then rolled into the desired shape. Once the metal has been rolled, it is then cut into the desired size, and it is then used to make the various parts that are needed.

"If horsepower is calculated from torque (and RPM), then why do some engines have more horsepower than torque while some other engines have less horsepower than torque?"," tl;dr - There are no engines that have more horsepower than torque. But there are engines that have more torque than horsepower. So why do some engines have more horsepower than torque, and why do some engines have more torque than horsepower? Well, let's start with the basics. Torque is a measure of how hard something is working. In this case, torque is how hard an engine is working. The more torque an engine makes, the more work it can do. Horsepower is a measure of how fast that work is happening. The more horsepower an engine makes, the faster that work is happening. So, if an engine makes 500 horsepower, that means it's working 500 times harder than an engine that makes 1 horsepower. That's a lot of work. Torque is measured in pounds-feet, and horsepower is measured in watts. That's a lot of math. But the important thing is that torque and horsepower are related to each other. If an engine makes more torque, it will make more horsepower. And if an engine makes more horsepower, it will make more torque. But there are some things that can make an engine make more torque than horsepower.  ","The formula for calculating horsepower is HP = Torque x RPM / 5,252. That means at 5,252 RPM, horsepower = torque as measured in lb-ft. However, the amount of torque being produced will be different at different engine speeds. If an engine makes the most torque at a high RPM (i.e. a motorcycle engine,) the resulting peak horsepower calculation will be high. If the engine makes the most torque at a low RPM (i.e. a semi truck engine,) the peak horsepower will be much lower than the peak torque.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 19.21, 'recall': 42.86, 'fmeasure': 26.53}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.46, 'recall': 10.0, 'fmeasure': 6.16}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 12.32, 'recall': 27.47, 'fmeasure': 17.01}}"

","I'm not an architect or civil engineer, but I have lived in many places and in my experience home ventilation systems are more related to the climate of the area that the building is in. For example, all the new constructions I saw in North Dakota had vents in the floor; whereas in Phoenix, where I currently live, most new homes have the vents in the ceiling. In North Dakota, the AC will almost never be used, however heating is used 8-9 months out of the year. Since hot air rises, you want the vents in the floor. In Phoenix, the heat is never used, but AC is running about 6-7 months of the year. Since cold air sinks, you want the vents in the ceiling. Also, as the other person said, the architecture also comes into play. I doubt you will ever see floor mounted vents in a basement or industrial building. This is because the foundation is going to be several feet of solid concrete. And good luck running ducting through that. When you look up in an industrial building, like a supermarket or office tower, you are not actually seeing the ceiling. There is many feet above the false ceiling you see that is used for ducting and wiring. In these applications, venting from the ceiling is a matter of practicality. You could conceivably run ducting down through the wall and vent at the bottom of the wall, but that would be an unnecessary cost and no sane building owner would pay for that.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 32.02, 'recall': 28.08, 'fmeasure': 29.92}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.29, 'recall': 4.63, 'fmeasure': 4.94}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 16.67, 'recall': 14.62, 'fmeasure': 15.57}}"

"Why hasn't the Flint, MI water issue been fixed?","It has been fixed. The water is safe to drink now. The problem is that it is a small city in a poor state and they don't have the money to replace all of the lead pipes. The lead pipes are the problem. The water is clean, but the pipes are not. They are old and corroded and contain lead. The water is clean, but the pipes are not. The lead pipes are not just in Flint. They are in many cities across the country. The problem is that they are old and corroded and contain lead. The pipes are being replaced, but it is a slow process.","To really understand the answer to that, you have to understand what went wrong in the first place. The city, decades ago, used cheaper lead piping for much of the city's water supply. That in and of itself *sounds* terrible but is actually not so bad: the lead doesn't corrode into the water easily, and the pipes were treated to prevent that. It's something that *could* be a problem if mishandled but is not necessarily a problem by itself. The mishandling came when the city council opted to get water from the local Flint River instead of being supplied by Lake Huron via Detroit like they were. The water in Flint River was significantly more acidic and had naturally occurring chemicals that corrode piping. Again, sounds terrible but as long as you don't have lead piping, it's not a big deal. Except, of course, Flint *does* use a lot of lead piping. This could have been avoided anyway if the water had been treated properly to prevent the corrosion, but it was not. That corrosion is what caused the huge spike in lead found in the water. The pipes lost their protective coating and began corroding, which dumped all the corroded lead directly into the water. *There is no fixing that*. Flint had long since switched back to getting their water through Detroit, but the damage was done. Once the pipes started corroding, you can't go back and fix it. It's like getting a scratch in the paint in your car and the metal starts rusting, and the rust starts seeping under undamaged paint and causing it to flake off, which causes more rust. Except your car is underground and you don't know where it is. Fixing the pipes means replacing the pipes, and for the most part, *no one knows where the pipes are*. They have a general area, sure, but the plans for exactly where the pipes were laid were made decades ago and a lot of them were lost or never updated with new construction. No one is sure which pipes are made of lead and need to be replaced and which aren't. That means tearing through roads, sidewalks, and property to dig up (and probably damaging) a lot of perfectly good piping to find and replace all the bad lead pipes that have to get fixed. [It's going to be expensive]( URL_1 ), [maybe exorbitantly expensive]( URL_0 ). Flint was never a rich town to begin with. That's what caused this crisis in the first place: the city council trying to save money on water. After the crisis, the people who could afford to leave have almost certainly all left, leaving mostly people who *can't* afford to leave. Think about what that means: they don't have enough money to leave the place where their drinking water is literally poisoning them. The city simply doesn't have the money to fix it. And it's not like their neighbor Detroit is doing well enough to give them money - and it wouldn't be a loan, Flint can't afford to pay back a loan anymore than they can afford to pay for it themselves. There is no quick or easy fix for it unfortunately. The incorrectly treated water created a corrosion problem in the pipes of the city, causing them all to leach lead into the water system. Without a top to bottom overhaul of the entire cities water lines, the problem can't be fixed. That will take approximately a decade, and will cost millions if not billions of dollars. The damage was already done when they let the corrosive water into the system. That stripped away protection preventing lead from leaching into the water from old piping systems. They did switch back to Detroit water almost as soon as the issue was noticed, but that doesn't replace the protective mineral layer around the pipes. To fix it ""tomorrow"" would be to spend a billion dollars pulling out and replacing literally every pipe within the city water system. You need to pay a team of engineers to redesign the pipes to modern standards, purchase the actual pipe, pay a crew to install it, and also pay homeowners for destroying their front/backyards. This project will take years. The only other alternative is to simply keep running water through the system to allow the mineral layer to build back up. Eventually the old pipes will be OK, and lead levels will go below EPA levels. This process will also take years. Unfortunately, Flint isn't exactly a booming industrial town as it was a few decades ago. Their electorate voted for a city administration that promised to cut costs no matter what, which included switching water supplies. Yes, this was a fantastically bad call, as they saved more money by not paying for engineering studies that would have said as much. They also ignored their city water engineers who said it was a bad call. Those officials are being punished in due course. While we'll all feel super bad for them, it's tough to justify kicking out a billion dollars on their water system instead of 50 new schools literally anywhere else. They'd stand a better chance at getting credit to move out of Flint and relocate, as that would cost the taxpayers millions instead of billions.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 79.82, 'recall': 9.59, 'fmeasure': 17.13}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 25.0, 'recall': 2.98, 'fmeasure': 5.33}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 51.38, 'recall': 6.17, 'fmeasure': 11.02}}"

How does an AA gun or a flak gun work?,"FlaK guns are anti-aircraft guns. They are designed to shoot high velocity rounds at very low angles of attack. They are not designed to be very accurate at long ranges, but they are very good at shooting at low flying aircraft. This is because the rounds are designed to be very aerodynamic and to be able to penetrate armor. The rounds are launched from the gun at high velocity and the aerodynamic shape of the round allows it to be steered in flight. This allows the gun to hit aircraft that are flying low and slow. They are very fast because they are designed to be very light. The light weight allows them to be accelerated to high speeds. They are also very short barreled, which allows them to be accelerated to high speeds without the need for a large barrel.","Early models of flak shells had what /u/_YourPariah_ had. You figured out the altitude of the aircraft, then adjusted the timer on the shell to explode at the appropriate height. During the Second World War, the US and UK developed the Proximity Fuse, which worked like u/fofwalker says. Those shells detected an aircraft nearby and exploded. The new fuse was so secret, it was forbidden to use them on the continent for fear the Germans would get their hands on them. URL_0 I believe there's a timer in the rounds. Since you know how fast the round travels, it's pretty easy to calculate X number of seconds equals y number of feet in the air. I'm no expert but I always thought that they had little radar devices inside of the rounds that would explode into shrapnel when near an airplane. *I'm assuming you're talking about large calibre flak (such as the 8.8cm) and not lower calibre anti-aircraft guns that work the same as normal guns.* Flak shells in WW2 had 2 types of fuses, either a timed fuse or a barometric fuse. The timed fuse is pretty self explanatory and detonates when the timer expired. The barometric fuse on the other hand detonated when a certain (set) altitude was reached. Timed fuzes, mostly. They generally knew what altitude the planes they were shooting at were flying, and how long it took for their rounds to reach that altitude, so they set a timer. The Allies also had proximity fuzes. They were essentially tiny radars that would detonate the shell when it got close. Very important to the war effort, almost on par with the atomic bomb. The shells they are firing up at the planes have an adjustable fuse that can be set before firing to explode at different altitudes. The idea is to saturate the area around the planes with shrapnel and hope it hits the airmen, or something vital in the plane. Hitting a moving target with a purely ballistic trajectory is incredibly hard and timed explosions help even the odds.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 42.96, 'recall': 17.23, 'fmeasure': 24.6}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.67, 'recall': 2.27, 'fmeasure': 3.24}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.13, 'recall': 8.47, 'fmeasure': 12.1}}"

The radiator is often used to heat the room, but the window is used to let in light.

And to get the cold corner to a nice temperature you'd have to make the warm part of the room even warmer. Putting the radiator at the window leads to a more evenly distributed warmth in a room. There are many reasons why. As said already, it helps with the heat distribution of the room by creating a warm buffer near the window to help minimize heat loss. This pocket of warm air insulates the rest of the room from drafts coming from the outside. It also helps decrease the amount of condensation on the window by keeping it warm enough to not reach the dew point. Space is also something to consider.

How effective was the Great Wall of China at keeping Mongolians out of China?,"It was a huge wall, but it was not made of steel or concrete or anything like that. It was made of stone.

It was pretty easy for nomads to raid Chinese farming villages in the north with just a few men. The wall was someone effective in deterring that because it's hard to destroy a wall with a very small force and it only takes a couple people on a wall to fight you off. When it came to large invasions, the wall's main purpose was to provide warning and maybe slow invaders. In fact, the wall has signal towers all along it so that a warning could be sent to wherever it needed to go. The wall was too big to man with a large, permanent force that could repel an invading army, but an invading army would still either have to spend time getting through the wall or around the wall. While they were doing that, the warning signal would be making its way to the capital and/or army. [This]( URL_0 ) thread from /r/askhistorians goes into some pretty good detail. I've been to the Wall and the story they give is that the smoke signals from the towers were the best defense, as mentioned earlier. Interestingly many locals will tell you that it was also built to deter evil spirits coming in from Mongolia as spirits naturally move upwards and so building a wall across the mountain tops would help to block that bad energy from entering China. The original wall wasn't built to keep the Mongolians out - they wouldn't be united until 1200AD by Ghengis Khan. It was built mainly around 200BC to keep the XiongNu out. The XiongNu were Asiatic Huns and consisted of small tribes of nomadic peoples. Not too much is known about them because they didn't leave much archaeological evidence and it was very early in China's history, so Chinese historical accounts weren't too reliable. The Great Wall is actually relatively close to Beijing - about 100km away (the part designed to protect Beijing and vicinity). From the Great Wall, you can see the skyscrapers of Beijing on an unpolluted day, and you could probably see signal fires on the Great Wall before modern light pollution and tall buildings got in the way. My totally uninformed opinion is that the Mongolians were know to be horse riding invaders. Horses would be difficult to get over the wall, so it would work pretty well at repelling them in large numbers. A ladder could get individuals over it, but if you're used to fighting on a horse you'll be at a disadvantage without your horse... You will probably get a better answer at /r/askhistorians. In fact, you should try searching there to see if it's been asked already.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 48.43, 'recall': 25.62, 'fmeasure': 33.51}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.09, 'recall': 4.8, 'fmeasure': 6.28}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.69, 'recall': 10.42, 'fmeasure': 13.62}}"

","Consider 'building' a wall to be three parts: 1) building walls and gates in major populated areas. This part would be straightforward. It would cost money and take time, but nothing about it is revolutionary. We even have some fences/walls up already that could be used as templates. 2) building walls and gates in 'unpopulated' areas. These include large farmland, sparse grazing areas, national park/forest land, and otherwise inaccessible areas. This would be the most expensive part of the construction effort. A wall that makes sense to build in a dense city will take a massive logistics effort and cost to build in the middle of nowhere. Concrete mixers, roads, power, camps for workers, would all need to be build along the construction zone. While possible, it would be a monumental effort. We have some current surveillance efforts in these areas, but it's mostly a 'when we can get to it' level of effort. 3) continued maintenance. If it does end up getting built, the wall will leave a large bill to future presidents and society for upkeep and guards. One of the main reasons the Great Wall of China was eventually abandoned wasn't the construction cost, but the cost of keeping thousands of troops in the middle of (literally) nowhere to defend the entire stretch. Supplies, transportation, entertainment would all need to be provided to guards on those stretches. As soon as society decides that the cost of maintenance is too expensive, the wall will almost immediately be compromised. Feasible, yes. Useful, hardly. & nbsp; * A large percentage of illegal immigrants exist due to overstaying their Visas. * Tunnels. * Unless you build it high enough, it can be flown over while still being under the radar. * A lot of illegal immigrants simply fly in on commercial flights. Some get caught, some don't. * The Gulf of Mexico exists. * The Pacific Ocean exists. & nbsp; A wall is more of a physical manifestation of Trump's foreign policy than actually being useful for keeping out illegal immigrants. It will create some jobs both short and long term...jobs that will likely be undertaken by immigrants, like most construction/maintenance/border patrol work. Feasible and possible, yes. We could even do it without manufacturing capacity or power equipment. For example, see China. For a more modern example, see Cold War Berlin. The real question is...will it actually accomplish anything other than costing a f*ton of money and making Trump feel a little more masculine? Spoiler alert: almost certainly not. It's entirely possible to build it; it's just a wall. The question is inherently about whether or not it's worth it, particularly considering most illegal immigrants will bypass it entirely by coming into the country through legal means and then simply not leaving. A concrete wall and a concrete road are almost the same thing, with a 90˚ rotation. There are thousands of miles of roads in the Southwest US. Making concrete panels is easy, drilling foundation holes and filling them with concrete is easy, pouring posts on the foundations is easy, slotting the panels in between the posts is easy. The US has many hundreds of miles of sound control wall beside the road that's been made with this process. It will take money, and time, and concrete, and machines. There are some rugged places where it will take some engineering, but that's a starter project for new civil engineering grads. The Rio Grande river has to pass through the wall, and it's very large in that area. This will not be an easy place to build a wall. Serious engineering is required, but not Hoover Dam engineering. The ""will it be worth the money"" question isn't an engineering question. Feasible? Sure. There are approximately 2000 miles of border and currently approximately 700 miles of ""wall"". What's another 1300 miles with enough resources to pay for and do the work? One thing that also needs to be considered is animal habitats and migrations. Animals don't pay attention to national borders so putting up a wall will restrict their movement a lot. I don't know if Trump will care (probably not given his actions regarding the EPA) but if the wall were to be built, figuring out how to make sure animals aren't badly affected would certainly add to the complexity. We aren't talking about a suspension bridge or a very tall tower or something difficult. We're talking about a wall. Walls are very easy to build. It does not need to be a specialized design. It just needs to be a wall that cannot be climbed. Like the peace barriers in Northern Ireland, or the West Bank wall in Israel, or the walls around prisons all around the world. It will be expensive, because it's a lot of wall. But it's not a complex technical structure. There was a great post earlier today by a structural engineer that estimated it would need 3x the concrete used to build the Hoover Dam, and 6x the steel required to build an aircraft carrier. Not to mention the labor and overhead costs to build something that is by and large in the middle of the dessert.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 66.25, 'recall': 12.05, 'fmeasure': 20.38}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.84, 'recall': 2.5, 'fmeasure': 4.24}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 40.0, 'recall': 7.27, 'fmeasure': 12.31}}"

Designing a vehicle requires compromises between these factors. * **Emissions Standards**: Fuel emission standards need to be pretty universal. For example, Los Angeles is affected a lot more by high emissions than Denver, so car manufacturers abide by policies that lower emissions universally for the sake of L.A., even if it reduces fuel efficiency. It's an intertwining of politics and economics. For those who might be confused as to why fuel efficiency isn't always correlated to emissions: depending on several factors, an engine can emit different levels of various particulates, some of which are really damaging to the environment and public health.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 19.77, 'recall': 12.88, 'fmeasure': 15.6}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.18, 'recall': 0.76, 'fmeasure': 0.93}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.95, 'recall': 9.09, 'fmeasure': 11.01}}"
How do missiles like iron dome chase their target?,Missiles are guided by a seeker head that is designed to home in on a specific frequency of radar or infrared light. The seeker head is designed to detect the frequency of the target's radar or infrared emissions and then use that information to adjust the missile's flight path. This is done by adjusting the angle of the seeker head so that it is pointing directly at the target. This is done by adjusting the angle of the seeker head so that it is pointing directly at the target.,"Missiles have four common methods of tracking Active: Missile has an onboard radar and uses it to track the target after launch (more advanced aircraft missiles and surface to air missiles have these) Semi active: Missile has an onboard radar and is receiving information from the ground radar as it's signal is bouncing off the target Semi active ground guidance: missile and radar both track the target, ground station makes final decision on what and where the target it Passive: IR and TV missiles track heat and changes/differences therein to find the target However, that was all extra stuff lol. I think the Iron Dome uses proportional navigation. Like the previous comment, it triangulates where the ground is, where it is, and were the the target is going to be and makes adjustments every few seconds. Since missiles don't react to threats (how would it see them) this is an effective counter missile guidance method. Unlike in anime, sci fi, and action movies, missiles do not ""chase"" their targets. They use sensors and math to predict the path of their target, and go to the point where their path intercepts the target path. They are also generally designed that when they get to the intercept point and explode, that they do not have to make a direct hit. What they do is throw enough shrapnel to destroy anything within a certain radius of the warhead.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 50.55, 'recall': 19.33, 'fmeasure': 27.96}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.67, 'recall': 2.53, 'fmeasure': 3.67}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.67, 'recall': 11.34, 'fmeasure': 16.41}}"
How are we able to shift from reverse to drive in a car while slowly moving backwards without damaging the shifter/gearbox or without the axels locking up?,"A car's transmission is a complex piece of machinery that is designed to be able to shift gears very smoothly and rapidly. It's not the gears themselves that are damaged, but the bearings and the lubrication of the transmission. When you are driving forward, the gears are constantly moving and the bearings are lubricated with oil. When you shift into reverse, the gears are locked into place, and the bearings are not moving. The transmission is designed to handle this and it's lubrication system is designed to keep the bearings lubricated. In order to shift into reverse, the car's transmission is designed to use a different lubrication system, and the bearings are designed to handle this. The bearings are able to handle this because they are able to move slightly when the car is in reverse. This is because the bearings are not locked into place, so they are able to move slightly. This is what allows the car to move backwards. The bearings are able to move slightly because they are lubricated with oil, and the oil is able to move slightly. The oil is able to move slightly because it is under pressure from the transmission. This pressure is created by the transmission's lubrication system.  ","Synchromesh dog collars. It's a little part inside the transmission that resists you pushing the gears together when they are not aligned. The feedback lets you snap the gear into place without damage. In an automatic transmission, there's also a torque converter serving the role of the clutch in a regular transmission. TL;DR: Because it's engineered to work that way. Both the clutch disk (in a manual) and torque converter (auto) allow slippage between the engine shaft and the wheels as part of normal operation. The clutch is easiest to visualize, think of two flat plates pressed together, each with sandpaper on them. Whenever you are starting to move the engine plate is spinning but the one connected to the wheels is not. As they are pressed closer together (by letting up on the clutch pedal), the spinning one rubs against the other one until it is also spinning and now you are driving forward. When you are backing up and then going forward, the only difference is they are initially spinning in opposite directions but the friction will cause the disc to slow, stop, and then spin in the other direction. The torque converter serves a similar purpose int he automatic gearbox.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 37.26, 'recall': 38.16, 'fmeasure': 37.71}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.48, 'recall': 9.71, 'fmeasure': 9.59}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.7, 'recall': 22.22, 'fmeasure': 21.96}}"

What is the purpose of drywall? Why is it used rather than wood?

This is a common feature in many organic compounds, and it is often found in molecules that are important to the functioning of living organisms. In this case, heteroaromat is a molecule that is found in the cells of plants. It is involved in the synthesis of other molecules, and it plays a role in the formation of plant cell walls. Plants are able to build their cell walls by using a variety of different molecules, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. These molecules are all made up of long chains of sugars, and they are bonded together by complex networks of chemical bonds. The cell walls of plants are very strong and flexible, and they help to support the plant and protect it from damage. In addition to these molecules, plants also use a number of other substances to build their cell walls. These include proteins, lignin, and waxes, which are all important to the structure and function of the plant. Heteroaromat is an important part of the plant cell wall, and it is involved in the synthesis of other molecules that are important to plant growth and development.  ","Drywall engineer here! (yes we exist) Many of the answers in the thread are correct, but one of the big reasons everyone is missing is the fire rating of drywall. Drywall is made of gypsum, a hydrated form of calcium sulfate. When the gypsum is exposed to heat, the crystalline water begins to calcine off. This reaction consumes a TON of energy, and prevents fire from spreading across the sheet for considerable time. You can aim a flamethrower at one side of a typical 1/2"" sheet of drywall, and the opposite side of the sheet won't rise above 220F for about 30 mins. Hopefully the fire department has arrived by then. Feel free to ask more questions, I find pleasure in explaining this kind of stuff! Edit-to kill some misconceptions, I work in capital projects engineering for a drywall manufacturer. ""Drywall engineer"" doesn't exist, and would be way too general of a field! Wood houses are built using wood skeletal frames, the ""bones"" of these houses are studs. They provide sufficient structural support to keep the building standing and intact for decades, even centuries. You dont need to build housed out of solid wood, as it would just be unnecessarily expensive. Drywall replaced [lath and plaster]( URL_0 ). lath are thin wood planks that would be nailed to the studs in ceilings and interior walls. They don't provide structural support, they just create a flat surface between the studs, which would then be plastered. This was a multistep process that took several days to complete a room. Drywall, on the other hand, prefabricates the walls, ready to install. Just nail the sheet to the wall and you're basically done. Experienced drywallers can do i ln a day what lath and plaster-ers could do in a week, while offering a comparable result. This dramatically cut down construction time, required less labor, and thus saved money, so it was widely adopted. drywall is cheap, versatile, easy to work with, consistent and fire resistant. The space between walls in the interior is used for sound proofing, and running services like electricity, plumbing, drainage and heating. All of the other comments are fine but I need to add that a major reason is it used more than wood is that drywall is extremely flame resistant compared to wood. I live in the UK. The majority of our houses are not made using drywall/frames. Mostly from a durability point of view and our climate being very damp also. We use concrete/mix foundations with brick construction for exterior and interior walls. Some new builds have drywall put in for minor separating walls but these don't get used without joists usually because of the weights involved in brick built houses. My understanding of American style drywall construction is the gaps between the sides are a form of insulation by trapping air in the space. It's also useful for hiding wiring/pipes etc and means it can be repaired easier without having to replace both sides. Wood isn't used for the walls from an expense point of view. They could use cheap fibre board but it's not durable. Everyone seems to be ignoring your other questions. Walls have a surprising amount of stuff in them. Ductwork, wiring, plumbing, and insulation. If you made walls thinner it can be difficult to run all of this stuff. Also if you used less wood inside the wall it would be more flexible and wobbly. Some walls are actually framed thicker to accommodate for larger pipes. The wall behind a toilet is typically framed with 2x6s rather than 2x4s because the main plumbing stack is very large. As a fellow engineer, your first line and my first line reminds me of a joke......how do you know if the person you are talking to is an engineer? Don't worry, they will tell you. Buildings began as solid wall construction using logs or stone to as the structure, and a bonding agent to fill the gaps and add structure. But solid walls require a lot of heavy material and they don't insulate temperature or sound well, and it takes a tremendous effort. Also, every house was constructed individually so logs were hand shaped on site, and stone was assembled based on the available materials. When the hollow wall came into practice, precut (milled) lumber could be used as the 'bones' of a home dramatically reducing the work time, weight, and variations due to materials. With just the bones in place, the walls needed to be covered. For a long time, small, rough thin boards were used (lathe) to cover the walls, then a layer of plaster was applied to make it smooth, attractive, and air tight. But cutting/buying thousands of boards, nailing them up, and artfully spreading plaster is time (and money) consuming. Using large, premade sheets to cover the walls would make installation easier and cheaper. When drywall offered all of these benefits, it became to predominant material. However, other materials have come & gone with trends.... real wood (knotty pine is in my house), manufactured (fake) wood paneling, etc. Thoguh I didn't mention it above, the advent of electricity, indoor plumbing, and insulation all contributed to the development of these materials & styles. Likewise the scale that was needed to serve the growing population. Dry is cheaper than wood by far. The space between the outside wall is used for insulation and vapour barrier. I find it interesting that we in the Nordic countries have pretty much the same tradition of building single family homes as in the US (and Canada?), but our friends farther down in Europe (Denmark and south) prefer stone. I guess it is mostly relying on tradition, sparsely populated countries with lots of forest had easy access to, and the tradition of using, lumber. Also, it wood might be better suited when the winters are long and cold. Out homes evolved from log houses with external wood panel and interior clay/paint to studded frame(?) with interior cladding with either lath+drywall or OSB+drywall or drywall+drywall. Single drywall sucks. Outer wall have room for 30cm insulation (one feet for the metrically challenged). To remove problems with condensation in the wall, a plastic foil is needed behind the drywall on the inside. Everyone else has answered about the drywall, but as for why is there such a big space between walls, that's so there's plenty of room to run hot/cold water, water drainage, electricity, cable, phone, AC ductwork, and finally leaving plenty of room for future additions/modifications. Drywall is far cheaper than wood and it is far easier to repair should it become damaged. As to the space between walls that is there for sound proofing, the running of pipes, insulation, the running of electricity, the running of cable, the running of phone lines, the running of internet. Additionally, wood moves. It expands, it contracts, it warps, it twists, it bends. Imagine that over a large flat surface. Plus, drywall is much easier to finish. Many people want nice smooth surfaces. The stud space is there for mechanicals, but mostly for a space in which to insulate. A higher r-value needs more space as it's the air pockets between fibers that creates the insulated value. You can't take an r-11 batt and just squish it down to fit a smaller void... it doesn't work like that. Here in the northern US, you are seeing more homes constructed with 2x6 and occasionally even 2x8 walls (over traditional 2x4 construction) in order to accommodate thicker insulation and higher r-values. Is drywall the same as plaster board? (The standard stuff our interior walls are made of in the uk.) old homes in the usa used board and batten construction. this was a thin wall made form 1x 12 boards with a thin strip to cover the gap between the boards. it is more expensive and flamable plus no insulation is provided other than the r value of the wood. edit: batten I just wanted to answer the thickness part. Making the wall thicker increases the strength of the wall and makes the wooden studs more effective thus reducing the amount of wood required. If the wooden studs were rotated to look like this: ""- - - -"" it would make the wall thinner, but the wall would be more tempted to bend from the weight above it. Since the studs are placed like this ""| | | |"" it makes the wall thicker but stronger. Try taking a plastic ruler, it's easy to bend the flat side, but won't bend in the other direction. Now stand the ruler up and push down on the top part. See how it bows out in the middle and bends? Now imagine making a wall with multiple rulers in the two setups mentioned, you'll see the latter one is stronger.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.05, 'recall': 7.95, 'fmeasure': 13.98}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.78, 'recall': 1.47, 'fmeasure': 2.59}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 36.59, 'recall': 5.01, 'fmeasure': 8.81}}"
Pipeline regulations,"In the US, the PHMSA (Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration) sets the standards for pipeline operation. The regulations state that the gas must be at a minimum temperature of -20°C (-4°F) and a maximum temperature of 35°C (95°F). There are some exceptions, but these are the general limits. In general, the lower temperature is to prevent the gas from freezing, while the higher temperature is to prevent the gas from igniting.","Depends on the country and the regulator, which also depends on where the pipeline is going to, and whether it's onshore or subsea. Here in Australia, you're required to develop a Pipeline Management Plan (PMP) that covers all aspects of the pipeline, e.g.: - Route planning. - Soil erosion and subsidence. - Thermal effects. - Construction (material selection, welding methodology, installation, compression and transmission, integrity verification). - Maintenance (corrosion control, inspection, non-destructive testing). - And, at the end, decommissioning and environmental reconstruction. As for are they doing enough, well, in most cases yes. The majority of pipeline discharges are unrelated to the pipeline itself. Most common is people drive into them, or drag marine anchors over them, or they get dislodged or damaged during severe weathers. Hell, in Nigeria, the locals come in and cut holes in them to steal buckets of oil out of the pipeline, and in more cases than not it blows them the hell up. BP's Alaska pipeline spill was a direct result of cost-cutting. They scaled back on their maintenance program (especially pigging - where you run essentially a drone down the pipe and check corrosion and wall thickness), the pipe corroded and pissed crude oil out of the ground.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 38.16, 'recall': 14.22, 'fmeasure': 20.71}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.33, 'recall': 0.49, 'fmeasure': 0.72}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.68, 'recall': 8.82, 'fmeasure': 12.86}}"
How did the spaceships Challanger and Columbia fail?,"The Challenger was a reusable spacecraft, and it was not designed to handle the low temperatures that occurred during the launch. It was designed to be launched into space at a very high speed, and the heat generated by this high speed caused the rubber O-rings that held the rocket booster together to become brittle and fail. The Columbia was a reusable spacecraft as well, but it was designed differently than the Challenger. It was designed to be launched into space at a slower speed, and this allowed the O-rings to stay soft and flexible. However, the Columbia was designed to be launched into space from a larger rocket, and this made it heavier than the Challenger. The rocket booster that the Columbia was launched with was not powerful enough to lift the Columbia into space. The Columbia was also not designed to handle the heat generated by the rocket booster, and this caused the heat shield to fail.","For the Challenger disaster the right solid rocket booster had an o-ring that was not designed to fly in conditions as cold as they were that day.

For the Columbia disaster a piece of foam insulation broke off the external tank and struck the left wing of the shuttle. This meter-long piece of foam broke off when the craft was traveling at about 2,600 kph and likely caused a 15-25 cm hole in the wing.

First, the contractor or plumber will go to the DPW and request a permit for the job. Next, you need to have your plan in order. A big job requires detailed plans including being up to code. This is the big problem with old houses. It can require lots of renovation to bring old buildings up to code. After you have your plans set up, someone from the DPW will meet you at the property and review the building and your plans. If approved, you do it. Basically, plumbing needs to be the same in any building, new or old. This requires tapping into the main water line, running pipe, branching it off to various rooms and fixtures, installing toilets, fixtures, etc. When you're finished, you get another inspection. The big difference between new and old plumbing is the lead issue. The word 'plumbing' comes from the Latin word for 'lead'. I forgot what the Latin word is... Anyway, current plumbing codes require no lead whatsoever. Old plumbing had lead in the pipes, the solder, and the fixtures. No good. We are currently in the process of renovating our 1865 farm house. The structure is made of limestone rocks held together with mortar. There was no insulation in the walls. It's much like building a whole new house... on the skeleton Sometimes for electric they will surface mount everything if the wall space is inaccessible or nonexistent. This means you would see all the pipe and boxes, similar to [this]( URL_0 ). They can surface mount plumbing and internet cable the same way. It's not pretty, but if you can't access the walls it's sometimes the only option. Typically- any truly old buildings would be covered by a type of preservation law. Depending on the country, there might be codes to which a house is renovated. For example- in America, private property trumps all, unless the deed includes an easement- meaning the legal documents for the property include rules about what changes can happen. Also in America, some concessions are made that allow historic buildings to not follow all modern codes, provided there is no effect on public safety. This is why house museums often are not ADA accessible, even though it typically is mandatory for public buildings. This allows the house to have small corridors and no ramps- as those additions would greatly alter the property. So long story short- When dealing with historic properties, it is always important to know what laws apply to the renovation. It is always expected that plumbing, wiring, etc. MUST be updated.

How do transistors work and be the size of a atom?,"Transistors are made up of tiny structures that are built out of a single layer of semiconductor material. They are called transistors because they have three layers that work together to control the flow of electricity. They are made up of three layers of a semiconductor material called silicon. The three layers are called the base, the collector, and the emitter. The base and the collector are made of a type of silicon called N-type. The emitter is made of a type of silicon called P-type. The N-type and the P-type are different because they have different amounts of free electrons. In the N-type, there are more free electrons than in the P-type. The free electrons in the N-type are attracted to the P-type because of the electric field. The free electrons in the P-type are attracted to the N-type because of the electric field. When there is a current flowing through the N-type and the P-type, there is a flow of electrons from the N-type to the P-type. This flow of electrons is called a current. The current is controlled by the N-type and the P-type. When the N-type and the P-type are connected to a power source, the N-type and the P-type will control the flow of electrons.  ","The operation of a vacuum tube is a lot like a Field Effect Transistor (FET), but the actual mechanism of operation is a bit different. And the construction is very different. Transistors are ""solid state""...there's no vacuum (or moving parts). So transistors are much more reliable and ""shrinkable"". One of the great things about transistors was that people figured out how to manufacture a bunch of them at the same time in a circuit configuration (an ""Integrated Circuit"", or IC). Then they figured out to make the whole circuit smaller, and smaller, and smaller. This is what enabled the microelectronics revolution over the last 50 years. Sometimes people describe transistors as little switches, but this is not quite accurate. They are actually little amplifiers, but we *use* them like little switches in digital electronics. (In analog electronics, we use them like little amplifiers, which is what they are.) In a FET, there are 3 connections. How much current passes between the Source and Drain connections is controlled by the voltage put on the Gate connection. (There's actually a 4th connection, but we can neglect it for this description.) So you can amplify a small signal by putting it on the Gate and letting it control a large current between the Source and Drain. In digital logic, you either put a very little voltage on the Gate, or a lot. So the SD current is either very little, or a lot. In this way, the transistor acts like a switch, except the switch isn't controlled by anything mechanical, it is controlled by the Gate voltage. The smallest transistor I've ever hear of is a [quantum dot]( URL_0 ), or perhaps a [single-electron transistor]( URL_1 ). These are still in their infancy, and I don't understand them enough to describe them. They don't really work like the ubiquitous FET that are in so many things today. In today's FETs, some of the materials are down to one atomic layer *thick*. But the whole transistor is still larger than an atom.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 40.0, 'recall': 26.51, 'fmeasure': 31.89}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.99, 'recall': 4.62, 'fmeasure': 5.57}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.0, 'recall': 13.26, 'fmeasure': 15.94}}"
"Why are cars designed so the fuel tank is easily accessible from the outside, but to refill the windshield washer fluid requires lifting the hood?","It's not just cars. Most vehicles have a fuel tank that is easily accessible from the outside, while other fluids are not. There are a few reasons for this. First, the fuel tank is the most important part of the vehicle, and it's very important to be able to easily access it in case of an emergency. Second, the fuel tank is usually located in a convenient place for the driver. It's usually under the hood, which is a place that is easy for the driver to access while driving. Finally, the fuel tank is usually a large, heavy part of the vehicle, and it's easier to access it from the outside than it is to open the hood and reach it from inside. The windshield washer fluid is much smaller and lighter than the fuel tank, and it's usually located in a much more inconvenient place, under the hood. It's also much easier to access the windshield washer fluid from inside the vehicle, since it's usually located near the driver's seat. There are a few reasons why the windshield washer fluid is located under the hood. One reason is that the windshield washer fluid is not as important as the fuel tank. If the windshield washer fluid runs out, it's not as big of a deal as running out of fuel.  ","Because you fill the tank regularly. Most people can go months without having to refill the washer fluid. It is topped off during oil changes and most people probably never have to fill it themselves. People need to refill their gas often multiple times a week. People need to refill their windshield wiper fluid yearly. Engineers want to protect your property however easy access to gas is a priority. To consolidate this dilemma many vehicles only allow access to the gas tank via an interior unlock latch. You need to refill the fuel tank a lot more often. The fuel tank is often located some distance away from the engine, so it wouldn't make sense for the opening to be inside the hood.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 21.65, 'recall': 40.32, 'fmeasure': 28.17}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.65, 'recall': 10.57, 'fmeasure': 7.37}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 12.12, 'recall': 22.58, 'fmeasure': 15.77}}"

If you have a fault in a circuit and the circuit breaker trips, you are still at risk of electrical shock. The GFCI receptacle is designed to trip when there is a fault in the circuit, but it is also designed to trip when there is a fault in the appliance.

Here ""too much"" is on the order of 15 *amps*. By the time the breaker trips it's far too late for the person being shocked. GCFI trips if the current imbalance exceeds a *much* lower value, around 0.006 amp. A circuit breaker only shuts off if excess current is drawn through it. In most cases a short circuit between the hot and neutral will cause excess current to flow causing the breaker to trip. If there is a short between the hot and ground, again it should cause the breaker to trip. However if there is a short between the hot and some other ground path outside of the circuit, it might not cause excess current to flow. This could still be incredibly dangerous because you can be seriously injured or killed from as little as 0.05A Most home circuits in the US are 15A. So as you can plainly see, the circuit breaker will do nothing to help in this case. The Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter on the other hand compares the current flowing through the hot to the current returning on the neutral. If the two are not the same, then some current must be leaking out of the circuit somewhere else and that is clearly a dangerous fault condition. A circuit breaker will trip on a fault current equal to the rated value in 10 or 15 minutes. An overload twice that would trip in a few seconds. A person will fry badly in that time. A GCFI trips in a few hundredths of a second.

"What was to keep a telegraph message from going past its intended destination? How was a message not received by another machine 10 miles further down or the ""leap frog"" paradox prevented?","/u/Tech_Talker is correct. The telegraph was a single point to point system, so you could not send a message to multiple destinations at once. However, the telegraph system was designed to prevent messages from being sent past their intended destination. In the early days of the telegraph, messages were sent by Morse code, which is a series of dots and dashes that represent letters and numbers. Each station had a unique sequence of dots and dashes that represented the station's name. When a message was sent, it was sent with the station's name in the beginning. The receiving station would then decode the message and send a response back to the originating station. This was done in order to prevent messages from being sent past their intended destination. If a message was sent to a station that did not have the correct station name, the receiving station would not be able to decode it. The message would then be sent back to the originating station.   originating station had the correct station name, it would send the message back to the receiving station.   receiving station did not have the correct station name, it would send the message back to the originating station. In the case of the ""leap frog"" paradox, the originating station would send a message to a station that was not its intended destination, and then the message would be sent back to the originating station.  ","I just want to point out that that's not what a paradox is. Machine A only sends to Machine B. If you want C to get the message then B will need to relay it manually, then C to D. Alternatively some networks like rail lines would act like a party call so *everyone* gets the message all at once. You would need to use call signs to indicate which station the message was intended for, and of course only one person could be transmitting at a time. Central switching stations There weren't that many telegraphs around, generally one per town, maybe a few in a big city. The first thing you telegraph would be a request for connection to the message destination and someone in the central switching station would unplug you from the main board and plug you into your destination so you can send your message to your destination. Telephones used this same system and ended up running on the same wires as telegraphs. Modern telephones use an automated switch board, but it is still wires running from every end point to central locations that connect you to your destination.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 32.78, 'recall': 40.51, 'fmeasure': 36.24}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.25, 'recall': 7.73, 'fmeasure': 6.91}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.52, 'recall': 17.95, 'fmeasure': 16.06}}"

What is the difference between the various semi-automatic gun mechanisms?," M16 is a gas operated system. It uses a gas port on the barrel to push a piston back, which then pushes the bolt back. The bolt then pushes the round out of the chamber and into the magazine. It also uses a spring to return the bolt to the rear of the weapon. The M4 is similar to the M16, but has a collapsible stock and a shorter barrel. It is also designed to be more compact and lightweight. M4 carbine uses a direct impingement gas system. The gas is directed directly into the carrier, which is then pushed back by the gas. The carrier then pushes the bolt back and the round is ejected from the chamber. The carrier then returns to the rear of the weapon and the bolt is pushed forward again. M14 is a gas operated system. It uses a gas port on the barrel to push a piston back, which then pushes the bolt back. The bolt then pushes the round out of the chamber and into the magazine. It also uses a spring to return the bolt to the rear of the weapon. The M14 is also known as the Springfield M1A. It has a longer barrel than the M16 and has a heavier bolt. It is designed to be a sniper rifle.  ","The most simple form is straight blowback Straight blowback works by having an unlocked bolt behind the round in the chamber. when the gun is fired the gas pressure exerts a force on the bolt and it is forced away from the chamber. As it moves rearwards the empty case is pulled out. When the bolt reaches the rear of it's travel it moves forward again using the force stored in the recoil spring. On the way forwards it strips a new round from the magazine and pushes it into the chamber ready to fire again. The main disadvantage of blowback firearms is that the only thing keeping the bolt in battery (against the chamber) is the inertia of the bolt. In order to be safe the case needs to be supported in the chamber until the pressure in the chamber has dropped (after the bullet has left the barrel). As the power of the round being fired increases the mass of the bolt must increase. Delayed blowback is similar in operation except there will be some mechanism that will increase the inertia of the bolt without adding mass. For example the roller delayed blowback system used in the HK MP5 sub machinegun and G3 rifle or the lever delayed system used in the FAMAS rifle. The mechanism generally works by having a two part bolt having some method of forcing one half to move faster than the bolt face thus giving the bolt assembly more inertia than a one piece bolt of the same mass. Blow forward is the opposite of blowback. The bolt is in a fixed position and the drag of the bullet travelling through the barrel pulls the barrel forwards off the empty case. As the barrel reaches the end of it's forward travel the empty case is ejected and the barrel returns under spring pressure. As it travels back it collects a new round and chambers it. This method of operation is extremely rare and was only used in a few firearms Recoil operation means that when the gun is fired the bolt and barrel both move backwards together. This gives the bullet more time to leave the barrel than a blowback design. There are two main types of recoil operation: short recoil and long recoil. Short recoil operation means that the barrel and bolt are locked together when in battery and only travel a short distance before the barrel unlocks from the bolt. After this happens the barrel stops and the bolt continues. The empty case is ejected and the bolt returns forward collecting a new round and chambering it. The bolt gets to the barrel and moves it forward into the locked position ready to fire again. Most semi-auto pistols use a short recoil action with a browning tilting barrel design which works by locking the barrel into the slide via locking lugs above the chamber. As the barrel moves rearward it drops down which disconnects it from the slide. For example see the 1911. Other short recoil systems include the toggle locked (luger pistol) and rotating barrel (gsh18, beretta px4). Long recoil operation means that when the gun is fired both the bolt and barrel travel all the way to the end of travel. At this point the bolt stays at the rear and the barrel returns to the forward position. When the barrel slides off the empty case which is held by the bolt the case is ejected and the bolt then moves forward collecting a new round and chambering it. An example of this is the Browning A5 shotgun. Gas operated firearms use tap some gas from a port in the barrel and use it to operate the gun. Gas operated firearms can be put into 2 categories: direct impingement and piston operated. Direct impingement firearms work by blowing gas directly at the bolt carrier which then moves rearward unlocking the bolt and ejects a round. For example the AG m/42 rifle. An alternative is the system used in the AR10 and AR15 rifle which is where gas is tapped off the barrel and directed into the bolt carrier via the gas key. Once inside the carrier it expands in the space behind the bolt (which has a gas piston and rings at the rear) causing the bolt carrier to move rearward and unlock the bolt and then carry it the the rear. If memory serves this system was originally called an ""expanding gas system"" but is usually called direct impingement now. Gas piston systems work by directing gas from the barrel and using it to push a piston which moves the bolt carrier to operate the firearm. There are two types: short stroke and long stroke systems. Short stroke is where the piston only travels a short distance just enough to give the bolt carrier a kick which sets it into motion. Examples of this are the HK G36 rifle, FN SCAR rifle and the Steyr Aug Rifle. Long stroke is where the piston is attatched to the bolt carrier and travels all the way to the rear and all the way forward again. For example the AK47 rifle and M1 Garand rifle. Two different ways that the bolt can unlock are by tilting or rotating. All the rifles I mentioned previously as examples of gas piston systems all have rotating bolts. Examples of tilting bolts are the VZ58 rifle and the FN FAL. Other actions exist too, I forget the name but there is a gun that used a combination blow forward/blow back action. Also check out the Mateba auto revolver.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 76.82, 'recall': 18.02, 'fmeasure': 29.19}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 30.59, 'recall': 7.15, 'fmeasure': 11.59}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 43.64, 'recall': 10.23, 'fmeasure': 16.58}}"
Why do a lot of bridges only have short barriers on the sides vs. tall ones?,"It's a safety thing. If you fall off the side of a bridge, you'll hit the water below.

But if you fall off the side, you'll live, but you'll have to go through the process of getting your leg back on the bridge. It's much better to just get it back on the bridge right away.","Walls only need to be a little higher than the vehicle's center of gravity. Steel in the walls will stretch and deflect the vehicle back to the road. The only way it would roll over the top is if the center of gravity somehow gets above the top of the wall AND still has sufficient momentum to carry it over. This is really unlikely. To have barriers go all the way up introduces a host of other problems. The first of which is the significant weight of the wall itself, which now has to be carried by the bridge structure. Then lets say someone smacks into the wall really good. They'll hit the bottom bit, cracking it like a tree. What happens when the top bit starts falling down towards the roadway? Also, every time this happens you'll need to fix the entire wall section, which is more expensive the higher it is. Take a look at bridge and roadway barriers as you drive around town now. They're all designed to break in key spots and NOT break in others. Most barriers will snap off at the base pretty easily, but the barrier itself is a continuous steel strip. The broken bases will slow your vehicle down but not stop it immediately. The steel strip will stretch and not break, stretching until your vehicle comes to a stop. Engineers do the math on how much stretching the barrier can tolerate, and make sure you can't stretch into another lane or over the side of the bridge. If you're going to die on a car wreck over a a bridge, it's going to take some significant effort.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 51.65, 'recall': 16.61, 'fmeasure': 25.13}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.44, 'recall': 4.61, 'fmeasure': 6.99}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.87, 'recall': 10.25, 'fmeasure': 15.51}}"

They're very simple devices that only have a few functions. They don't have a lot of moving parts, and they don't use a lot of power. The only reason they have a backup power supply is to ensure that the transponder will still work if the plane's electrical system fails. This is important, because if the transponder is not functioning, it's very difficult to identify the plane. But the transponder does not have to be very hard to turn off. It's not like a flight data recorder, which has a lot of data that needs to be preserved. The transponder just needs to send out a signal that identifies the plane. The only reason that the transponder is hard to turn off is to prevent it from being tampered with. If the transponder is turned off, it's not going to send out a signal that identifies the plane. This is a problem, because if the transponder is turned off, it's very difficult to identify the plane. But if the transponder is turned off, it's not going to be a problem. The plane will still be able to fly, and the transponder will still be able to send out a signal that identifies the plane. This is why the transponder is not very hard to turn off.  ","Because the transponder isn't as critical to the operation of an airplane. The main purpose of a transponder is to make it easier for air traffic control to tell which airplane is which, and to relay altitude information. If the transponder fails, the pilot has to verbally relay that information, which slows things down. But a plane can land just fine without a transponder. A transponder is not designed for locating a plane after a crash. It can be used that way in an emergency if it survives the crash, but that is not what it is for. Finally, if a transponder becomes faulty, it can broadcast bad information and interfere with other aircraft, so it is important for a pilot be able to turn it off as necessary.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 28.88, 'recall': 51.54, 'fmeasure': 37.02}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.19, 'recall': 9.3, 'fmeasure': 6.67}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.52, 'recall': 27.69, 'fmeasure': 19.89}}"
How do we get so well-lit pictures from Juno and New Horizons for example from places where the sun does not provide as much light?,"The spacecraft use special solar panels that are designed to collect as much energy as possible from the sun. They are also equipped with batteries that can store the energy for use when the spacecraft is in the shade.

They also have special cameras that can capture images of the sun in different wavelengths, which allows them to see the sun even when it is not visible to the human eye.","They are very long exposures. The camera lens (shutter) is held open for many seconds. If the vehicle is zooming by, they actually pivot the vehicle while the shutter is open, to keep the shot steady.

"What causes 'house noises', and when does it become dangerous?","The sound of a train is caused by the wind pushing through the gaps in the train, and the sound of the wheels rolling on the track.

It is only dangerous if you are in the path of the train.","Homes heat and cool over the course of the day, and the structure of most wood frame houses will creak a bit because the heating and cooling tends to be uneven (it's typically warmer in the upper floors of a house). It's only dangerous if the house is actually improperly built and is structurally unsound. Bad sounds in a brick house sound like someone hitting two bricks together. Its loud enough to identify it as “yup, that’s bricks” and not the regular creaking and cracking you might hear. This indicates the brick walls are shifting significantly and cracking. This usually is caused by the foundation sinking unevenly. If you notice this frequently, and you’ve got uneven floors, doors won’t close that used to, cracking plaster, you need to get a pro in to evaluate. It’s very unlikely to collapse around you, but the damage is going to continue to get worse, and more expensive the longer you wait.

Back in 1936 the Nazis managed to broadcast the olympics to many different countries. Why can my local radio station signal only manage a range of 100-200 km?,"The range of a radio signal depends on the power of the transmitter and the efficiency of the antenna. In the case of the Olympics, the signal was transmitted from a large broadcasting tower in Germany. The signal was then broadcast over a large network of transmitters and antennas. This allowed the signal to reach many different countries. In contrast, a local radio station in the US is broadcasting on a much smaller scale. They have a much smaller transmitter and a much smaller antenna. This means that the signal can only reach a much smaller area.","> Back in 1936 the Nazis managed to broadcast the olympics to many different countries. The 1936 Olympics were only broadcast live to 25 special viewing booths in Berlin. Tapes were sent out to other countries after the fact. At the time what was used for long distance transmission was ""shortwave"" radio, now technically called ""High Frequency"" or ""HF."" The wavelength of shortwave signal causes it to have the inherent characteristic to ""skip"" off of the D layer of the atmosphere, giving it the ability to travel an extremely long distance. That coupled with the much higher amount of power used to transmit on shortwave frequencies versus VHF (FM) makes it capable of travelling even further. Regular FM radio stations exist on a limited bandwidth. Since there are so many stations on the FM band taking up a limited space, they have to share their frequencies with other stations that exist in other places. Think of it like this; there is a station in one county that transmits on 107.9 MHz. In an adjacent county, there is another station that transmits on that same frequency. In order to keep from interfering with each other, they are both limited to 1,000 watts of transmitting power each. Now on the shortwave side; there's a station that transmits on 14.00 MHz., and there is no other station in the world that transmits on that frequency. So therefore, it's not limited in wattage. It could use a million watts, maybe two million watts, to create a much more powerful signal. Shortwave radio was pretty much the 1920s-1940s primitive version of the internet. And it worked, so much so that it still exists, and so much so that it is on occasion the only source of communication available. The CB radio band is a shortwave band. It's the shortwave radio's version of /b/.

What is a bump stock? Does it make a gun full auto?," Dont know the answer, but I'm sure it's not good. Bump stocks are a device that allows a semi-automatic weapon to fire like a fully automatic weapon. They do this by using the recoil of the gun to ""bump"" the trigger, allowing the user to fire multiple rounds without pulling the trigger multiple times. They are legal in the United States, but have been banned in many other countries. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing. I think the idea is that it allows you to fire multiple rounds faster, but you're still firing a semi-automatic weapon. I think the main concern is that it makes the weapon more dangerous. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.","[Here's a video of one in use]( URL_0 ). A semi-auto rifle can only fire one round every time you pull the trigger but many modern weapons can fire as fast as you can pull. The bump stock causes the recoil of the weapon to push the gun back slightly and disengage the trigger so that when the weapon returns forward, you trigger the trigger again. This gives you the same results of a full-auto weapon (at a slight decrease in accuracy) without meeting the legal definition of being an ""automatic weapon"". Okay, so when you shoot a gun there is the part behind the trigger that your hand holds and the buttstock that your shoulder rests on. Essentially what a bump fire stock does is the shoot firmly grabs the stock and holds it tight the the shoulder while holding their finger very rigid. As they pull the trigger, the rest of the run recoils into the bump fire stock that the shooter is still holding, and then bounces (or bumps) back forward causing the trigger to hit the shooters rigid finger which cause the gun to fire again and the process repeats. Did I explain it alright or am I clear as mud? A semi-automatic weapon will fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. If you hold it just right, where your finger remains stationary and the weapon is braced with your other hand/arm, every time it kicks it with bounce back into your trigger finger and fire again and again until you lose your grip or you run out of ammo. It wildly inaccurate, and mostly is an expensive, noisy, slightly dangerous but kind of fun trick. You can buy a special stock, the bump stock, which makes it easier to pull off. Still pretty inaccurate, but if all you want to do is fire into a crowd...:(","{'rouge1': {'precision': 54.41, 'recall': 23.27, 'fmeasure': 32.6}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.85, 'recall': 5.05, 'fmeasure': 7.08}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.74, 'recall': 11.01, 'fmeasure': 15.42}}"
Every month there’s a new micro SD card with more space than the last. We’re fitting gigs of data when a decade ago we could only fit megabytes. But what’s the theoretical limit of how much data we can store in a micro SD card? How can we keep fitting more data in smaller spaces?,"The answer to this is really simple. The limit of how much data you can store on a microSD card is the limit of how many electrons you can store in a given volume. In other words, it's the limit of how much matter you can store in a given volume. Now, the density of matter is a function of the pressure you apply to it, so if you apply a higher pressure, you can fit more matter in a given volume. So, to make a more dense microSD card, you just need to apply more pressure. This is why you see different types of microSD cards, like the ""UHS-II"" or ""UHS-III"" cards. These are the fastest cards you can get, but they are also the densest, meaning that they have the most matter in a given volume. It's worth noting that the current technology has reached the point where you can't make it denser, because the electrons are now starting to be ""squeezed"" in such a way that they start to interact with each other. This is called the ""Coulomb blockade"" and it's a fundamental limit that cannot be overcome. So, you'll see that the next generation of microSD cards will be slower than the current ones, but they will still be denser. This is because they will use a different technology, which will allow them to store more matter in the same volume.","Moore's law states that the performance of semiconductor technology improves by a factor of two roughly every 18 months. For something like an sd card, the data is stored by effectively etching out a physical space on the semiconductor material for each bit of data to be stored. These chips are created by a die (think of it like a printing press or vinyl press except at a really small scale, like nanometers) and draw out the circuits onto the semiconductor material. As the die technology improves, the resolution that the circuitry can be created gets better and better at a smaller and smaller scale. The theoretical limit of this particular technology breaks down once you can draw out circuits down to the scale of a single atom thick. If you try splitting that atom to go smaller, that's called nuclear fission and would probably be bad for anyone in a several mile radius. I'm not sure when that projection is scheduled to be here, but there's a good chance that quantum computing will pick up before that limit becomes the commercially viable option. Quantum technology has the potential to provide an even greater exponential increase in storage capacity and computational speed. No idea on what that limit could be, but there's a chance we hit the next technology before that limit too... that is unless the robots win or we blow ourselves up with our godlike computational prowess :) Last I read, the SDXC standard put the maximum at 2TB of file space per card, though capacities haven't reached that yet. Physical limitations on cell size my not allow this, and newer standards for SD cards are shifted to throughput speeds instead of capacity. So right now, pending a new file standard, the upper limit is 2TB. Every time a new and smaller/denser chip technology is made, the size (eg 7nm) is not evenly spread. This isn't quite answer to your question but it's also interesting. Due to quantum tunneling and similar things we can't really go much smaller than that. This way of making only certain parts super small is a clever way of pushing the limits of current technology a bit further. But we can't really go much further than this. [This]( URL_0 ) video from SciShow explains it pretty well. Not so much every month for space, rather for reliability and bandwidth. For instance I remember only a few years ago when solid state drives were not reliable at all. I'm also a bit different, I would prefer having a 256GiB microSD over a 512GiB regular SD. I thought that whole 200GiB gimmick was silly and ingenious at the same time. SD cards are more arbitrary, so it would probably be better to work in centimeters, I mean you wouldn't mind a 1 cm by 1 cm (square) by 10 mm thick card if it hit the theoretical limit, would you? It would also be easy to relate to the size of an SD card. Even better is they use something called nanometer or nm gauged setups, which you get a million per centimeter. So 1,000,000 * 1,000,000 is 1,000,000,000,000 or a trillion bits. Since we use bytes instead of bits you divide by 8 and round to the nearest computing magnitude yielding 128 GiB. Why not 125? Because in computing the numbers work on doubling rather than incrementing like in decimal. This is called binary, or hexadecimal (meaning 6 and 10, or 16). Anyways, you're probably going to be looking at something like 2^40 or 1,099,511,627,776 bits rather than an even trillion. So wait, we have cards that have 256 GiB that are much smaller than a centimeter and we're not even to a 1 nm process yet? What evil magic is this?! It isn't. It's called layers. I'm sure you don't want a card only a nanometer thick! All that itty bitty (to you and me) yet massive (to the switches) extra space lets you stack these cards! [Notice here it says Samsung's microSD cards are made out of what? **3D** V-NAND]( URL_2 ). They are saying they can make this up to 100 layers thick, and they are using a [19 nanometer process (PDF file)]( URL_1 ) to do it. Yes, that's 20x less capacity than we've been working with here, but it doesn't matter when you have 100x more room. If they ever do get that down to 1 nm you'll have 100 trillion little switches! Not only that but what if that allows them to increase the amount of layers by 20x as well? Then you're looking at quadrillions, or 15 zeroes. Those would be petabytes or PB.

Why do they make 'normal' cars that go faster than the speed limits? e.g. Hyundai i10 that goes up to 150mph,"A car's speed is determined by its engine size and gearing. The engine size is a factor of the size of the engine and the amount of fuel it burns. The gearing is a factor of the number of gears and the ratio of each gear. The larger the engine size and the larger the gear ratio, the faster the car will go. The speed limit is a law that is enforced by police officers. If you are caught driving faster than the speed limit, you will be ticketed. If you are caught driving at a speed that is too fast for the road you are on, you will be ticketed.

Not so much so for your base models but for higher end cars Top Speed and how quickly a car gets there may affect which car someone buys. * The second is engine size. the larger an engine in terms of capacity and the number of cylinders makes a car smoother, hence why a Bentley may have a 12 cylinder engine, but may only produce as much power as a 6 cylinder, more sporty car. A by-product of this may be that the top speed is higher, and will certainly be higher than the top speed of any speed limit. * A sub point of the one above is engine wear. Larger engines tend to take the stress of mileage a lot better. This would obviously depend who and how they drive it, but an engine working at less stress is generally a less troublesome one. A by product of this is a higher top speed (in some cases) * The next is top speeds of roads. In Germany they have speed limitless motorways/freeways called Autobahns. This means in certain markets it is appealing to have a car that can far exceed a speed limit that may appear in another country and it would not be cost-efficient for a manufacturer to tailor a car just for one market (we're talking speed here, not other factors such as which hand drive the car is) * If a state/country was to make law that cars had to have a speed limiter, it would only apply to new cars and would cause a gigantic list of issues and cost for very little gain. It would also mean that governments could not earn revenue from fining motorists for breaking the limits (like it or not, it is a fact the government earns money from people using their car above the road limits). * The most important thing about the top speed is related to a cars gear ratios and where a car will sit in terms of speed and revolutions (RPM) of the engine. A combustion engine car (a car that takes petrol or diesel) will be most efficient sitting in RPM and speed terms towards the lower to middle end of its RPM scale (if a car red lines at 8,000 rpm, 2,500-4,000 rpm will likely be its most efficient). This satisfies two things, one is fuel consumption, which affects why someone may buy a car, less fuel consumption means less money spent on fuel, and the next is emissions standards, which is particularly important in countries such as Britain, where the amount of tax on a vehicle is based on the amount of emissions the car kicks out. To satisfy this, the very top of the highest most gear would need to be well above the local speed limits in order for that speed limit to achieve good fuel consumption and limit emissions. The points above generally fit under a limiter fitted to a car to limit its top speed. It would be far too expensive to carry out an operation like this, and my cynical view is governments would not earn revenue from people breaking the speed limit and instead would have to spend money enforcing limiters. Manufacturers don't limit speeds because they are competing against each other, who in turn are all trying to get the most in every way out of a car. The next points relate to having engines small enough so that they can only reach 70. This would be incredibly impractical for everyday use as I will explain: * Hills. Going up a hill is harder work for an engine. A small engine would struggle with a hill. * People and weight. Cars and vehicles are used to transport things, limiting an engine size limits a cars ability to transport more things. A phenomenon which every young man with a car will experience is their first car. Traditionally a young British male's first car will be a small, cheap and old hatchback with a tiny little engine as this is the only form of motoring he can afford. Carrying on tradition, you will at some point ferry yourself and 4 of your near-adult weight friends around to your destination (a lot of the time there is no destination and you are just simply driving your mates around). These small engines struggle greatly and performance is hindered, and if you add a hill, the problem gets twice as bad. I will now list these quickly: * Acceleration/Performance of a small engine would be terrible, trying to keep up with traffic would be a constant task/worry * Fuel consumption would be terrible * Engine wear would happen a lot quicker as parts are having to work harder. The list is endless, but another side point is, for everyone that enjoys their cars - if someone made you limit your car to a speed, would you enjoy it as much? The answer is probably not, and the economy surrounding cars is too great for one government to lose over another (think of tourism Germany gets for individuals wanting to take their cars to the Nurburgring and on their Autobahns.) Note - I feel this was very long winded. Feel free to pick at anything. Honestly. Edit - Thank you for your comments. As Kkrit pointed out - most of Germany's Autobahn's have top speed limits now, but there are still a few without. It is without doubt the most famous and unique example of where speed limits aren't in place. Edit 2 - I tidied the formatting up! Because otherwise it's not very sympathetic to the car's mechanical parts. For instance if you say ""Well my highway has speed limit of 70mph so I'll buy a car that has a top speed of 70mph"". Well great, but in order to do highway speeds you then have to be absolutely hammering the engine, with your foot plastered to the floor just to keep up with the traffic. A car that can do 150 will be just cruising nicely at highway speeds, while your 70mph top speed car will be screaming, with the exhaust pipes glowing, smoke pouring out of the bonnet, and everyone in the car being shaken to death. Just because it can do it, doesn't mean you will, it just means that at the speeds you're *meant* to travel at, it won't be overstressing the engine. Because top speed is still a selling point, mostly. As long as people are willing to pay for a fast car, companies will make them. Also, speed limits vary worldwide, and some places such as racetracks or the Autobahn have no limits at all. Finally, a car with a weak engine that can just maintain the speed limit will have dangerously bad acceleration, and will be too slow against a headwind or up hill. There's no compelling reason to artificially limit a car's top speed. If you just made the engine so small that the car couldn't go past, say, 70 mph, it would accelerate extremely slowly, probably to the point of being dangerous. Think about us humans. Our top speed is when sprinting. We get tired very quickly when doing that and it stresses out our bodies. But for our normal every day pace when walking, it's very easy to do that. If our max speed was our walking pace, we would get tired fast, since that would as difficult as sprinting. A higher top speed makes the lower speeds that you experience every day a lot easier to handle, whether for walking or at highway speeds for cars. it's about the horsepower. in order to make a 1000kg car to go with 90km/s on a straight road, you need about ~20hp. but going above 90 is problematic because of the wind resistance(drag) increases way to much(in the formula it has ^3). imagine using a i10 with 20 hp. it can't really go uphill, you can't really load it and it will have a painful acceleration. you can avoid this by making it 90hp, it will give you a comfortable ride under the speed limit, and it can reach around 180km/s as a side effect.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.69, 'recall': 10.87, 'fmeasure': 18.48}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.81, 'recall': 3.13, 'fmeasure': 5.32}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 37.5, 'recall': 6.61, 'fmeasure': 11.23}}"

Weather radars are similar to the radar used on aircraft, but they are much larger and more powerful. They can detect clouds at much greater distances and can track the movement of clouds over a much larger area. Weather radar is a system to detect precipitation, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, using radio waves. It is a type of radar, which uses radio waves to detect and locate objects. Weather radar systems use two types of radar: primary radar and secondary radar. Primary radar detects the weather conditions and secondary radar detects aircraft. Secondary radar is used to detect aircraft, while primary radar detects weather. In order to detect weather, primary radar uses a pulse radar, which sends out a burst of radio waves and measures how long it takes to bounce back. The time it takes for the radio waves to bounce back depends on the distance of the weather. The closer the weather is to the radar, the faster the radio waves will bounce back.  ","> I can't imagine every beam is able to report its complete itinerary back to the station like ""I bounced from position A to B ... to Z and then finally back to you for good""...so how does this work? And yet it does! Or, more exactly, the radar shoots out a pulse. Then it opens its eyes and starts looking for reflections. Every nanosecond it sees how much of a reflection it gets. And because it knows how fast light travels, and of course it knows what direction it's looking in, it knows where that reflection came from. (It knows that it must be a direct reflection because it looks at the strongest signal it got, which is practically speaking almost impossible to be a multipath reflection). If it gets a strong reflection 50,000 nanoseconds after it emits the pulse, it knows it's hitting a cloud at about 25,000 feet away (light travels about 1 foot in 1 nanosecond).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 22.67, 'recall': 31.1, 'fmeasure': 26.22}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.23, 'recall': 3.07, 'fmeasure': 2.58}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 11.11, 'recall': 15.24, 'fmeasure': 12.85}}"

Obviously they can't get rid of the lightning port but if lightning can do everything the 3.5 mm audio jack can do then removing it would be expected to lower rates of water damage. Note that this holds true regardless of if the audio port is any easier to secure against water or not. I think there are more compelling arguments in favor of the move though. For example the lightning port has the potential to provide superior sound quality compared to a normal audio jack. Why? The lightning port can provide external power to connected devices by drawing from the internal battery. This can power amplifiers and various audio processing hardware in the connected devices, as well as things like active noise cancelation which would otherwise require power storage integrated into the devices themselves at the cost of increased weight, the cost of complexity, and the need to charge more devices. Obviously something like USB-C might be an even better solution but the lightning cable has been around for four years now while USB-C is still picking up steam.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 40.74, 'recall': 18.49, 'fmeasure': 25.43}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.61, 'recall': 2.53, 'fmeasure': 3.49}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.15, 'recall': 10.5, 'fmeasure': 14.45}}"

What's counter torque and why is it needed to make a helicopter fly?,"Counter torque is the torque that opposes the rotor torque. It's what keeps the rotor spinning. Helicopters don't have wings like planes do, they have rotors. The rotors are pushed down by the air and the rotor torque is the force that keeps the rotor spinning. Counter torque is what keeps the rotor spinning. It's the force that keeps the rotor spinning when the rotor torque is acting on it. It's like the rotor torque is trying to make the rotor stop spinning, but the counter torque is pushing it back.","A helicopter flies by using an engine to spin a primary rotor, but that rotor has inertia so when trying to spin it there is a force pushing back that tries to spin the helicopter body too. Counter torque is provided by the tail rotor and ensures that only the main rotor rotates around the shaft and the body of the helicopter isn't also spinning around the shaft. This is why a helicopter that loses the tail rotor starts spinning out of control Remember Newton's third law of motion? Each action has an equal and opposite reaction. Imagine a helicopter with no tail rotor, and the main rotor spins counter clockwise. The helicopter's body will spin opposite to the helicopter's blades. So without a tail rotor, the body will just keep turning clockwise. In order to stabilize the body from turning in circles constantly, the tail rotor provides a force that pushes the helicopter's tail counter-clockwise, balancing out the torque provided by the main rotor. [Here's a video on YouTube that provides a visual example and explains the mechanics behind a tail rotor.]( URL_0 ) There are helicopters without tail rotors, but they have some sort of mechanism at the tail that produces the same effect a tail rotor does: provide a force at the tail opposite the helicopter's spin. People here are mixing up the air resistance of the rotor with the torque from the engine. The torque that makes the helicopter spin comes from the engine spinning the rotor. If the rotor spins and is braked by air resistance no torque is applied to the body. This is actually very important, as it allows you to do an autorotation (landing without engine power) if the tail rotor fails. . Also there are helicopter designs that do fly without any sort of tail rotor or torque compensation. E. G. You can pump gas through the blades, that comes out at the tip of the blade pointing backwards. This induces no torque on the body URL_0 The main rotor is constantly cutting into the air in one direction. If there was nothing bracing the body of the helicopter it would start turning in the other direction. Just like if you try to push something heavy while standing on a slippery surface you could go backwards, instead of pushing the object forward. A helicopter has a vertical rotor on the back to counter the spinning of the main rotor.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 76.84, 'recall': 17.55, 'fmeasure': 28.57}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.89, 'recall': 3.37, 'fmeasure': 5.5}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 45.26, 'recall': 10.34, 'fmeasure': 16.83}}"

This means the engine will output more power, causing the car to accellerate. However, this accelleration doesn't continue forever. Mainly because as a car's speed increases, the amount of wind resistance increases as well, that's like a force pushing against the car forcing it to slow down. So when you press the accellerator, the engine will push the car harder, and as it speeds up, the air will push harder against it. Once they reach an equilibrium, the car stops accellerating and instead maintains a constant speed. In new cars it's electronic. You push it and it tells the engine how much gas and oxygen to let in (for combustion). Older cars have a cable attached to the pedal that connects to the throttle body (lets air in the engine). My pushing the pedal it in return pulls the cable and opens the throttle body butterfly valve. More oxygen = more power, so the more you push the pedal the more oxygen gets sucked in which in turn accelerates the car.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 28.57, 'recall': 29.32, 'fmeasure': 28.94}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.23, 'recall': 9.47, 'fmeasure': 9.35}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.41, 'recall': 20.94, 'fmeasure': 20.67}}"
How does the smoke detector know the difference betweem smoke and steam?," The detector contains a small amount of a radioactive isotope, usually Americium 241. The isotope is sealed in a small metal canister which is suspended in the air. When smoke particles pass through the canister, they block some of the radioactive gamma rays from escaping. The detector is connected to an electrical circuit which monitors the amount of gamma rays that are being blocked. If the number of gamma rays being blocked is above a certain threshold, the circuit sends an electrical signal to trigger the detector.","There is many different types of smoke detectors out there. Some can't see the difference between smoke and steam, but the more complex ones does a good job of separating the two. The ones I use at work now is: * optical. (Think LED in one end of chamber and a photo-resistor in the other end. Mesures the amount of light that get through.) * double optical and thermal. (Uses two different angels on the chamber for the optical part to guesstimate the difference in smoke and steam based on different reflections.) * optical / thermal / gas. (Reads Co2. Works like a champ in theaters, clubs etc. that uses theatrical smoke on stage.) * only thermal. (Works on the principle of fire is hot. Heat rises and sets of the detector at a set temperature or if the temperature is rising very fast.) Double optical is very good at separating steam and smoke. (Use it in kitchens and locker rooms close too the showers. No problem with false alarms.) There are photoelectric and ionization sensors. One checks for flame and one checks for smoke. You have to be car because not all detectors have both. Photoelectric uses infrared light to see of there is smoke in the distance. Ionization sensors have two little plates that sense a break in ion flow, cause by smoldering of a flame. Smoke is technically a colloid of solid particles in an air medium. That makes it slightly more likely than steam to set off the sensors in a smoke detector, but if you shove a boiling pot of water right up against a detector, you have a small chance of setting it off. It would be more likely for dust to set it off. For example if you're removing drywall or if the detector is mounted on the wall and you dust it off after a long time. Smoke detectors work by having a small amount of Americium-241, a radioisotope, and a radiation detector. Smoke contains particulate matter which absorbs some of the radiation, the detector picks up on this and triggers the alarm. Steam doesn't absorb radiation as well so it doesn't trigger the alarm.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 54.02, 'recall': 12.95, 'fmeasure': 20.89}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 20.93, 'recall': 4.97, 'fmeasure': 8.04}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.89, 'recall': 7.16, 'fmeasure': 11.56}}"
What determines the type of batteries a toy or electronic would need? Why not have one universal?,"'What determines the type of batteries a toy or electronic would need?'

It's a bit of a complicated answer, but I'll try to break it down as simply as possible. The primary factors that determine the type of battery a toy or electronic would need are:

1. The device's power requirements. This is the amount of power the device requires to function. The higher the power requirements, the larger the battery needs to be.
2. The size of the device. Smaller devices can fit smaller batteries. Larger devices can fit larger batteries.
3. The lifespan of the device. Smaller batteries last longer. Larger batteries last less long.
4. The cost of the device. Smaller batteries are cheaper. Larger batteries are more expensive.
5. The type of power the device requires. Some devices require DC power, some require AC power.
6. The amount of current the device requires. Some devices require more current than others.

In terms of 'why not have one universal battery', there are a few reasons. Firstly, the power requirements of devices are different. For example, a toy car that runs on 1.5V requires a lot less power than a toy helicopter that runs on 3V. Secondly, the lifespan of devices is different.  ","Each device has different demands on size, voltage needed, and total charge desired. Most things you buy batteries for use alkaline batteries, or were made originally to use alkaline batteries. The chemistry of them means one cell generates 1.5V. If you need more voltage, you need more cells. If you've got the space and want it to last as long as possible, you'd want to use a larger battery (like a D battery in a flashlight). If you've got less space, you need to use a smaller one. AA in remote controls, even though C batteries (while huge) would last for a very long time. If you need more voltage, you need multiple batteries. It's pointless to produce an alkaline, 4-cell, 6-volt battery because it'd be about the same size as four 1.5V batteries, and would require manufacturing a whole other kind of battery with no real benefit. Far easier to sell only single-cell batteries, and just have some devices use more than one at a time. Between all these factors, there simply isn't a single kind/size battery that meets the needs of every device.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 33.97, 'recall': 36.04, 'fmeasure': 34.98}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.4, 'recall': 2.55, 'fmeasure': 2.48}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.83, 'recall': 15.74, 'fmeasure': 15.27}}"

Air flowing into the front of the engine exits the back at a much increased speed. This is why engines can generate thrust from a standstill. When ""target type"" thrust reversers are deployed, they redirect the flow of the gas exiting the engine to point it in the direction of travel, which results in reverse thrust and slowing of the aircraft. Regarding why they are used - several reasons. Firstly to reduce the wear on brakes, thus avoiding potential failures; secondly to reduce the landing distance; and thirdly to compensate for the negative effect of poor weather on braking efficiency.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 19.38, 'recall': 37.61, 'fmeasure': 25.58}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.42, 'recall': 8.62, 'fmeasure': 5.85}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 12.78, 'recall': 24.79, 'fmeasure': 16.86}}"
Why not construct concrete homes in the tornado alley instead of rebuilding every time?,1. Cost. Rebuilding a home is a lot cheaper than building a new one. 2.

It would also be very difficult to get people to live in a home that is constantly being hit by tornadoes and earthquakes.,"Cost, odds, and aesthetics. The odds of being hit by a tornado are very small - they aren't that wide and only touch down for a few miles, usually. So odds are a house isn't going to get a direct hit by a tornado. Then it is a question of cost and aesthetics. Since home builders and buyers know their house is very likely not going to be hit, they'll go with the house that is much cheaper - it means they can afford a bigger and nicer house (or just save on money). Also, while there are plenty of good looking, modern, high end concrete homes, if you don't have skilled concrete tradesmen, a concrete home can look ugly, or you'll just need more materials as a facade. It is more expensive to build a building capable of withstanding a tornado than it is to rebuild. Not for an individual house of course, but overall it balances out. Imagine every year 1% of houses are blown down by tornadoes and to build a house capable of withstanding such immense forces would make it cost 40% more. If you built every house to withstand a tornado you would spend about as much as simply replacing the houses which blow down every year for 40 years. Is the average lifespan of a house in that area more or less than 40 years? What if you took that 40% you might have spent on the house and invested it for 20 years, would you be able to rebuild the house that much more easily? So you see it isn't clear that sinking money into building for a relatively rare event is really that wise of a choice. Rare disasters are better dealt with through insurance rather than trying to make every structure ""everything-proof"". 1. It is statistically-unlikely that your house will suffer a direct hit from a tornado. So what's the point of constructing it out of more expensive materials specifically rated to withstand a statistically-unlikely event? 2. Building tornado-proof homes is more expensive than building weaker, wooden houses that insurance takes care of. 3. In most cases, it costs more to repair a damaged concrete house than it does to rebuild a destroyed wooden house. Most of the damage suffered by a house made primarily out of concrete is caused by destruction of windows, doors, and its roof. You ever see a house with a concrete roof? Me neither; they're more commonly called *bunkers*, and they're normally underground. Sometimes, you end up having to demolish the concrete structure anyways. Water does a lot of damage. Also damaging concrete buildings so you end up rebuilding a more costly home I still wonder why they put trailer parks in tornado zones. I understand that not everyone can afford a traditional house, but why allow them at all in places like Missouri and Oklahoma? It's not the same homes blowing down every year. You can guarantee you are safe by building a home that costs three times as much, or hedge your bets, and most likely come out ahead.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 45.37, 'recall': 18.6, 'fmeasure': 26.38}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.44, 'recall': 3.04, 'fmeasure': 4.32}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.0, 'recall': 10.25, 'fmeasure': 14.54}}"
How do sailboats / ancient ships steer if the wind isn't blowing in the direction they want to go?,"1) The wind direction is not always the same. 2) The sailboat has a keel, which is a fin running along the bottom of the hull. This fin will cause the boat to turn into the wind if it's not going in the same direction. 3) The sailboat will turn the sails into the wind and use the wind to turn the boat. 4) The sailboat will turn the sails out of the wind and use the wind to turn the boat. 5) The sailboat can turn the sails at an angle to the wind and use the wind to turn the boat. 6) The sailboat can turn the sails in a circle and use the wind to turn the boat. 7) The sailboat can turn the sails in a circle and use the wind to turn the boat. 8) The sailboat can turn the sails in a circle and use the wind to turn the boat. 9) The sailboat can turn the sails in a circle and use the wind to turn the boat. 10) The sailboat can turn the sails in a circle and use the wind to turn the boat. 11) The sailboat can turn the sails in a circle and use the wind to turn the boat.  ","A sail can catch wind and push the boat forward from just about any angle greater than 70 degrees from directly in to the wind. A sail boat has a big fin on the bottom that keeps it from being pushed sideways, and the sail is at an angle so the wind is redirected, which all together pushes the boat forward. So as long as the boat isn't going directly into the wind, it can often just sail straight forwards in the direction it wants to go. If the boat wants to travel in to the wind, then what the boat does is it picks up speed going across the wind, and then turns into the wind. While the boat is facing in to the wind, the sail is not catching the wind, so there is much less force trying to slow the boat down as it turns. AS the boat loses speed, it will turn far enough that it is going sideways to the wind again, but in the other direction- and once it picks up enough speed again, it will turn back in to the wind again, which creates a zig-zag pattern that slowly moves them in the direction they want to go. This is known as Tacking in to the wind. Depending on how close to directly in to the wind they want to go, they could just go in mostly the right direction, hoping that the wind will shift in their favor and then tack in to the wind to correct their position once in a while if the wind doesn't change. It's called tacking, and basically you zig zag using a portion of the wind to move in the direction you want... so if you were sailing directly into the wind you'd angle the sail so that it moves you up at a 45 degree angle, then switch and have to move you down at a 45 degree angle No one yet seems to have mentioned the keel. The keel runs from the front to the back of a boat. The wind, when from the side, just wants to blow the boat sideways, it is the keel that stops that from happening and thus the boat is sort of ""squeezed"" forwards a bit like when you squeeze a toothpaste tube. The toothpaste is channelled by the sides into coming out the front.

Why did drones start exploding in popularity ~2 years ago? What technological advancement happened that allowed them to be accessible to consumers?," _______________________________________ There are several reasons why drones started exploding in popularity. Firstly, the cost of drones has decreased significantly over the last few years. Drones were originally very expensive and only used by companies and hobbyists. However, nowadays you can buy a decent drone for a few hundred dollars. Secondly, drones have become more accessible to the general public. There are many apps and websites that make it easy for people to buy drones. Thirdly, drones have become more advanced. Drones are now equipped with many advanced features such as GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and other sensors that allow them to fly more accurately and for longer periods of time. Furthermore, drones have become more efficient and can fly for longer periods of time without needing to recharge. The most important factor is the advancement in battery technology. Lithium-ion batteries have become more efficient and more affordable. This allowed drones to fly for longer periods of time and have more advanced features. The main reason is the advancement in battery technology. The cost of batteries has decreased and the energy density has increased. This means that the drones can fly for longer periods of time and be equipped with more advanced features.  ","The thing that made them explode was auto stabilization, specifically the prevalence of easy to program PID controllers. Before then you couldn't just hook 4 motors up to a magic box and download one file to have it work. You had to custom design each drone and then custom design a stabilizing algorithm. So simply put drones took off because they became very easy to program and design. solid state gyroscopes and inexpensive use of PID loops to allow single chip/board solutions to complex mechanics like balancing or stabilizing. If you think back to the world before things like the Segway or hoverboards, solid state stability controls used to be rarer in consumer goods. But as they got smaller, cheaper, and lower powered, you started seeing them pop up in laptops to park the hard disk when dropped, cellphones and game controllers as input devices, even in toys. Prior to these electronic solutions, products often had mechanical solutions such as helicopter flybars. Back around 2000 radio control helis mostly used weighted bars to stabilize them, and tail gyroscopes were just coming on the market in mass quantities. Today you find inexpensive boards with 3 axis gyro stabilization such as what you would need to operate a quad copter. PID loops could have their own ELI5 writeup that would be exhausting to read but those are the broad strokes.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 23.38, 'recall': 20.43, 'fmeasure': 21.81}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.5, 'recall': 1.31, 'fmeasure': 1.4}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 12.44, 'recall': 10.87, 'fmeasure': 11.6}}"
"If 10% of accidents are caused by wet roadways, why can't we create a tire type that doesnt hydroplane and is easily fitted for all vehicle types?","Љ The question is a bit tricky, as it is asking why something is not done when it is actually being done. There are actually a number of tire designs that are resistant to hydroplaning. However, it is generally not practical to put these designs on all vehicles, because they are heavier and more expensive. For example, the tires on a semi truck are designed to be resistant to hydroplaning, but they are not used on cars because they are too heavy and expensive. The reason why this is done is that the tires on cars are designed to be lightweight and affordable, which makes them more likely to hydroplane. The reason why cars are more likely to hydroplane is that they are lighter than trucks, which makes them more likely to be affected by the force of the water. This is why it is important to drive slowly in the rain, so that you can avoid hydroplaning.","Because we need to have tyres that work in all weather conditions, including completely dry roads. Producing a rubber compound that was super effective in wet conditions would likely involve a fairly soft tyre surface with loads of grooves to disperse water - if that tyre were driven on dry roads, it would introduce a lot of vibration from the grooves, and the rubber compound would break down, dramatically shortening the life of the tyre. /u/togoboldly has the right idea with his response, however I'd like to go a bit deeper. Keep in mind, the contact patch (area that connects tire and ground) is roughly just a tad bit bigger than a grown mans hand laid flat. **What causes a tire to lose effectiveness or hydroplane in wet conditions?** When it's raining, water forms on roads. And some of it stays on top of it. Now, you remember as a kid when you were playing in a tub or pool, pushing water on the surface to create tiny waves? That's what an ungrooved tire surface is basically doing. It's pushing water away from it, and by rotating also pushing it under it. Water is a nasty bugger because it doesn't compress, and many a wonders of modern world use this to their advantage. **Alright great, so we just gotta do grooved tires, right? Can't be that hard!** Well, yes and no. There is a lot of research going on all the time by the top manufacturers, on how to optimise the tire performance. They come up with shapes and compounds which they test through. Very popular way of shaping the tires has been the upsidedown V shape. It catches the water that is supposed to go under the tire inside the groove, and pushes it to the sides and out.**THIS IS ALSO THE REASON WHY ITS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE ROLL DIRECTION, WHEN YOU INSTALL NEW TIRES**. If you'd mount up a tire with the V going wrong direction, it would CATCH that water and push it under the tire. Not good. Unless you want to turn your car into a sled. The thing with grooves is, it adds edges. And edges adds friction. It isn't bad to have friction on tire, but too much of it and you get noise (annoying as hell), vibration (also annoying, but wears your car a lot), decreased fuel economy (Which is a big factor in consumer tires) and tire wear. Some of these can be battled with changing the tire compound a bit, but there is a limit. Too soft, it wears out and is noisy. Too hard, it has no grip, dry or wet. So believe me, there are tons of engineers working on the best possible solution. Here in Finland, our roads are very coarse, and we have snow and ice at least 3-4 months a year. Maybe 2 dry months and the rest is wet as fuck. Police are super strict on the tires and you can get a fine that is a % of your income, which can rack up to hundreds of euros. The reason is simple, public safety. Here is a great image about how the tire wear affects the amount of grip: [Link]( URL_0 ) It is in Finnish, sorry for that, but it gives you the idea. Leftside column is speed, top column is the amount of millimeters in groove depth. Minimum required depth in Finland is 5/32 inches or 4mm. Quite fucking scary, when you think that that's the only thing trying to get your car where you want it, instead of sliding around. There are such tyres already, but they are unsuitable for dry conditions. A standard tyre is a compromise - its not the most performant in the dry, nor the wet. It would be up to the driver to adjust their driving to the conditions - which I suspect is the real culprit behind your '10% of accidents are caused by wet roadways' statistic We can't fix the fleshy thing behind the wheel that either chooses to ignore the necessity to replace it, or is too ignorant to know otherwise. I just drove around the other day in a car where the back wheel locks up because the slave cylinder is malfunctioning. I didn't crash into anything. People fail to take appropriate action, and caution, when driving. They fail to learn what is required to remain safe. They fail to plan ahead to avoid issues. It's not the tire, or the engineer, or the material, or anything else but the fault of the driver.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.15, 'recall': 12.34, 'fmeasure': 20.53}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.82, 'recall': 2.57, 'fmeasure': 4.29}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.85, 'recall': 6.43, 'fmeasure': 10.7}}"

What is codeless/semi-codeless GPS and how will turning it off affect current GPS devices and service?,"Codeless GPS is a GPS system that does not use a traditional GPS receiver and transmitter.

Instead, it uses the GPS satellite signals to determine its location and then transmits that information to a central database.   its location. Instead, it uses the GPS satellite signals to determine its location and then transmits that information to a central database.  ","GPS works by transmitting a very precise time signal for multiple satellites. Because the distance from each satellite to the receiver is different, the signals come in at different times, and the receiver can use the time discrepancies between the multiple signals to work out its position. The GPS signal from each satellite consists of a repeated code - this is a long string of binary numbers that look random. The advantage of this is that most digits of the code provide a clear timing signal - so when a 0 in the code is followed by a 1, there is a big change in the signal. Because the code is about 1000 digits long and repeats about 1000 times per second, the receiver can average the timing signal from each digit and each repetition, to get a very clear measure of the timing. As well as the civilian signal transmitted on the L1 band, GPS also transmits an encrypted military signal on a separate frequency. The 2nd frequency (L2) is useful because it allows the receiver to calculate the effect of atmospheric conditions on the signal for improved accuracy. (Atmospheric delay affects one frequency more than the other, so if you can measure the time difference between the two signals from one satellite, you can calculate the effect of the atmosphere). However, dual frequency receivers have a problem: the military signal has an encrypted code, and because the receiver doesn't know the code, the receiver can't just average the signal to try to extract the timing. Because using dual frequency signals improved accuracy, very high end GPS systems intended for scientific use or surveying, have developed some clever tricks to try to extract timing information from the military signal. The original technique for this was ""codeless"". It used signal processing techniques without any knowledge of the code. This is difficult, because the code identifies each satellite, so with no code information, it's a problem telling one satellite from another, so the system may not always work. The codeless timing signal is also very weak and therefore the extra accuracy over regular GPS is often dissapointing, and this technique has been completely obsolete for about 10 years. A more advanced ""semicodeless"" system was developed which takes advantage of the fact that a copy of the same military signal is also transmitted on the L1 band. By using the L1 copy of the military signal as a reference, it becomes possible to measure the time difference to the L2 signal, even if you can't actually read the code itself. This time delay is all that is needed for atmosphere correction. The GPS signals are being modernised. One of the key upgrades is to have fully open dual and triple frequency signals for civilian use. There will be no need for semicodeless trickery to get atmosphere correction, because the updated signals will have a public code allowing them to be directly decoded. A public L2 (called L2C) signal is already partially active, and should be fully active by 2020. There is also a public L5 signal coming giving a 3rd signal choice. Satellites with L5 signal will be launched starting next year, and the signal should be fully active by 2024. The new signals won't be received by old receivers using codeless/semicodeless processing of the old L2 military signal, and when the old military signal is switched off (once the new civilian GPS signals are fully active), then these GPS units will not be able to operate in codeless/semicodeless mode. Users of old codeless/semicodeless systems are being given advanced warning to start planning upgrades to a new modern unit capable of receiving the new dual/triple frequency civilian signals.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 51.16, 'recall': 10.59, 'fmeasure': 17.55}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.69, 'recall': 0.96, 'fmeasure': 1.6}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.46, 'recall': 6.1, 'fmeasure': 10.11}}"

The simplest ones use particulate filters that prevent large particles floating in the air (like dust, chemical powders, or smoke) from getting through. There are also chemical filters that form chemical bonds with harmful compounds and trap them in the filter. The most common chemical filtering agent is activated charcoal, which is effective against most organic molecules. Some masks also utilize filters that directly react with airborne chemicals and render them inert. What kind of mask you decide to use depends on what you're trying to filter out. Masks designed to deal with a wide range of NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) threats use filter canisters that contain several different kinds of filter, but tend to be quite restrictive of airflow.

"If a nuclear bomb is dropped on other nuclear bombs that are idle on the ground, will it create a double explosion or do these weapons need to become 'activated' in order for them to be able to detonate?"," Sounds like a nuclear bomb. But it's actually a question about what happens when a nuclear bomb is dropped on a nuclear bomb. The answer is that it doesn't do anything. A nuclear bomb is just a very powerful bomb, but it needs to be detonated. If you just drop a nuclear bomb on the ground, it won't do anything. It needs to be activated.","Depends on a lot of things. Nuclear bombs work by changing the critical mass of the nuclear fuel. ""Critical mass"" is the amount of nuclear material you need to have a sustained nuclear reaction. You can artificially make a smaller-than-critical mass into a critical mass in several ways. One way is to cover it with a material that reflects neutrons (which would cause all the neutrons that would've escaped outwards from the material to reflect back inwards, generally used in nuclear reactors and research), but another way is to change the temperature and pressure of the material (which is done in nuclear weapons by using ""explosive lenses"" which is a fancy way of saying you surround it with conventional explosives). Without those explosives going off (and a few other things I'd guess) that nuclear weapon isn't actually fissile (able to undergo fission). A nuclear explosion above the silo where the bombs are stored is just as likely to vaporize the exposive as anything else, not to mention that unless that explosion is able to actually trigger the explosive correctly it's not going to explode. (C4 and TNT for example are completely safe to burn, and only explode with specific stimulii.) Detonating a nuclear bomb is a very precise process, a lot of complicated things have to happen in just the right order. Even the most primitive bombs would be unlikely to go off in a high order explosion just because of a nearby explosion, nuclear or not. Modern nuclear weapons are actually deliberately designed so this is impossible, as a safety measure. Nuclear weapons are conceptually simple, you smash together enough U-235 (a 'supercritical mass') and it goes boom. The hard part is making it go boom when you want it to, and NOT melt when it's sitting in a silo. There are two kinds of 'explosions' that occur in a nuclear weapon. The most obvious one is the nuclear fission chain reaction that makes a nuke what it is, which I'll call 'nuclear detonation'. The second kind of explosion (technically the first to happen) is what I'll call a 'primary detonation', which is a bunch of high explosives rigged precisely to trigger or 'ignite' the big boom. There are two main ways in which these parts are put together, the 'Gun' and the 'implosion' methods. In the gun device, a big slug of U-235 is shot at high speed into another mass of U-235 that fits it like a glove, bringing together a supercritical mass. This device was constructed during the Manhattan Project by essentially strapping a bunch of expensive equipment and U-235 to an artillery piece and firing it. The second method uses a hollow sphere (also known as a pit) made of Uranium. In its hollow shape, the mass is not supercritical, but when it is compressed by the primary detonation into a solid ball, the mass becomes supercritical. It's a lot like crushing a soda can, but your hands are TNT and the soda can is going to blow your block party off the map. In both methods of detonation, the critical mass must be brought together very quickly and very precisely. Otherwise, instead of the desired nuclear ignition, a 'premature detonation' will occur, severely reducing the weapon's power (loads better for the world than premature ejaculation ;). So, to answer the question, if a nuclear warhead were dropped on a warehouse full of nukes, it would NOT cause nuclear detonations in the other weapons. It would, however, cause lots of bad shit, including: -Big Boom from the original warhead -All of the nuclear materials in the bombs is now volatile nuclear waste that may be in various states of criticality and may or may not fissioning and creating more hazardous waste. To get an idea of what this could develop into in the worst case scenario, read up on the elephant's foot at Chernobyl. Its not exactly the same situation, but Chernobyl gives us an idea of how difficult it is to move and protect ourselves from uncontained fission materials. -Detonation of high explosives from primary detonation systems of other bombs. This is unlikely to cause any nuclear detonations because the precision of the detonation is completely overwhelmed by the initial warhead, but explosives are explosives. TBH the size of these explosions is nothing compared to the initial weapon's power, and amounts to something like a mosquito bite on an arm that a bear just tore off of you. -WWIII (Assuming some head-ass didn't bomb their own country, which almost happened once in North Carolina I think) TL;DR: No, it won't cause a 'Double Explosion', but it's still a nuke, and it's gonna kill the heck out of you. Side note: For similar reasons, nuking or crashing a plane into a nuclear power plant does not cause a nuclear detonation. Nuclear weapons are devices carefully orchestrated and calibrated to 'make the stars align' so to speak, and create the very narrow conditions that make a nuclear explosion possible. On the other hand, a power plant is designed to generate electricity in a sustained and controlled fashion, which inherently precludes the possibility of a nuclear detonation, simply because the specifications on how to trigger a nuclear detonation are so tight.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 73.53, 'recall': 5.58, 'fmeasure': 10.37}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 25.37, 'recall': 1.9, 'fmeasure': 3.53}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 48.53, 'recall': 3.68, 'fmeasure': 6.85}}"

The camera was on a crane and they used a dolly to move it around to create the effect of the camera moving around the building.

Another part is that it appears that frames have been removed from the scene, making things appear much more frantic.

In most movies when the fighting happens they tend to cut at or before the attack hits and switch to a different angle to make the attack looks like it hit but it actually didn't in real life.

"Is it more efficient to leave the AC running on auto at 74F (in 85 degree whether) or turning it off when leaving the house, and turning it back on when returning when the ambient temp in the apartment is 85?", TL;DR: How to save money on electricity bill by using AC more efficiently. 1. Let's say you have a 2000 square foot house. 2. You set the AC to 74 degrees. 3. You leave the house and the AC runs until the temperature in the house reaches 85 degrees. 4. You come back home and turn the AC back on. 5. The AC runs until the temperature in the house reaches 74 degrees. 6. You go out again. 7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you come back home. 8. Turn the AC off. 9. The AC runs for 30 minutes to cool the house down to 74 degrees. 10. Turn the AC back on. 11. The AC runs until the temperature in the house reaches 85 degrees. 12. You go out again. 13. Repeat steps 4-12. 14. Turn the AC off. 15. The AC runs for 30 minutes to cool the house down to 74 degrees. 16. Turn the AC back on. 17. The AC runs until the temperature in the house reaches 85 degrees. 18. You go out again. 19. Repeat steps 4-18. 20.,"Turn it off, you will use less power. Thermodynamics tells us that heat loss is proportional to temperature difference, so if you let your house warm up the heat from outside enters more slowly. Essentially the product of time and temperature difference is your cooling energy. There is a minor subtlety with maintenance and life cycle, your AC unit may not be designed for continuous duty, so long cool down cycles could be hard on it. Not sure if that is the case in your unit, seems like a bad way to design anything but it could be. Edit: one non-thermodynamic factor is humidity and mold, which will be different at a constant temperature vs a cycling temperature. Turning it off would be more energy efficient. The reason why this is, is that running your A/C at a cooler temp doesn't necessarily use ""more power"". As an example, suppose you have an 1100w microwave. That microwave will on average, always use 1100w no matter if you're cooking for 10 seconds or 5 minutes. If you cook for 1 hour, you will have used 1.1 kWh. If you multiply that by 24 you will have the kilowatt per day, supposing you ran it for 24 hours. Multiply that by 1/4th of the year, 91 days, and you'd have used ~2049kWh of round the clock microwaving (Many home owners use between 3,000kWh and 20,000kWh when yearly home electrical use is totaled). The same concept applies to your A/C (can usually use 500w to > 2000w (2kWh)). So, your A/C will just run longer because your thermostat will be trying to keep your house at that temp. Depending on the placement of your thermostat, it may be in an abnormally warmer part of your house and just be unable to detect the temperature properly. Meanwhile, all the bed rooms may be a comfortable or colder temp. Not to sell a product, but getting something like a smart thermostat would probably help a lot. They are a step up from a normal thermostat in that you can control some of them via your phone. You could leave the house at your usual time, A/C off, and then if you remember, can turn it on via phone before you're expected to come home so that your house will be chilled a little bit when you get there. Some of them have really robust means of scheduling them but anytime you don't have to run your A/C, you'd be more efficient than just running it all the time at a consistent temperature. You would save more money by turning it off when possible. Additionally, if you're paying a lot for A/C it may be a good idea to look into reducing your electrical bill by replacing it with a solar bill or see if there are more efficient AC* units. Final Edit: Clarity. For what you describe, assuming an apartment or small home, it is more efficient and safe on the equipment to turn it off through the day. Be sure you close the blinds or curtains to help keep it from warming too much during the day. Buy a programmable thermostat so it can cool your home only when you are there, and only down to the temperatures you need. Good devices ($50 range) can calculate how early to start cooling when you return home and run for multiple cooling cycles so it can minimize both cost and wear on the equipment. (No need for the very expensive learning-style devices unless you are truly incompetent at following on-screen instructions, although they seem to make neat toys for people who have money for them. Programming when you're up and about isn't hard. ) For an outdoor temperature of 85F -- which really is not very hot outside -- there is only a small temperature drop needed. Blocking light through windows and double-checking the insulation and weather seals will be your biggest help both for efficiency and cost. Assuming you closed the blinds and curtains during the day the weather you describe your home is unlikely to hit high temperatures, likely never hitting the same 85F you see outdoors. You're probably only going to cool the home 5F or so. In the general case it is a more complex answer, and it depends on the type of equipment, the difference between indoor temperature ranges and the outdoor temperature. It depends on the volume of air, a 30000 cubic foot larger home is quite different from an 7000 cubic foot apartment. It depends on how ducts are situated, if they are whole-home or zoned. There are some newer systems designed to run more continuously with slower fan speeds, and there are higher capacity HVAC systems for bigger volumes and large homes, but neither sound like your setup. Also zoned systems can require less power, but they're uncommon. Most homes are set up for whole-home cooling, so if the room opens up to the main area the duct vents and doors should remain open to prevent frosty-cold vents with hot rooms, or inconsistent temps between rooms. Most AC units work well at cooling for a block of time but not continuous duty. Running for extended times has hazards like the lines freezing up which can lead to expensive repairs, but that mostly happens for bigger temperature drops or high volumes of air to be cooled, or when there is a small temperature differential with the outside air. Efficient systems will run for five or ten minutes, long enough to get the refrigerant flowing in a strong pattern through the various systems to deliver cold air to the blower, and the blower will take that very cold air and blow it powerfully through the entire home. Then they'll shut off before the systems start to overheat or before any of the lines approach freezing temperatures. But really, most of the mid-grade or better programmable systems have all the brains to work this stuff out. You can tell it you're out for the day, and return at 6:00 PM, and it will sort everything out. Also, 74 degrees is way too cold. My home is set at 78 or 79 most of the summer. Your bill will go down drastically if you set it higher. It depends. If it is slow to pull down, leave it on. If it isn’t, then turn it on when you need it or have it come on before you come home with a programmable thermostat or remote controller like a Trane Nexia. Keep it on. Temperature is not the only issue here. Humidity in the air is so crucial. If you turn it off, the AC unit has to constantly pull the humidity out of the air and uses a lot of energy. It also stresses the equipment. I once read a comment by an air conditioning repair man that was very flustered by the idea of turning it off to save energy, because AC units are not designed to run for long periods of time (85F - > 74F), and are instead designed to maintain the temperature by running for short periods of time. Yes, you will save on electricity to turn it off during the day but a better option would to be to get a programmable thermostat and have that installed. You can set it to go up when you leave and to be nice and cool when you get home. It would be more convenient and better for the A/C. They're designed to run a certain amount of time and if they don't you could get mold all in your ductwork. Hope this will be okay to post as it is slightly related. If you have a 2 story house or more rotate your vents for the different seasons. What I mean by this is during the summer close all downstairs forcing the cooler air upstairs and allowing it to move downstairs this will create a more steady temperature throughout the entire house and upstairs will feel cooler so you aren't trying to run the AC all the time to try to cool the upstairs where you most likely sleep. Alternatively during the winter close your upstairs vents to push all the warm air downstairs again allowing it to move upstairs maintaining a more steady temperature. If you don't do this you may notice that in the summer upstairs is always hot and in the winter downstairs is always cold. Forcing you to run your AC and furnace longer and more often. Everything in your home is at a certain temperature. When you turn off your AC, not just the air warms and gains humidity, but also all of your building materials, finishes, and furniture. In order to recool your home, the heat energy and humidity has to be removed from all of this mass as well as the air. If you live in a wood framed structure, temperature and humidity are going to shrink and swell the skeleton of the building. This causes problems with Sheetrock, door swelling and not shutting correctly, window frames may even move and slightly break seals. This ruins the efficiency of the structure. Your HVAC system is just one part of the entire dwelling. It prevents nail pops, creaking floors, mold or mildew, and improves air quality. Turning the AC up a few degrees while you are away is not detrimental, but off will have a negative effect on all of the other systems in the structure.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.05, 'recall': 7.19, 'fmeasure': 12.86}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.81, 'recall': 1.74, 'fmeasure': 3.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 36.32, 'recall': 4.28, 'fmeasure': 7.65}}"
why does it take 4 years for repairs on Big Ben clock in London?," PART 1
Big Ben is a bell, not a clock. It is one of the five bells that make up the Great Bell of Westminster, which is housed in the Elizabeth Tower of the Palace of Westminster in London, England. The Great Bell is also commonly known as Big Ben. Big Ben is a very large four-faced chiming clock located in the north-west corner of the Palace of Westminster in London, England, and is considered to be one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. It is the largest four-faced chiming clock in the world and is famous for its accuracy and distinctive chimes. The clock is officially known as the ""Great Clock of Westminster"" and is often referred to as ""Big Ben"" or ""Big Ben the Bell"". It was built by the clockmaker Edward John Dent and was completed in 1859. Big Ben has four faces, each of which is 7 feet in diameter. It is powered by a large pendulum clock, which is located beneath the clock face. Big Ben is famous for its distinctive chimes, which are played every hour on the hour. The clock is powered by a large weight that is suspended from the clock tower. The weight is pulled down by a cable, which is attached to a pulley.  ","They're doing a lot of work. Work, especially work on an old listed masonry building, takes time. They're not just working on the clock face and mechanism—though they are doing that—they're also adding a lift to a building that was never designed to have one, retrofitting and repairing the masonry, replacing the lighting, and more. And all of that is being done to what is probably the most recognizable structure in the UK, which means it needs to be done carefully and thus relatively slowly.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 16.44, 'recall': 40.0, 'fmeasure': 23.3}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.13, 'recall': 10.11, 'fmeasure': 5.86}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 9.13, 'recall': 22.22, 'fmeasure': 12.94}}"
"How does Dolby Atmosphere ""Place"" sound?","It's a combination of different things. First, it's a new codec that compresses the audio file and then decompresses it on the receiver side. This allows for more channels of audio to be compressed. It also has a new audio format that allows for more channels of audio to be transmitted. It also has new algorithms that allow for audio to be placed in space. This is done by analyzing the audio signal and then placing it in a 3D space. The receiver then uses this information to play the audio in the correct position in the room. This is done by using a series of speakers that are placed in the room. These speakers are then used to create the 3D space. The receiver then uses the information from the codec and the audio signal to place the audio in the correct position in the room.","The first idea to think about is, how can you tell what direction a sound is coming from? Snap your fingers to the right of your head. Now snap your fingers to the left of your head. [Even if your eyes were closed]( URL_1 ), you would be able to tell which direction the sound was coming from. This is due to **time of arrival differences** of the sound waves. The sound hits one ear or the other milliseconds before the other. Your brain interprets those time of arrival differences and figures out which direction the sound is coming from. With two speakers, or headphones, this is used to make sound appear to come from the far left, panning all the way through the center to the far right. There is no effect to produce ""depth"" using only two speakers. In the 70's, you began to see quadraphonic systems being sold: 4 speakers. This lets the audio engineers pan forward/back in addition to left/right. Quadraphonic setups are better known today as surround sound, where it's not 4 speakers but 5 plus a subwoofer: 5.1. Or 7.1. So, if it's one speaker, you cannot produce a depth effect, except for something like [reverb]( URL_0 ) or echo, which is a different perception.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 34.9, 'recall': 23.85, 'fmeasure': 28.34}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.41, 'recall': 3.69, 'fmeasure': 4.38}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.79, 'recall': 12.84, 'fmeasure': 15.26}}"
Why do big lorries/trucks have wheels that are an inch off the road and don't do anything?,հայտնել ուսուցման են այդ տրականներ.  ,"Typically large dump trucks and dump trailers have what we call drop axles. They can be raised or lowered depending on whether the truck is loaded or not. When it’s unloaded, most truckers raise those wheels up, as it makes it easier to turn the truck around corners. When the truck is loaded, they lower the axle so it takes a share of the overall weight of the load. Many states have laws governing how much weight can be supported by each axle. Using the drop axle when loaded serves to distribute the weight over 3 axles, instead of 2 (or 4 axles, instead of 3, or 5 axles...etc.) The extra tires (or, well, axles, actually) are not spare. They are there for when the trailer carries it full load capacity. You see, road taxes are paid for heavy machinery and trucks according to the axle pressure. (which is a fancy way to say ""for how heavy one axle can be"") And added to that, every road has a stated maximum allowed axle pressure. Which means that if you want to be able to load to maximum capacity and still be allowed to use the road you have to have a minimum number of axles to even out the weight between. And it could have stopped there, if it wasn't for the less practicality of having all axles in the ground. All those axles being in the ground at the same time makes it harder to negotiate a turn. The trailer will kind of prefer to carry on forward. The wheels will leave ugly rubber marks (that, if you want to be blunt, remove life span from the tires) and it's just not possible to make the same narrow turn that you would have wanted. So for that reason, you can lift up the extra axles. The axles that remain in the ground permanently are only those that are needed to legally and practically carry the weight of the empty trailer. The machine transport trailers that carries excavator machinery also sometimes have to lift an axle or two to be able to pass rural railroad crossings, but that is mainly because the trailer is very low and the axles are on the front and back end of the trailer. But that is probably beyond the scope of your question. Load the trailer, and you'll have to drop an axle. Load more and you'll have to drop another. And so on. But lift them again when you don't need them, and it will be a bit easier to drive the damn thing. It might be worth noting that even if you have hydraulic steering on one of these extra axles, and thus get extra maneuvering help in a tight spot, you would still probably typically want to lift the extra axle when you are without load to reduce wear on the tires and gain fuel economy when driving forward. Generally, these trucks are empty. When they are full and heavier, the trailers sit lower and the floating wheels touch the ground, providing more support for the truck.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 0.0, 'recall': 0.0, 'fmeasure': 0.0}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.0, 'recall': 0.0, 'fmeasure': 0.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 0, 'recall': 0, 'fmeasure': 0}}"
How do spiders get their strands of silk sometimes 20 feet connecting high structures? Do they really walk one end that far across the ground?,"I've been trying to figure out how spiders make their webs for years. I have no idea how they can throw silk from so far away, and   a spider carry a strand of silk that is more than 20 feet long. I've also noticed that spiders don't seem to throw silk from their bodies. They throw it from their spinnerets. They don't throw it from their mouths.   a spider walk a strand of silk across the ground. They don't seem to need to. Spiders are notoriously lazy. They don't seem to be able to lift their own bodies, so they don't seem to be able to lift a strand of silk. I think they probably throw the silk and then pull it back towards them. They probably don't throw it from a distance. They probably throw it from very close to their bodies. I think spiders probably have some kind of sticky substance that they can use to attach their silk to whatever they are throwing it at. I don't know how they do it.

","Because the area inside the water that the boat takes up - including the volume of air *inside* the boat - weighs less than a volume of water of that same size. The air that's inside the boat weighs less than water, so it counters the metal parts of the boat that weighs more than the same volume of water. If you just crumpled a boat down into a ball of metal, that wouldn't float, because then it would be denser than water on average and thus would sink. The boat *plus the air* isn't denser than water on average, which is why it floats. This is why when a boat fills up with water, it usually sinks - because then the metal frame of the boat plus the water inside of it overall is denser than an amount of water equal to the size of the boat, since the metal parts are denser than water while the water inside the boat is just as dense as water (obviously). This is due to displacement and bouyancy. Something will float if it weighs less than an equivalent amount of water - so a block of wood or polystyrene weighs less than a block of water of the same size and it floats, while a block of steel or concrete weighs far more than the same size block of water and it sinks. With vista we figured out that the material does not need to be solid - a hollow cube of steel weighs far less than a solid one, and boats work on this principle. If you add up the weight of the hull of a boat and all of the air inside it, this will weigh less in total than the same volume of water, because the really light air offsets the heavier steel when you average then out. It does sound crazy that this works when you talk about supertankers and cargo ships weighing hundreds of thousands of tonnes, but because they are so huge and displace so much water, the weight of the equivalent volume of water is even more and they still float.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 42.39, 'recall': 22.03, 'fmeasure': 29.0}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.56, 'recall': 3.4, 'fmeasure': 4.48}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.78, 'recall': 18.08, 'fmeasure': 23.79}}"
How exactly do arm prosthetics work?,"There are two main types of prosthetics. One is a body-powered prosthetic, and the other is a myoelectric prosthetic.

","There are many different kinds of power plants with different performance characteristics, and they're used in combination to ensure that the supply of electricity matches the demand as demand changes throughout the day. In one group, you have the ""base load"" power plants. These are typically things like large coal and nuclear plants that produce electricity very cheaply, but need to run at 100% production all the time, and take a long time to turn on or off (on the order of several hours up to several days). These just run at 100% production all the time. Next you have the ""peaking"" power plants. These are typically natural gas plants that produce electricity more expensively, but can be turned on and off quite quickly (sometimes within a few minutes). These are used to handle the times of highest demand, and only run for a few hours a day, if that. Finally, you have ""load following"" power plants. These are plants that can modulate their output to ensure that the right amount of power is available when it's needed. There are a lot of different kinds of plants that can do this, though sometimes they have to have some modifications from the standard design to allow load following operation. These are used to handle the fluctuations in demand outside of peak hours, when they'll be running at full output and the peaking plants will be used to produce the extra supply necessary.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 31.55, 'recall': 24.18, 'fmeasure': 27.38}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.3, 'recall': 3.29, 'fmeasure': 3.73}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.93, 'recall': 16.8, 'fmeasure': 19.03}}"
"Why does every university have their own referencing style, why has there not been an effort to standardise referencing?","There are a few reasons for this. First, it's important to understand what the referencing style is for. There are two types of referencing styles: citation and annotation. Citation referencing styles are used to provide a reference to the source of information. This is the most common type of referencing style. Annotation referencing styles are used to provide a brief summary of the source of information. This is less common, but it is used in some fields. Now, there are a few reasons why there are multiple referencing styles. First, there are multiple languages. The reference style for each language is different. For example, the reference style for English is different from the reference style for Spanish. This means that the referencing style for each language has to be different. Second, there are different fields. Different fields have different requirements for referencing. For example, in the field of history, the referencing style is different than in the field of physics. This means that the referencing style for each field has to be different. Third, there are different systems. For example, there are different systems for referencing sources. There are systems for referencing sources in books, systems for referencing sources in journals, and systems for referencing sources on the internet. Each of these systems is different. Finally, there are different people. People have different opinions about how to reference sources. This means that there are different referencing styles.",Because it's not that important.

","Speed bumps are intended to force drivers to slow their speed. Most are designed in such a way to make it uncomfortable for the driver to take them too fast, but are not intended to damage their vehicle. Others are poorly designed and *will* damage the vehicle, even at a reasonable speed. Even properly designed speed bumps can damage a vehicle if the vehicle is going much too fast, though. The wear and tear you experience going over a speed bump is negligible. You'll experience more wear and tear through simple road driving because you do more road driving than you spend time driving over speed bumps. Thing to remember about speed bumps is this: the speed that it is safest to driver over the speed bump is the speed you are supposed to be driving on the road even where there are no speed bumps. If you are going 45 mph, then slow down to 25 mph to go over the speed bump, accelerate back up to 45, slow down to 25, again to go over the next speed bump, you are doing it wrong. You should be traveling 25 up to the speed bump, over the speed bump and between the speed bump. The city likely placed the speed bump on that road because drivers are travelling that road too fast. Some are, yes. We have the normal speed bumps but there is a whole road nearby that uses ~~his~~ these rubber things bolted down and even if you are going really slowly the jolt they give you is enormous. In portuguese, speed bumps are called ""quebra-molas"". roughly translated, it means ""suspension-breaker"". So yes, I think so. every time you drive your car, yes, the suspension will suffer wear & tear. If you hit bumps like they weren't there, you will just wear out the suspension a bit sooner. If you hit them too fast, the suspension will pack down and you risk smacking the front plastics of the car into the ground. Properly shaped and sized speed bumps shouldn't do any damage as long as you slow down enough. Most speed bumps should be driven over at less than 20mph. No, speed bumps are designed so that if *you* drive over them too fast, *you* will damage your car. Square edge bumps (rough roads, potholes) will wear your suspension out faster than speed bumps because these are felt as impacts that are transmitted to the bushings in your suspension. Speed bumps are smooth, they are soaked up by the normal travel of suspension and are not jarring impacts. As long as you are not bottoming out your suspension by going over them too fast (felt as a clunk) they will not hurt your car.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 1.06, 'recall': 2.17, 'fmeasure': 1.42}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.0, 'recall': 0.0, 'fmeasure': 0.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 1.06, 'recall': 2.17, 'fmeasure': 1.42}}"

How does “cracking” a safe actually work? The kind where headphones are worn and every turn of the knob is carefully listened to.,"You can't really ""crack"" a safe, you can crack a code. A safe is a box with a lock on it. The lock is designed to keep the contents of the box from being accessed unless the correct code is entered. The code is typically a series of numbers or letters. The lock can be picked, or the combination can be figured out. The headphones are a tool that allows the person cracking the safe to hear the sounds of the lock as it is being opened. The lock will make a different sound when it is turned in different ways. The person wearing the headphones can use those sounds to figure out the combination.","When you turn the knob of the safe, you can hear the mechanism ""tick"" when the wheels touch. This enables you to use the dial to measure how far you are turning each wheel. By putting torque on the opening handle, you can measure or hear (depending on the design) the gap in the wheel that allows the safe to open. The technique is specific to the design of the lock mechanism, and it can easily take hours. [This cool animation]( URL_0 ) shows how the mechanism works. [Here's some pictures of a lock I have]( URL_1 ), a S & G 6730-MP. A lock specifically designed to resist the type of attack you're talking about. A safe lock contains a pack of 4+ wheels, each with a slot cut in them. The last wheel (topmost silver one, called a cam) has more of a sloped cut in it called a cam gate. These are mounted on bearings that fit over the rod the dial connects to. There's a piece of metal in there--a bar with a hooked end. This is the lever and the bar is called a fence. This is connected to the latch that locks the safe bolts in place. The safe bolts are the giant locking bars that stick out of the edges of the door. If you dial the correct combination, slots in the wheels align. Then you rotate the dial until the cam gate engages the hooked end of the lever. It can only do this completely if the bar can fall all the way through the slots cut in the wheels. Further rotation of the dial will then pull the lever and retract the latch, freeing the bolt. The cam is directly connected to the dial and the cam gate is at a known position, usually near zero. So the procedure to open a safe will be to dial your combination thus aligning the regular wheels. Then you turn the dial past zero, the location of the cam gate. If the combination is correct, the lever engages in the cam gate and pulls open the latch. Lock manipulation consists of dialling a combination, then rotating the dial back to where the cam gate is. Because the wheelpack, bearing, and fence are not perfectly machined, there will always be one wheel that sticks out more than the others. If the wheel that sticks out has a slot under the fence, the lever will dip and partially engage the cam. Then when you rotate the dial back and forth, the hooked end of the lever will tap the edges of the cam gate making a click on either edge. These are called contact points. Usually you go by feel instead of sound, but sound works as well. Since the cam gate is sloped, as you align more slots under the fence, corresponding to correct combinations, the lever will fall deeper into the cam gate. This causes the pairs (from tapping the left and right edge of the cam gate) of contact points to get closer together. This is a very precise process and so a lot of safe manipulators will attach a precision dial indicator with a magnifying glass so they can read off tenths of numbers. Slop in the mechanism is a big issue as is dirt. A safe manipulator will go through all the dial numbers in one direction and [graph the contact points]( URL_0 ) to find one of the slots. There's a procedure for finding the other slots, then figuring out which order they go in when you dial the final combination. As you can see in the photos, my lock has a cover which slides over the cam gate. You have to turn another knob in the center of the dial to open the cover. If you open the cover, you can't move the dial. There are also serrations on the wheels which screw up the contact points. This makes manipulation much more difficult. Edit: So many edits. Sorry. Turning the dial makes a klicking sound. With an old and/or worn lock, the ""correct"" position might produce a slightly different click.

Why can't current be defined as co-directional with the flow of electrons?,"Electricity is a flow of electrons, and it is a flow of electrons that carries the electricity.

The current is the flow of electrons and the electricity is the flow of electrons. They are the same thing. Current is the flow of electrons, electricity is the flow of electrons. The two terms are interchangeable, and both are correct.","Because current is the flow of charge, not electrons. The particles that allow for the flow of charge are called ""charge carriers"" and electrons happen to have a negative charge, so current flows in the opposite direction of electrons. Electrons aren't the only charge carriers. In semiconductors for example, you have both free electrons and places for electrons to go (called ""holes"") which can act as charge carriers.

Why do car batteries die from not being used?,"Its actually the opposite. The battery is designed to discharge slowly over time, and the slower it discharges the longer the battery lasts. When you use the car regularly it discharges much faster and the battery dies faster. The battery is designed to be a bit like a water tank. If you keep filling it up all the time you'll never run out, but if you just keep adding to it and never drain it you'll end up with a tank that's full of water that you can't use. The battery is designed to be used. The chemicals in the battery react with the electrical current, and the more current that flows through it the more chemicals are used. If you don't use the car regularly, the battery is just sitting there doing nothing. It's not being used, and the chemicals are just sitting there, not being used either. This means that the chemicals are slowly degrading, and the battery is slowly losing its ability to hold its charge. When you do start using the car, it's like a breath of fresh air for the battery, and it starts to recharge. This is why it's important to keep your battery charged up, and to use your car regularly.  ","Everyone is answering the wrong question hehe. A battery that sits is still being consumed. All kinds of batteries lose power as it sits. This is called self discharge. Car batteries are made from a lead grid submerged in a sulfuric acid bath. Once the charge gets below 9v or so, the battery is no longer able to be charged even though the components are still physically there. Another cause of failure is the lead plate is connected to the outside terminals by a small arm. If this arm breaks due to corrosion, it doesn't matter how much charge is left since the path of current is broken. Vehicles have a number of electrical systems that are always on or otherwise requiring power (good example is the clock). These slowly draw power from the battery and reduce the charge in the battery. If left too long, the battery won't have the amps to power the starter motor.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 29.17, 'recall': 39.62, 'fmeasure': 33.6}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.19, 'recall': 5.7, 'fmeasure': 4.83}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.35, 'recall': 19.5, 'fmeasure': 16.53}}"
What is the difference between CDMA and TDMA/FDMA? What are the advantages and disadvantages of CDMA?,"CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) is a method of transmitting data over a wireless network. TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) is a method of transmitting data over a wireless network. FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) is a method of transmitting data over a wireless network. TDMA and FDMA are similar, but they differ in how they divide time and frequency space. CDMA is a method of transmitting data over a wireless network using a different technique than TDMA or FDMA. The advantages of CDMA include: * CDMA allows multiple users to share the same frequency band, which can increase the number of users in a given area. * CDMA can be used in a variety of different applications, including mobile phones, satellite communications, and computer networking. * CDMA is resistant to interference, which can be a problem with TDMA and FDMA. * CDMA is a method of transmitting data over a wireless network using a different technique than TDMA or FDMA. The disadvantages of CDMA include: * CDMA is a relatively new technology, and it is not as well-established as TDMA or FDMA. * CDMA requires a more complex system than TDMA or FDMA, which can increase the cost of using CDMA.  ","TDMA - time domain multiple access. Each unit gets a time slot in which to transmit. So if you’ve got 4 transmitters, you tell unit one to transmit for 15 seconds at the the exact :00 seconds mark, unit two transmits for 15 seconds starting at :15, etc. then if you add another unit, then each one can only transmit for 12.5 seconds on their scheduled interval. Advantage: share the same piece of spectrum. Disadvantages: requires tight time synchronization between all units and can be highly latent with lots of transmitters sharing the space FDMA - you have a big chunk of radio spectrum and then you assign each unit their own smaller piece out of your big chunk. Advantage: simple, no synchronization required. Disadvantage: unless you can dynamically control all of the units and resize their signals, you waste unused spectrum if a unit is off the air CDMA - uses a random code combined with the digital signal to spread the transmitted signal over a wide bandwidth while being able to use a energy efficient signal.

"Why do you not feel like you're going fast while in an airplane, when in fact you're traveling 600+ MPH?","When you are in a car on a highway at 600+ MPH, you are moving very very fast. But you are also moving in a straight line. That means that you are not moving very far. So it feels like you are going very fast, but you are not moving very far. Now imagine you are in a car on a highway and you are going 600+ MPH. But you are also moving in a circle. That means that you are moving very far. You are going in a big circle. And you are going very fast. So you are going very fast and moving very far. This is how it feels when you are on an airplane. You are moving very fast. But you are also moving very far. So it feels like you are going very fast, but you are not moving very far.","There aren't any forces acting on your body that would make you feel that way, except for when you are accelerating to/from that speed. Every part of the airplane -- your seat, the floor, the air in the cabin -- is moving at the same speed as you are, so there is no way for your body to tell. The Earth is hurtling through the air at many times that speed. We feel acceleration and deceleration, a change in speed, and you definitely feel the acceleration for the first 20 minutes of the flight or so as you take off and ascend. That's why you stay in your seat! Your seat is attached to the plane so it's *pushing* you up to the speed. They get to that speed gradually so it's not too uncomfortable. But once you're at cruising speed and altitude, everything in the plane is moving at the same speed as the plane, so it's like your not moving at all. Speed is relative. Also parallax; all the items moving relative to you are either so foreign (clouds) or so far away (ground), it's difficult to judge how fast you're moving relative to them. The human body is not great at sensing speed in general, only acceleration. We have a bunch of senses that all work together to let us know when we're changing speed or direction, but we have to rely on context clues to get a sense of constant speed. The next time you're in a car (as a passenger) close your eyes while the driver is going a constant speed on a straight road. You'll notice that it won't feel different from sitting in a parked car. Your sense of speed in a car is largely dependent on seeing objects in the distance and seeing how you move relative to those objects. When you're in a plane, you don't get that kind of feedback. Even with a window seat, objects are so far away that we don't have a good concept of how fast we're traveling. When you're landing and taking off, you start to gain a sense of speed. Because you don't feel velocity. You could be going a million miles an hour and you wouldn't know it. What you feel is acceleration, a change in velocity. On an ordinary plane flight, this occurs at the beginning (during takeoff) and at the end (during landing). You also feel it when the plane changes direction, which also requires a chance in velocity. You and the air inside the craft all accelerate with the aircraft. As long as the aircraft maintains a relatively steady speed, there are no forces acting on you that would indicate you are travelling fast. Then looking out the window at altitude, objects on the ground are so distant that you don't have a good reference to know how fast you are travelling. The best time to see how fast you are travelling as at takeoff and landing when you have a better reference as to your speed with objects on the ground.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.96, 'recall': 16.76, 'fmeasure': 26.29}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.86, 'recall': 4.34, 'fmeasure': 6.81}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 38.36, 'recall': 10.55, 'fmeasure': 16.54}}"
"if silk is as stretchy as elastic and stronger than steel, why isn't it used more often for... everything?","Silk is not as stretchy as elastic, it's more like a very very thin rubber band. It's also not as strong as steel, but it's still very strong and flexible. It's just not as strong as steel. It's also not as cheap as steel, and it's a lot more difficult to manufacture. So it's mostly used for specialized applications like clothing, parachutes, and medical applications. There are other materials that are stronger than steel and cheaper than silk, like Kevlar and polyethylene, so it's not like silk is the only option.","People have been working on this for probably around 20 years! The problem is, spiders can't be farmed like silkworms. They tried to solve this by taking the gene for making spider silk and putting it in another organism. Now we have yeast and bacteria that make spider silk, and goats whose milk contains spider silk. The problem with this is that it's not in silk form! It's more like a jello, instead of being usable fibers. Spiders typically produces several kinds of silk of varying properties and compositions. The strongest type is the dragline silk they use to dangle from. This typically has an *Ultimate Tensile Strength"" that is about half that of grades of steel used for wire ropes. (Note that the strength of steel can vary significantly based on the composition and the processes used to strengthen it.) The difference is that the density of steel is about 7.8 gram/ cubic cm while silk is about 1.2. So, overall, silk has a much better *Strength-to-Weight ratio* than steel. However, currently the material with the best strength to weight ratio is carbon fiber. CF is common for applications that require extreme strength, vibration resistance, and minimum weight such as aircraft, drones, car body parts, The reason that synthetic silk hasn't been a commercial success, is complex. Apparently, the properties of spider dragline silk involves some sophisticated chemical processing tricks, performed by cells in the spider's silk gland. This yields a fairly complex, well ordered molecular structure. Moreover, the individual silk fibers themselves have a sophisticated multilayer structure. The processes spiders use to produce silk aren't well understood. Laboratory made silk tends to have disappointing properties, and a molecular structure that is rather disordered compared to spider silk. Silk is biodegradable. In fact some spiders eat their old webs. But this is a problem in many applications where you'd want to use something like silk. For example, you don't want your clothes to start decomposing in the wash. You don't want to go climbing and discover that your ropes are moldy and smell terrible. Now, considering that there are synthetic fibers already on the market that have equal or superior properties such as aramid or high modulus polyethylene, and require much more straightforward and simple processing methods, silk is a bit of a non-starter. Unless it can be made more cheaply and the demand for biodegradable fibers grows.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.46, 'recall': 11.14, 'fmeasure': 17.97}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.27, 'recall': 3.16, 'fmeasure': 5.1}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.28, 'recall': 6.78, 'fmeasure': 10.94}}"
what actually happens when you set a microwave oven to different power levels?,"Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation. The frequency of microwaves is so high that they can penetrate many materials, including water. When you microwave food, the microwaves penetrate the food and cause the water molecules in the food to rotate. As the water molecules rotate, they collide with each other and with the sides of the container. This causes the water molecules to heat up. The energy from the microwaves is transferred to the water molecules, causing them to heat up. The amount of energy transferred depends on the power level of the microwaves.","Microwave ovens only have one power setting. On...and off. So why do they give you a number of different power settings and cooking modes on it's control panel? Well what actually happens is these modes do not actually alter how much power the microwave emits. Instead it changes how frequently it applies this power over a set amount of time. A microwave works by using radio waves to agitate water molecules in food. Changing the amount of power these radio waves are emitted at would do nothing to cook the food faster or slower as the molecules would get agitated in the exact same way. So instead of altering the power the radio waves are emitted at, we alter the amount of time the food is exposed to this ""radiation"" in an on and off cycle. Cooking a food item on lower power mode for 30 seconds could make the microwave apply the radiation to excite the water molecules in the food for 1 second followed by gaps of 3 seconds where no radiation is applied. So the food was actually exposed to cooking for 8 seconds. Cooking the same item on high power mode might expose the food to cooking for the entire 30 seconds. As you can see, cooking the food on low power mode for 30 seconds is the exact same thing as cooking the food on high power mode for just 8 seconds. So why do we not just do this? Because it's about uniform cooking. Or making sure all parts of the food is cooked. Unfortunately microwaves do not emit the radio waves in a uniform pattern. So to insure we do not get uncooked spots of food, the microwave moves the food around using it's rotating plate to make sure the radio waves travel through all parts of the food. By alternating the power, the microwave ensures all parts of the food gets heated without outright overcooking the food. It still gets it wrong sometimes, as you might have experienced when you sometimes eat some microwaved food and find an overcooked or undercooked spot (This is common with microwavable pizza). TL;DR: Microwaves only have one power setting. The power modes on its controls merely change how frequently it alternates the on/off cycle of applying the cooking process to the food in order to ensure it is uniformly heated without ruining it. To add to the excellent answers here: listen to your microwave next time you use it on 50% power. You'll hear fans running all the time, but there will be a deep humming noise that turns on and off periodically: that's the microwave generator.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.95, 'recall': 12.47, 'fmeasure': 20.59}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.15, 'recall': 4.02, 'fmeasure': 6.64}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 37.89, 'recall': 8.02, 'fmeasure': 13.24}}"
Why are motorcycles so loud compared to cars?," tl;dr: Cars are built for efficiency, motorcycles for performance. Performance and efficiency are inversely related. The reason cars are quieter than motorcycles is because of the way they are designed. Cars are built to be as efficient as possible. This means that they are built to be as aerodynamic as possible. They are streamlined, and the shape of the car is designed to cut through the air with the least amount of resistance. This is what makes cars so efficient. Motorcycles, on the other hand, are not built for efficiency. They are built for performance. Motorcycles are designed to be fast, and the way they are built allows them to be fast. Motorcycles are built to be as lightweight as possible. This means that they have a lot less material in them. The material that is in them is lightweight, but strong. This is what makes motorcycles so fast. But, because motorcycles are so lightweight, they are also very loud. When a motorcycle is moving, it is making a lot of noise. This is because the material that is in the motorcycle is lightweight, but strong. This means that it is vibrating very quickly. This vibration is what makes the noise. So, motorcycles are louder than cars because they are built to be fast. They are not built to be efficient.  ","1, Not all of them are. 2, Some motorcyclists prefer a loud sound because 2a, they think it's cool 2b, the vibration feels powerful 2c, they believe that ""loud pipes save lives"" (that is, that when other motorists *hear* a loud motorcycle, they're not likely to accidentally hit it) 3, different muffling systems. motorcycles are loud for 2 reasons. One; the engine is right there. it isn't shielded or dampened by layers of metal, so you hear any noises it's making. Secondly, the exhaust pipes. They're usually stock made for a certain sound, but can be modded to be either louder or quieter. I am of the belief that having a bit of rumble is necessary for a good biking experience; and can certainly make you more noticeable in some situations. Though i always reccommend getting a loud aftermarket horn. the meep meep horns dont do jack. There's nothing inherently loud about motorcycle engines, I have a 1200cc engine motorcycle with a stock muffler and it's not loud. People put inefficient noise reduction mufflers on motorcycles or cars for two reasons, because they think it reduces the flow of air through the mufflers thereby increasing engine performance, and because they think it sounds good. They don't *have* to be, some motorcycles are really quiet. An example of a very quiet motorcycle is the Honda Goldwing, some police forces used Honda Goldwings as [police bikes]( URL_0 ) and they stopped because pedestrians kept stepping right in front of them because they don't see or hear them coming. Apart from necessarily smaller/shorter exhaust systems and air boxes a lot of the reason is the higher revs bike engines run at. I use a bike engine in a car so it has a decent length exhaust run and a big silencer on it but it's still very loud because the usable rev range is so high. I've actually been trying to get it quieter to meet race track noise limits and it's practically impossible to get it as quiet as a normal car. Induction noise is as big a problem as exhaust noise too by the way...they're sucking in a lot of air at 13,000 rpm.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 49.55, 'recall': 29.02, 'fmeasure': 36.61}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.05, 'recall': 5.29, 'fmeasure': 6.68}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.27, 'recall': 11.87, 'fmeasure': 14.98}}"

Do you have to heat LNG to decompressing it so it can be transported to individual homes?," LNG is natural gas that has been cooled to a very low temperature. It is compressed into a liquid and shipped in specially designed tanks. When you want to use the LNG, it is warmed up in a special tank on your property and then fed into your gas line. LNG is natural gas that has been liquefied. This means it has been cooled to a very low temperature, so that it takes up a lot less space. It is then compressed into a liquid, which makes it easier to transport. LNG is typically transported on special ships, which are designed to keep the gas at the very low temperature. When the ship arrives at its destination, the LNG is transferred to a special tank, which is designed to keep the gas at the low temperature. The tank is then connected to your home's gas line, and the gas is warmed up to a temperature that is safe for use.","No, you can expand it, which makes it very cold, and pump it into pipes in the ground. The ground will slowly warm it to a useful temperature. You do have to add heat to it, but when something is at -160°C, getting heat into it isn't the problem. In addition, the amount of heat energy required, the ""latent heat of vaporization"" isn't that high (510 kJ/kg), especially not compared with water (2257 kJ/kg).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 18.01, 'recall': 36.71, 'fmeasure': 24.17}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.88, 'recall': 3.85, 'fmeasure': 2.52}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 11.18, 'recall': 22.78, 'fmeasure': 15.0}}"
Why would a person downshift and use a lower gear to accelerate (or obtain more power)?,"Because it's a different ratio of engine speed to road speed. The engine is turning more times for each mile of road speed. The higher the gear, the less times the engine turns for each mile of road speed. When you downshift, you are basically changing the ratio of engine speed to road speed. So, if you are driving at 60mph, you can downshift to 55mph and get the same power, but the engine is turning slower.","It's all about at what RPM (revolutions per minute) your engine produces the most power. Let's assume that when you're driving along in 4th at 80 kph your engine is turning over at 2,000 RPM and is producing 80 HP. However, maximum power is produced at 5,000 RPM when your engine produces 200 HP. Now, you need to pass and accelerate quickly from 80 kph to 130 kph. If you simply, 'put your foot to the floor,' you have only 80 HP to call on immediately that will somewhat slowly rise as your RPM slowly increases. However, if you gear down to 3rd or even 2nd as necessary so that your RPM immediately rises to 5,000 RPM and peak HP, you'll have immediate access to 200 HP and your acceleration will be much quicker. Downshifting on a manual is exactly what an automatic transmission is doing when it shifts into 'passing gear' when you 'floor it.' It's just downshifting. Lower gears produce more rotational force (torque) because a bigger gear is spinning the output. It's all about leverage. Here's a great video that explains it: URL_0 This is for motorcycles, but will work for most vehicles: Depending on the make and model of the car, there is something called a ""power band"" in the rpm. RPM is revolutions per minute, which refers to the revolutions of the engine. At the upper part of the rpm's there's a power band, several degrees of rpm that provide the more torque per revolution. When you downshift into a lower gear (with the intent to accelerate) you throw the RPM (the engine) into that power band, resulting in faster acceleration. There's an old saying: ""drop a gear and disappear"". When you drop that gear and accelerate, you'll blast past anyone at speed.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.69, 'recall': 14.38, 'fmeasure': 23.02}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.69, 'recall': 2.88, 'fmeasure': 4.63}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.05, 'recall': 7.99, 'fmeasure': 12.79}}"
Why does concrete from 40/50 years ago seem better than the concrete of today?,It's a bit like comparing a 1960's car to a 2010 car. The 1960's car is probably going to be a lot more reliable and last a lot longer than the 2010 car. The 1960's car will also be a lot more durable and not fall apart as quickly.

Having more and bigger rocks (to an extent) might result in a stronger concrete, but it also makes it more difficult to mix and pour the concrete, and it won't be as consistent. So, it is possible that the older concrete is stronger but the size of the rocks in it makes it too difficult to pour from a modern cement truck. It is also very possible that you are experiencing survivor bias, meaning that the only old sidewalks you see were the very best, all the rest were torn up and replaced with newer concrete more recently. Concrete will never fully cure; it continually hardens forever, although for all practical purposes, it reaches a point where further hardening will be so slow as to be unnoticeable. So, maybe the old concrete you've seen was left alone long enough, and newer stuff was not. That ""rough rocky look"" is actually just the aggregate having come to the surface because the old cement and sand part has washed or worn away. The smooth pasty look would have been closer to what the ""old"" concrete looked like when it was freshly poured. It isn't stronger - not by any means - just go check out some very old barns and see how thier very old foundations are doing. If anything today's concrete is significantly stronger due to exact measurements, extra chemicals (depending on specific use) and superior finishing techniques. You've gotten some good answers here so far, but add to it that you've likely only seen concrete from 40-50 years ago that is good. The rest has deteriorated. As with anything that needs to be mixed, it's not just the quality of the mix but the accuracy that can make a difference in longevity. Add to that differences in use and soil stability under the concrete and you'll see some big differences no matter when it was made. As a commercial real estate appraiser I've seen tons of 80-90 year old buildings with solid concrete, and I've seen 40-50 year old buildings with concrete that has crumbled nearly to dust. You're just more likely to see the concrete that has lasted well, the weaker stuff is already gone. Every single concrete mix is a little different and some are a lot different, depending on the specifics of the material. Various concretes have different PSI (pounds per square inch) strengths; you can buy at Home Depot concrete mixes at 4,000, 5,000, and 6,000 psi - and the lower psi mix is cheaper. Commercial concrete can easily be at 10,000 psi or more. So if someone did some cheap sidewalk work with a lower final psi, and the columns or floors in your building are a high psi, that could be the difference. The builder can change the mix of cement and rock to get different strengths, and also to change how fast it will reach those strengths. Also, concrete gets harder as it ages. Usually it gets pretty tough by 28 days - maybe 90% of its maximum hardness. And then takes much longer to get from 90% to 95% maximum hardness -but it does keep getting harder. Also, you also only see old concrete that is good and has lasted. The cheap concrete from 1965 has mostly been replaced by 2017. That's a selection bias - if you only look at 200 year old houses, you conclude ""all 200 year old houses are pretty well built."" But that's because only the exceptionally well built houses or the ones with worthwhile features lasted 200 years. All the crappy ones were torn down a long time ago, or so extensively remodeled over the years that no original portions are left.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 53.69, 'recall': 12.44, 'fmeasure': 20.2}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.41, 'recall': 1.25, 'fmeasure': 2.03}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.53, 'recall': 6.84, 'fmeasure': 11.11}}"
How does a rigid airship go up and down withput releasing helium?,"The rigid airship is not held up by helium. The airship is held up by the shape of the frame. The airship is made of a material called ""dacron"" which is a lightweight material that is made of a combination of polyester and polyamide. The frame is made of metal. The frame is held together by metal bolts. The airship is then filled with a gas, usually helium, to make it light enough to fly. The gas is trapped in the frame by the shape of the frame. The frame is very rigid so the airship can't change shape in flight. The gas is very light so the airship can fly. The airship can also be filled with other gases, like hydrogen or methane.

By pumping air into or out of the ballonets, you can change the volume of the lifting gas without affecting the shape of the outside of the airship: this changes the buoyancy. URL_1 The other answers seem like they are talking to an engineering student. Okay, so when you fill a helium balloon, youre filling it with metal tanks that just sit on the ground. Those metal tanks have pressurized helium in them, which make them heavy enough not to lift off the ground (not that they would, but for the sake of argument). So if you put a bunch of these tanks inside a rigid airship, you can fill up rubber balloons inside the shell of the airship to create the lift. Not only are you decompressing the air in the tanks, making the tanks lighter, but now youre replacing the breathable air in the chamber with lifting balloons. The rigid airship is just a protective shell for the balloons, and a surface to store the tanks. TLDR: The important fact of helium based vehicles is being able to compress the helium to make it heavy, so you can descend without wasting helium. Inflatable balloons are within the airship and can be filled, which increases their volume and forces breatheable air out of the ship. This is why you see catwalks within airships, which can be used by people without air-masks.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.98, 'recall': 38.55, 'fmeasure': 42.35}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.35, 'recall': 7.66, 'fmeasure': 8.42}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.19, 'recall': 19.85, 'fmeasure': 21.8}}"
What exactly makes CANDU reactors more safe than other nuclear reactors?,"I’m not an expert, but I can give a layman’s explanation. CANDU reactors are the only type of nuclear reactor that can be used to produce plutonium. Plutonium is a key component in nuclear weapons. If a nuclear reactor is producing plutonium, then it is a potential threat to national security. CANDU reactors are designed to be safe, because they are designed to be used to produce plutonium. It’s a very important feature. The only other type of nuclear reactor that can produce plutonium is a pressurized water reactor. This is the type of reactor that is used at Fukushima. These reactors are less safe, because they are not designed to produce plutonium. They are designed to produce electricity.","Candu reactors aren't necessarily safer. They are different. In terms of probabilistic risk assessment, the core damage frequency for candu plants better than PWR plants and on par with generation 3 BWR plants. In terms of the reactor itself, it can still melt in a loss of decay heat removal event like Fukushima. It also has a runaway condition during loss of coolant accidents that can damage fuel, but still maintain coolable core configurations and keep release rates within accident limits.

How are flood plain maps drawn up? Is there anything that goes into them other than scientific data?,"It depends on the area, but generally flood plains are created by a government agency, such as the US Army Corp of Engineers, and the US Geological Survey. They use a combination of modeling, field data, and historical data to determine the likelihood of a flood occurring, and how much water it would take to cause a flood. They then use this data to determine the flood plain, and to determine how high the water will be in the flood plain. They also use this data to determine how far inland the flood will go, and how long it will last. The maps are updated periodically, and the data is also used to help with flood control, and to help with flood mitigation.","A lot of that is elevation, and they are counting inches. Homes are usually built a couple inches above the road (maybe a foot?), this gives you a lawn that slopes away from the home, and the road itself slopes to the ditch/drains on the side. It reduces flooding in the road and home (prevents heavy rain from creating streams into your home). Those flood maps are determining if your lawn is going to flood. If you had heavy rains making a flood, it would be normal to see the ditch in the road fill up first, and then slowly spread over the road, and then it would come up your lawn closer and closer to your door. Those lines are how likely it is to get that far.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 35.77, 'recall': 33.85, 'fmeasure': 34.78}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.92, 'recall': 4.65, 'fmeasure': 4.78}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.7, 'recall': 17.69, 'fmeasure': 18.18}}"
How does a database handle 1 billion users?,"A database is essentially a bunch of files. It's a big file, a big bunch of files, or a bunch of big files. It's not like one big file, it's more like a bunch of files that all share a common format. The database will store the data in those files. The files will be stored on hard drives, or on SSDs, or on some other type of storage device. The amount of storage that a database will use depends on the size of the database. The more data you have, the more storage it will use. It's not like a database can use more storage, it's just that it can store more data. A database is designed to be able to store a lot of data, but it can't store an infinite amount of data. If you want to store more data, you will need to add more storage devices. It's kind of like your house. You can't just keep adding rooms to your house, you can only add so many rooms. If you want to have a bigger house, you'll need to add a bigger house. You can add a bigger house by adding a bigger house, but you can't just add a bigger house to your house.","The good news is that data isn't stored in one giant table. It is actually made up of multiple tables. Tools exist that then link those tables and read the information in them fairly effeciently. Oracle, MySQL, etc handle massive amounts of data pretty easily. Because these tools don't actually care what the data is, they just need the reference points, they can quickly retrieve the data. Think of how RAM works: fast switching pointers. This is how you get a user's data out of billions in a table. The software doesn't need to know that the person's first name is JOHN, it just needs to know that that user's pointer is here and it points to that table and then that table points to the next connected bit of data, etc. It is a chain of tables. Again, most of the retreival of the data isn't getting ALL of the data, it is just getting the pointer. That pointer leads to the next pointer, and so forth. Just fast swapping pointers and then one DISPLAY of the data. Big Data as it is termed, is a huge industry specifically for this challenge. It isn't perfect, but an entire industry exists simply to find better ways to store data so that that pointer chain can be processed faster and faster. The simplest answer to your question is that the billions of users (and trillions of other pieces of data associated with those users) are stored on a database split across thousands of machines. Every piece of information has an ID associated with it, and each ID maps to a particular portion of the database hosted by a particular set of machines responsible for that portion of the database. Software abstractions allow you to fetch the data associated with various IDs efficiently without worrying about the details of how the data are stored across the machines. If you want more details on Facebook in particular, a good starting point is to look into things they've written about TAO, a system they built on top of MySQL and memcache to manage their distributed data store. Background: I work with data for a living. You mentioned the word ""big"", and that's really appropriate here because some data can't be stored on a single logical volume (disk drive). Think of a standard database like a file system on your hard drive. Each element of the database has an index, and you can query the disk via index to retrieve records, kind of like accessing a file on your computer. The database engine keeps a record of where each bit of data is stored, so it can fetch them on request. What happens when you have so many records that indexing them becomes impossible? For example, you might have far more data than can fit on a single drive. Or you might have so many dimensions to your data that indexing it properly becomes too computationally expensive. This is where we transition into ""big data"". Big Data refers to database storage systems that help manage very large or very dimensional data structures. This happens by storing the data itself across multiple drives / volumes, and creating aggregated indexes or ""nodes"" to slice the data for retrieval. The actual mechanics of this can be pretty complicated, but there are drop-in solutions like Hadoop to streamline the process. Depending on how quickly you want the data retrieved, how deep the data is, how many simultaneous calls you expect, and a host of other factors, you'll set the number of nodes accordingly to balance cost (each new aggregation requires disk space and horsepower) and function (more nodes = faster retrieval). You might be surprised by what data actually qualifies as ""big"" data. With proper indexing and partitioning, a SQL DB can handle millions upon millions of records without flinching. On the other hand, a poorly optimized DB can result in slow read times and clunky operation with just a few million transactions. Data is neat! Big Data Engineer here. The ELI5 answer is that your data is replicated to multiple machines in easier to handle chunks. Say you have a table with 100 rows. What Facebook does is splits these tables into 5 machines each holding 60 rows. ""But wait, that's 300 rows. Why did my data increase?"" Well because if we had a unit of data in just one place, then you create a bottleneck. If everyone was viewing Elon Musk's FB page, then the one machine with Elon's page wouldn't be able to handle traffic for the other 19 people. By duplicating the data, Elon's FB page can be stored on three different machines. Finally, you have one more machine that routes incoming requests for data. ""Looking for Elon Musk's page? Go to machine A. TheNak1123's page? Go to Machine B. Elon again? Go to Machine C."" The key point to remember is that storage is cheap. A 1 TB hard disk costs a consumer like you or me 50 bucks. The key resource for these companies is time. By throwing money to buy more computers and splitting up the data, Facebook can efficiently organize and use large quantities of data on the scale of Exabytes (Millions of Terabytes). My area of interest also. They have new types of databases that do not store data in row format(NoSQL) this removes the performance constraints on storing such data in a relational database. They also do not use one database but what you get is api's pulling data from many sources e.g there could be a Ugandan facebook user db only. Facebook is the creator of new frameworks such as presto which enable speedy access to data. Recognize that 1 billion users is really just a Google and Facebook problem and maybe a handful of others. The basic pieces of relational databases, if used properly, ensure that most of the time you don't actually need to store whole records. You store the bits that are unique and then just keep links to the bits. Then you make sure that you never ask questions that require you to scan the entire database. Think about a library. You don't have to look at every single book to find something specific. You look up the book in the catalogue, get the books call number and then go right to the specific shelf you need. Databases work this way too. The library catalogue is a database index. For those rare cases when you do want to browse in a library, you don't pick random shelves, you arrange the shelves in sections that have books of the same type. So you can browse, but not the whole library. For databases this is partitioning or sharding. Lastly, modern databases can do some special things with indexes when you're not looking for individual records but you want to count things. Most analytics queries aren't actually for individual records but for aggregates. You can define views and indices on particular types of aggregates so that asking those kinds of questions is more like going to one specific shelf in a library instead of scanning all the books one by one. You need good database design, good database admin, and in very rare circumstances brand new tech. Layers upon layers of caching, prefetching and denormalized views. Also data centres near the physical location of the user combined with really clever precompiled queries. Basically magic at that point. It's vastly interesting but also incredibly complicated. There are a whole lot of techniques, but to keep it ELI5 -- it's *conceptually* one big database, but under the covers it's broken up into a bunch of pieces. Let's say it's 1000 pieces for a given table; those 1000 pieces are actually on 1000 different servers. Some kinds of systems query this by having a map of which categories are stored on which servers. For example, your username begins with ""abc"", users with ""abc"" are on server database-a. Then you can query database-a for the actual result. This only works with some kinds of data. Some kinds of systems instead send the query to _all 1000 servers_. Since each server only has a small set of data to look through, they can answer relatively quickly, and then the querying software can further comb through the returned results, which leads to getting useful results very quickly. A very common way to do this is [MapReduce]( URL_0 ). Hey! I can answer this question. So large data sets, like you see at Facebook or Netflix, are typically stored in a *horizontally scaling* database like Cassandra. Horizontal scaling means that to increase the performance of the database you just add more computers (which I'll call machines from here on out). How does this work? Well, Cassandra is a distributed database system. This means the entire data set is contained on a bunch of different machines, not just one. This is called a cluster. All the machines in the cluster talk to each other to make sure they're all in sync. And when somebody requests data, they can do so from any one of the machines in the cluster. Every time data is saved to the database, we specify what's called a *primary key*. This tells Cassandra exactly which one of the many machines to save the data to. This makes searching faster because we not only break up the large sets of data, but we know exactly where that data sits in the cluster. Think of a primary key as your zip code. We also specify a *clustering key*, which is used to tell Cassandra how to sort all the data on an individual machine. Think of the clustering key as your home address. With the primary key and the clustering key, Cassandra can very quickly find the data you're looking for. To make searching faster, all you have to do is add another machine to the cluster. This decreases the amount of work each machine has to do individually. This is the key concept behind horizontal scaling. Apple, for instance, has about 1000 machines in their cluster. Hope I didn't butcher my explanation. Source: am a software developer who has worked with big data Nobody is mentioning the most basic concept that makes all of this possible while seeming impossible: humans think linearly, but computers access data logarithmicly. When data is properly indexed, finding 1 thing in a billion is more like finding 1 thing in 30 (logarithm base 2 of 1 billion). The truth is: it doesn’t. At scales like you’re talking data is replicated amongst many independent databases which might not even be traditional RDBMS, they could even be memory based no-sql type databases. systems like these also have multiple layers of caching. It is a complex problem requiring teams of developers to solve. Ultimately the system gives a user the illusion that the entire world is connected to a single shared database but that’s not the truth. Checkout this for an overview of high scalability systems with some details: URL_1 Basically what all other said: partitioning (ala divide algorithms). Ensuring that data is consistent between partitions, geographical replicas - is a whole other beast: do you prefer to do it quickly but risk having some inconsistencies (weak/eventual consistency) OR do you prefer slowing down but ensuring everything is consistent between clusters. Caching is another strategy. The fact that you went to your 2010 records probably made some literal hard drives spinning somewhere. But if you are browsing your wall, that was served from fast RAM in a memcache or similar process. In some fancy pants edge rare cases data may go into painstakingly slow tape drives with robotic arms and that could take seconds, even minutes. Check out Amazon Glacier for example and YouTube videos of robotic arms taking tape drives. To see a real architecture all the way down to the hw level, check out StackOverflows posts on their architecture: URL_0 Sources: studying for SRE interview for the past couple of months :) The same way that a filing cabinet would hold thousands upon thousands of files for, say, medical patients: Have separate folders for last name letters, so that instead of searching through every single folder, you just take the patient's last name's first letter and look through that folder first.

Massive quantities of data can be processed and used as long as the architecture is made correctly. Edit: the media storage section should be above the content delivery provider Lot of good answers here. Lots of detail and specifics, but none Is consider ELI5 - so I'm going to take a shot. There are lots of kinds of databases, so the exact solution varies a lot whether you use what's commonly referred to as a relational database (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server), to document databases (MongoDB, CouchDB), graph databases (Neo4J, Atlas), to triple stores (Redland, AllegroGraph, DB2, Jena). But regardless of the kind of database, and the amount of data stored - the trick to storing vast amounts of data is having an efficient way to organize the data in a way you plan to access it. Say you have huge quantities of LEGOS. They come in lots of shapes, sizes, and colors. In order to effectively build something quickly - you need to organize the blocks in a way that makes it easy for you to find. Say you want to build a pile of parts in single color? Well you might just create bins of legos only organized by color since you only care about the color of the part. But then let's say you want to build a tower that uses only 2x6 bricks. You then might organize by shape instead. However what if you needed to build an entire structure that used a specific ""recipe"" calling for specific size, color, shape and quantity of bricks? You might then have a bin for each style of brick, sorting bricks that are of the same shape, color, and size in the same pile. Then organize the piles in a way that you could quickly locate any specific part in quantity very fast. This might be keeping all the same colored bricks close together and organizing those piles from small to large shapes. Big Data is handled no differently. One creates an index into the data in a manner that is equivalent to the way you will search. So regardless of the type of DB system used, if you are searching using color, size, and shape, you create an index of only those things color, size, and quantity with a reference to where the entire piece of data resides. High traffic sites are not a simple client-server-database architecture, you have many more components that help deal with the massive amounts of requests that are sent their way. The most useful tools for scaling are ( listed alphabetically ). 1. Caching - avoid hitting the computes as much as possible let the cache handle it 2. CDN (content delivery network) - let the CDN take as much load from their origin and let the edge nodes take take care of it 3. Layering - Put in as many layers as necessary to have resiliency for example, have a layer of servers that detect where the request is coming from ; if request comes from mobile send it to a different service stack than if it comes from desktop or if it as API request etc. Also consider caching at each layer of the stack 4. Load balancing - use as many load balancers as necessary. It is always a good idea to put your servers and databases behind a load balancer When it comes specifically to the database layer, data in database is typically put in different databases based on logical usage. For example, there could it be database hosted on a bunch of linux hosts that stores only user authentication information. There would be another database hosted on many hosts that stores all the posts user has created. This is done for multiple reasons, one of which is that there are limits to the number of connections a database can open before it runs out of connections another reason can be that the type of database used for one usecase might not be the best solution for another type. For example, RDBMS is not a great for transactional data but not so great at analytical data like analyzing social networks etc, you would want to use a graph database for that. And ofcourse, within each logical separation, you can will have the data in the database optimized using partitioning, normalization and indexing etc. Other redditors here have explained this in enough detail, so I am not going to repeat. You can also have multiple logical instance (where each logical instance is a pool (a pool is a collection of single machines or hosts) of database servers on a Solaris/AIX/Linux/Windows etc server), where you might have 10 instances that are read-only and only 1 instance where new data gets written and synced read only instances of the database - how often does a user update their facebook password or username vs how often do they login ? Using the above mentioned tools, architects come up with systems that serve massive traffic. How you use these depends on what your usecase is, analyzing your user behavior on your website and your server/data center capacity etc, which a lot of times boils down to how much will you be reading and how much will you be writing at it logical layer. And if your abstract all these ideas high enough, the main idea here is to to *divide and conquer*. The key is to figure out *what you need conquering* and *how you want to divide* in order to conquer... So I guess that's the ELI5 answer ? ***divide and conquer***. Would a 5 year old understand division ? **I it would be really interested to hear a Reddit engineer's take on how Reddit does their scaling... A reddit engineer AMA ?** Databases can really just epicly be big and Oracle and what not can handle that stuff. Every once in a while I get a call in the middle of the night to add another 1TB to a 227TB database... The real answer is indexing, how you organize your data, and technologies like Oracle text, hadoop, and other stuff like that. 8 Billion rows in a table is not out of this world. The best way is to break the data down into pieces (tables) to the point that it's almost annoying. Everything get's an ID and that ID is indexed in it's respective table. Retrieving a ID which is a unique number, is very easy and almost instantaneous. Consider the following case: You are a company that receives computer files and extracts all of the details about each file into a searchable database so that you can easily determine which files are import and which ones are not. If you think about a file, there are lots of important properties you can keep track of and the data is called Metadata. You have: File Size, File Extension, Date Modified, Date Created, Mime-Type, Original File Path, File Name, Directory Name, etc... then you start getting into file type specific attributes... for Microsoft Office files you have Author, Document Title, A flag for Encrypted or not, Office has it's own Date Created and Modified values, version of the document format... I could go on and on and on... when you add emails you can literally have hundreds and hundreds of potential metadata fields. When you have a database of several hundred million files, that can add up to several billion rows of metadata very quickly. So how do you get all the metadata for a file? Let's Look: First you start off with a really simple table: DocumentID| Bates -----|---------- 23459872345 | Some formatted number a person can easily keep track of 23459872346 | PEIGHT-3548-3405 Then you have a table with all of the metadata fields to ID's MID | Description ---|--- 1 | FileName 2 | File EXT 3 | DateMod 4 | DateCreated Now.... how do you organize the actual metadata? Let's look at a table with the metadata for 4 files ID | DocumentID | MID | Value --|----------|---|----- 1 | 23459872345 | 1 | Awwwyeah.gif 2 | 23459872345 | 2 | gif 3 | 23459872345 | 3 | 5/27/2017 02:33 4 | 23459872345 | 4 | 5/27/2017 02:33 5 | 23459872346 | 1 | 06 - the world is mine - david guetta.mp3 6 | 23459872346 | 2 | mp3 7 | 23459872346 | 3 | 12/28/2016 03:12 8 | 23459872346 | 4 | 5/27/2017 03:12 9 | 23459872347 | 1 | IP schema.xlsx 10 | 23459872347 | 2 | xlsx 11 | 23459872347 | 3 | 9/18/2017 01:00 12 | 23459872347 | 4 | 1/1/2017 18:36 13 | 23459872348 | 1 | patch panel plan.xlsx 14 | 23459872348 | 2 | xlsx 15 | 23459872348 | 3 | 10/9/2016 03:41 16 | 23459872348 | 4 | 10/8/2016 23:55 So how do you get all the metadata from a specific file? In the large table the ID column and the document ID column are indexed. So you would search that table by document ID and 4 rows would be returned. If you just wanted the file extension you would throw an AND in there and you would want MID = 2. This is a very simplistic search and explination, but that's how it would work. The real question is.... how do you backup a 227TB database? You don't... you keep it in triplicate using different technologies....","{'rouge1': {'precision': 88.18, 'recall': 5.22, 'fmeasure': 9.86}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 38.36, 'recall': 2.26, 'fmeasure': 4.27}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 48.18, 'recall': 2.85, 'fmeasure': 5.39}}"
Why are GPUs faster than CPUs?,"Because they're designed to do the same thing, over and over again, without getting tired. CPUs are designed to handle a wide variety of tasks, but they're not very good at any one task. They're designed to be flexible, and they're good at doing a lot of things, but they're not very good at doing one thing. GPUs, on the other hand, are designed to do one thing, and they're very good at it. They're designed to handle a lot of data, and they're very good at handling a lot of data. They're designed to do things very quickly, and they're very good at doing things very quickly. That's why GPUs are faster than CPUs. They're designed to do one thing very well, and they do that one thing very quickly.","Imagine you're a house painting company. CPU is your top employee. She can handle masking, mixing, interior, exterior, edging, wall texturing, pretty much anything you want. She's super fast, but she can't be in two places at once so for a large project it's still going to take her a while to finish it. GPU is your team of 20 unskilled laborers. They have no idea how to paint, but they're very good at following directions if you set them up and tell them exactly what to do. They always work as a team, they have to be doing the exact same thing at all times. CPU and GPU work really well together and they can finish a house in half the time. While it's true that GPU is 20x faster than CPU at really simple tasks like painting one very large blank wall a solid color, most of the time you need a combination of CPU and GPU to get the job done. For example, CPU will come into a room and mix the paint, mask the edges, and prepare the brushes. Then she gives each GPU laborer a section of the wall and tells them what to do. While they're busy painting she goes to set up the next room. When she gets back, they're finished and she can do the remaining touch-up work. When you're playing a game on your computer, your CPU is in charge. It does all of the AI and coordinates sound, graphics, input, networking, and everything else. When it's time to render each frame, it figures out exactly what to draw, then hands it off to the GPU with very specific instructions on what to do. The GPU executes those really quickly, freeing up the CPU to spend more time on other things that the GPU isn't capable of. GPUs are not faster then CPUs in a general sense. GPUs are 'fast' because they are highly parallel when doing identical operations - this is called SIMD or Single Instruction, Multiple Data. For example if you asked the question ""What is 1+1?"" a CPU can answer it faster. If you asked the question ""What is 1+1 and 2+2 and 3+3 and 4+4"" then the GPU could answer it faster, assuming all those numbers where nicely lined up in advance. But if you asked the question ""What is 1+1 and 2-2 and 3*4 and 4/4"" then the CPU would again be faster. If we think of them as people then a 4 core CPU is 4 really smart people in an office. A GPU might be 4 big rooms each containing 100 monkeys and a trainer who shouts out commands.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.24, 'recall': 16.99, 'fmeasure': 25.99}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.97, 'recall': 3.66, 'fmeasure': 5.61}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.97, 'recall': 8.6, 'fmeasure': 13.16}}"
What makes a rocket go?," Different things can make a rocket go. We have a number of different types of rockets, including liquid-fueled rockets, solid-fueled rockets, and hybrid rockets. In general, a rocket works by using a fuel that is burned in the presence of oxygen. The heat produced by the combustion of the fuel and oxygen is absorbed by a heat exchanger, and then used to heat a propellant, which is typically liquid hydrogen or liquid oxygen. The propellant is pumped into a combustion chamber, where it is mixed with air, and then ignited. The resulting explosion propels the rocket forward. The heat exchanger is also used to cool the rocket’s nozzle, so that the propellant can be burned at a high enough temperature to produce enough thrust to lift the rocket off the ground. We have a number of different types of nozzles, including bell-shaped nozzles, conical nozzles, and bell-conical nozzles. In general, the nozzle is designed to maximize the exhaust velocity of the propellant, so that the rocket can achieve the highest possible thrust. The exhaust velocity is determined by the mass flow rate of the propellant, and the pressure of the combustion gases.  ","You may have heard Newton's third law, ""for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."" In this case, the rocket is shooting out a whole bunch of particles one way with a lot of force, thus providing thrust and moving the rocket the opposite way. It is the rapid expansion of hot gases, and it works the same way that the recoil from a gun works when you fire a bullet. Think of it as a controlled firing of many bullets, causing a persistent force in the opposite direction, which moves the rocket. A rocket is powered by a very energetic chemical reaction causing a whole lot of gases to forced out of a nozzle on the bottom of the rocket. Newton's 3rd Law states that for every action there is an equal an opposite reaction. So a whole lot of mass being pushed out the bottom of the rocket at high speed produces an equal and opposite force that pushes the rocket forward. A controlled explosion isn't a bad way to think about how rockets work.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 35.53, 'recall': 38.46, 'fmeasure': 36.94}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.12, 'recall': 6.63, 'fmeasure': 6.37}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.26, 'recall': 18.68, 'fmeasure': 17.94}}"
How does digital clock work?,"The clock is a computer. It's just a computer that happens to have a clock built in. The clock is a computer because it does calculations. It does a calculation for each second, and then it uses that calculation to decide what the next second will be. The computer can do this because it has a clock, which is a device that measures time. The clock measures time by counting the number of pulses that it receives from a crystal oscillator. A crystal oscillator is a device that produces a regular, steady stream of electrical pulses. The clock uses this stream of pulses to measure time. The clock can do this because it has a way to divide the number of pulses it receives into a smaller number of pulses that it uses to measure time. The computer does this by using a circuit called a divider. A divider is a device that takes a number of pulses and divides it into a smaller number of pulses. This is called ""division"" because it's like taking a number and dividing it into a smaller number. This is the same idea as when you divide a pizza into a smaller number of pieces, or when you divide a group of people into smaller groups.  ","There is a special elements called a quartz. It is the same thing that beach sand is made of. It has a special property of converting different Energies. With pressure it turns into heat, with light it splits light, and with electricity it creates a vibration. Some quartz crystals make a very stable vibration. Imagine one of these quartz could do 1000 times the second perfectly. We learned how to measure that has had to turn that into a clock. You may be familiar with counting seconds as one one thousand or one alligator. Running electricity through a piece of quartz crystal splits one second into to one thousand beats per second. By making a device that can separate every 1000 beats we can create a stable clock. Typical household digital clocks do not rely on quartz crystals for timekeeping. These clocks sample the AC voltage from the wall outlet. The frequency of this voltage is very well controlled at 50 or 60 Hz (varies by country) The clock measures the passage of time by counting how many times the electricity cycles. After 50 or 60 cycles, one second has gone by and the clock updates the display accordingly. The power distribution company strives to keep the frequency correct since varying frequency has a negative impact on the performance of the grid. The clock is incredibly accurate because of this. Interestingly, old style electric motor clocks also exhibited high accuracy for the same reason. In this case, though, a synchronous motor is used that spins once for each voltage cycle. 50 or 60 revolutions then equated to one second, so time could be mechanically displayed very accurately.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.46, 'recall': 33.57, 'fmeasure': 37.88}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.39, 'recall': 7.25, 'fmeasure': 8.18}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.16, 'recall': 14.8, 'fmeasure': 16.7}}"
How does car's speedometer & tachometer work?,"The speedometer is a mechanical device. It's a small gear that is attached to the axle of the transmission, and another gear that is attached to the wheels. As the wheels turn, the gear attached to the axle turns, and the gear attached to the wheels turns, but at a slightly slower rate. This is called a reduction gear, and it's used to increase the torque of the transmission, so that the engine can turn the wheels. When the transmission is in neutral, the speedometer will turn the same rate as the wheels. When the transmission is in gear, the speedometer will turn slower than the wheels, because the reduction gear is slowing the speedometer down. The tachometer is a digital device. It's a small computer that is connected to the engine, and it's able to measure the rotations of the engine per minute. It's able to do this by measuring the voltage of the engine, and then converting that voltage into rotations per minute. When the engine is running, the tachometer will display the rotations per minute, and when the engine is not running, it will display the number 0.","Older analogue: have a small gearing system that manually winds around at a known ratio to the wheel, and thus the wheel diameter. From this the speed is known Newer digital: have a beam (most likely light) being broken. If you know what time it is, and how long since the light was last broken _and_ you know what is breaking the light you can work out the speed of the object. Just wanted to add that the speedometers are calibrated to the specific size tires that your vehicle comes with from the factory. If you change the size of your tires then your speed will be off. Larger tires will cause your speed to be faster than your speedometer says, and smaller tires will cause you to be slower. The old analog gauges used a cable from the transmission to the speedometer. The cable was a long flexible wire inside a housing. The cable would connect to a small gear adapter that connected to the transmission. As you drive the transmission would spin the gears in the adapter this would spin the cable which would spin the speedometer. On modern cars there is a speed sensor on the transmission. It consists of a magnet and a metal toothed ring .As the ring spins it creates a current in the magnetic sensor the speedometer uses this signal to display the correct speed. Tachometers used a cable attached to a rotating part on the engine such as the camshaft. Then they used an electrical signal from the ignition coil. Now they use the same type of sensor as the speedometer. There are usually two sensors that tell the engine computer how fast the engine is spinning. The camshaft and crankshaft sensors. The tachometer uses the signal from one or both of these sensors to display the rpm.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 54.59, 'recall': 34.97, 'fmeasure': 42.63}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.9, 'recall': 10.16, 'fmeasure': 12.4}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.57, 'recall': 18.3, 'fmeasure': 22.31}}"

The Otto Cycle,"is the four stages of combustion in an internal combustion engine. (The Otto Cycle is named after its inventor, Gottlieb Daimler, who patented it in 1885, but it was actually invented by Karl Benz, who filed a patent for it in 1878.) The Otto Cycle is used in most modern internal combustion engines, including gasoline engines, diesel engines, and some specialized engines like rotary engines. The four stages of the Otto Cycle are: 1. Intake: Air and fuel are drawn into the engine's cylinders. The piston moves downward, creating a vacuum that pulls the mixture of air and fuel into the cylinder. The air/fuel mixture is usually a mixture of gasoline and air, with a ratio of about 14.5 parts air to 1 part fuel. 2. Compression: The air/fuel mixture is compressed by the piston, which moves upward. The fuel is ignited by the heat generated by the compressed air. 3. Power: The ignited fuel is burned, creating a rapid increase in pressure and temperature in the cylinder. The piston moves downward, which rotates the engine's crankshaft.  ","A [wiki gif]( URL_0 ) will help with this You start at 1, that is cylinder up with no fuel in it. 1-2 the intake valve opens and cylinder fills with the air gas mixture. The pressure is always atmospheric pressure so it is a horizontal line on the graph(1 in gif) 2-3 the intake valve closes and the piston pushes up compressing the mixture. The shrinking volume and increasing pressure creates the lower curved line.(2 in gif) 3-4 the spark plug fires causing the gas to combust. The piston doesn't move so volume stays constant while pressure increases significantly(you see the spark in the gif) 4-5 is the power stroke where the high pressure gas pushes the piston down to increase the volume and reduce the pressure, this makes the upper curved line on the graph(3 in gif) 5-6 is shown in the graph to get you back to your starting pressure and temperature. In reality we don't have an infinite ideal heatsink to put on the cylinder head to get all the energy out which results in less efficient engines and hot exhaust. This is not shown in the gif. 6-1 would be the exhaust stroke where the valve opens and the used air/gas mix is expelled from the cylinder at standard pressure, only the volume of the cylinder decreases so you get a horizontal line again.

Why do you lose less power to resistance when transmitting high voltages than when transmitting high currents?,"]( URL_0 ) > > Voltage is the potential difference between two points. Current is the flow of charge. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred, and is equal to voltage multiplied by current. The higher the voltage, the less the current. So the higher the voltage, the less the power.","The `V` in `P = V^2 / R` isn't the line voltage, it's the voltage drop across the line. Very important detail. The higher you can drive the voltage, the lower the current. The lower the current, the lower the voltage drop. > Why is it that when talking about resistance losses, formulas always frame current as the independent variable, but not voltage? Largely to avoid the mistake many people make by assuming resistive loss uses voltage and not the voltage drop across the component. If you transfer at a higher voltage then the current flowing is lower. If you transfer at a lower voltage then the current is higher. So, say for instance for every 100 amps you lose 1 volt. If you have a high voltage and 100 amps flowing then you have only list 1 volt. But if our voltage was lower so that now we need to flow 10,000 amps to get the same amount of power, we have just lost 100 volts in our wires. Either way the voltage drop for a given cable will be the same no matter what voltage is present. It is the current r flowing which will determine the voltage drop.

What is 'cold working' & 'hot working'?,"Cold working is working with metals at room temperature. This can include things like cutting, grinding, filing, and polishing. Hot working is working with metals at high temperatures. This can include things like forging, casting, and welding.  ","It very simply refers to the temperature a metal is worked at. Cold working means simply working the metal as it is, hot working means working it when it's hot. Hot working obviously requires the metal to be heated, but makes it softer, as well as leaving less residual internal stresses behind (by heating the metal, internal stresses can be allowed to resolve). Cold working typically creates internal stresses. Previous answers are correct. If you mash a piece of metal that's cold, you create microscopic weak points in it, as you are basically ripping apart tiny crystals (extra-strong solid regions) that form within the metal. If you mash a piece of metal that's hot, new crystals tend to form as it cools off in the new shape, so you don't get those tiny stress fractures in the final product. Depending on how you heated and cooled it, the metal can end up harder or softer than it started. Metal is really hard, but not so hard you can't bend or mold it. Sometimes you can change it's shape by hitting it with a hammer, sometimes you can bend it by hand. Doing this is called working the metal. Metal becomes softer and easier to bend if you heat it, so you can hit hot metal and change it's shape, hot working. If you don't need to heat it, such as bending a paperclip that's cold working. Each changes the inside of the metal differently leaving it more or less likely to bend or break, how brittle it is.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.24, 'recall': 5.97, 'fmeasure': 10.49}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.56, 'recall': 0.75, 'fmeasure': 1.32}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.73, 'recall': 4.1, 'fmeasure': 7.21}}"
Why do electronics crash when overclocked too much?,"It's like when you put a lot of weight in a box, eventually the box will break, even if you put a little weight in it at a time. The computer is like a box. When you put a lot of weight in it, eventually it will break. The weight in this case is the work it has to do. The faster you want the computer to do work, the more work it has to do. If you put too much weight in it, eventually it will break. The computer will crash.","If it doesn't outright overheat, the way a computer works is by organizing its action into clock cycles. Everything in the computer is designed to work within those cycles, so that when the next cycle starts, each part has finished it's share of the work and is ready to pass its result on and start on the next chunk of computation. At some point, speeding things up will cause some component to be unable to finish in time, and this can often lead to a catastrophic failure of the logic of the computer... i.e. it crashes. As /u/1_km_coke_line indicated, one reason is overheating. Running integrated circuits at unusually high frequencies or voltages can cause them to get hotter than they were designed/tested for. Ideally when this happens, the OS or BIOS on the computer sees that things are getting too hot and throttles back or shuts down. Sometimes the heat rise happens too fast or too locally for it to get recognized in time and the computer crashes. In a worst-case scenario, there can be permanent physical damage due to the excessive heat. But that's not the only possibility. Integrated circuits (such as a microprocessor) are generally designed to work in a kind of cadence, with the clock setting the beat. This avoids situations where different signals arriving into a sub-circuit at slightly different times cause it to change state when it shouldn't. The clock acts as a gatekeeper, basically saying ""OK, now is the time to evaluate the inputs and react accordingly"". This is called ""synchronous circuit design"". The clock gets split up into different ""[phases]( URL_0 )"", and different parts of the circuit are hooked up to different ones. That way, when one set of circuits feeds into another set, they don't all try to change at once and get confused. When you overclock, you risk screwing this up. Things start happening faster than the circuits were designed for, and incorrect operation can happen. This is made even worse by the fact that overclocking heats things up, and circuits slow down as they get hotter. This incorrect operation can cause data corruption and all other kinds of bad behavior. Including causing a crash. A third, much less likely scenario is that the clock circuit itself will misbehave when overclocked. The clock signal being fed into a microprocessor is fairly high frequency (although not as high as the internal clock frequency). If the overclocking is done by telling the motherboard to speed up the clock, the quality of the signal can degrade to the point that the processor isn't getting a ""clean"" enough clock signal to recognize it. But a lot of time this isn't how overclocking is even done. They overheat. resistance in the various circuits becomes too high with increased temperature, causing them to get even hotter during continued use. Eventually the boards/circuits will be damaged by the high temperatures and stop working. In transistors, there is something called propogation delay. It is the time it takes from the switching signal being sent to the time the transistor actually activates or deactivates. This is a very short period of time, but processors tend to act near the margin of stability. Overclocking does 2 things. It shortens the period of each clock cycle, which may outright exceed the propogation delay of the transistors (sort of like if you only left yourself 5 minutes to making a connecting flight, the signal won't make it from the first transistor set to the 2nd set). The other is the increased cycle rate increases the power consumption and therefore the heat of the processor. Increased heat leads to longer propogation delays. In our plane example, this would be like having to fly around a storm, lengthening the flight time. This is why you can overclock more at lower temperatures, things like liquid nitrogen shorten the propagation delay of the transistors.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 72.04, 'recall': 10.08, 'fmeasure': 17.68}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.22, 'recall': 2.11, 'fmeasure': 3.7}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.78, 'recall': 5.56, 'fmeasure': 9.76}}"
"How does a Torque converter, convert torque?","I'm not sure what you mean by ""torque converter"", but I'll give it a shot. A torque converter is a mechanical device that is used to transfer rotational energy from a power source (such as a engine) to a load (such as a transmission). It works by converting the rotational energy of the engine into a fluid flow, which is then converted back into rotational energy by a set of blades.   fluid flow is generated by a set of turbines that are driven by the engine.   turbines are connected to the engine by a shaft.   fluid flow is then directed through a series of valves to the transmission.   valves control the flow of fluid through the transmission, which controls the gear ratio of the transmission.   gear ratio determines how fast the transmission is spinning compared to the engine.   faster the transmission spins compared to the engine, the higher the gear ratio.   slower the transmission spins compared to the engine, the lower the gear ratio. By changing the gear ratio, you can change the speed of the transmission. By changing the speed of the transmission, you can change the speed of the vehicle.   torque converter is a very simple device.   power source is the engine.   load is the transmission.   torque converter is the fluid flow.   fluid flow is generated by the turbines in the engine.  ","The simplest way to explain it is it's two fans facing each other. Power is applied to one fan, that blows fluid by the other fan and it spins. In real life they are very close and tightly located next to each other so the fluid can only flow through the fan blades. The unsaid part of the name is that the torque converter converts horsepower into torque. The input shaft is spinning faster, making more horsepower and the fluid couples it to the output shaft, which is turning more slowly, but with more torque. It works identically to a using a higher gear ratio (lower gear), but with the benefit of being a variable conversion ratio but with the downside of being much less efficient.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 27.43, 'recall': 48.82, 'fmeasure': 35.13}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.89, 'recall': 8.73, 'fmeasure': 6.27}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.04, 'recall': 26.77, 'fmeasure': 19.26}}"
How do they light rockets in space?," tl;dr: Solar panels and nuclear reactors. I've worked on the International Space Station, and we use solar panels. They're actually more efficient than we expected, so we've been able to increase the amount of power they generate. We also have nuclear reactors, which are used to generate electricity. They're not used to power rockets, but they are used to power the space station. The space station is a large, complex piece of equipment that requires a lot of power. We use the reactors to generate electricity, and then use that electricity to power the station. The reactors are actually pretty cool. They're called ""Rassvet"", which is Russian for ""morning"". They're Russian-designed, and they're Russian-built. They're actually a lot like the reactors used on Russian submarines. They're also the only nuclear reactors that are used in space.

"why is a tail wing on an aircraft necessary? I’m talking about the physically vertical one, like can’t a pilot just use the roll to steer and keep the plane stabilized?","Because it's not just a roll. The plane is also pitching, which is the angle of the nose relative to the horizon. The tail wing helps stabilize the plane by counteracting the pitch. If you have a plane that's pitching up, the tail wing will help bring the nose down. If you have a plane that's pitching down, the tail wing will help bring the nose up. The tail wing also helps the plane to maintain a steady pitch during a turn. When the plane rolls, the nose will also pitch up or down. The tail wing helps to counteract this by pushing against the nose, and keeping it steady.","The vertical stabilizer is used for yaw stability. The airplane can rotate around three different axes. The rotation where the nose goes up or down is called pitch. The rotation where the wings go up or down is called roll. The (much less common) rotation where the whole plane spins in a circle around the middle of the fuselage is called yaw. You probably didn't even really think about yaw because it's not a big part of usual aircraft operation. But without the vertical stabilizer, if a gust of wind hit the front or back of the plane, it could start spinning like a Frisbee very easily, and that can be [very difficult to come out of, and very difficult to survive.]( URL_0 ) The tail stabilizer is just the easiest and best way of keeping the plane stable.

What are some of the factors that led to a noticeable drop in quality in American automobiles?,"The American car industry in the 70s was heavily regulated, and the government required a certain percentage of vehicles to be made in the US.

Meanwhile, Japanese manufacturers were able to sell cars cheaply because they didn't have to invest in expensive machinery and also didn't have to pay their workers as much.

Why can't quieter leaf blowers be engineered?," In the world of engineering, there are a few different approaches to designing something. The first is called ""form follows function"". This is a very old approach that dates back to the early days of engineering and architecture. It's the idea that the form of a building or machine is directly related to the function of the machine or building. This is a very simple approach, and it's often used to design things that are relatively simple. The second approach is called ""form follows function, but also form follows form"". This is a bit more complicated, and it's often used to design things that are a bit more complex. The idea is that the form of the machine or building is related to its function, but it's also related to the form of other machines or buildings. For example, an airplane is designed to fly through the air, so its form is related to the function of flying. But it's also related to the form of other airplanes, so it's designed to be able to fly with other airplanes. The third approach is called ""form follows function, but also form follows function"". This is the most complicated approach, and it's often used to design things that are very complex. The idea is that the form of the machine or building is related to its function, but it's also related to the form of other machines or buildings.  ","Your ears detect changes in pressure, a leaf blower moving air at x mph creates a rather large change in pressure and therefore a lot of noise. A car creates large changes in pressure as well, but there contained within each cylinder which is why we can design muffler systems to make them quieter. As for other lawn equipment, it’s simply because muffflers are pretty big and thus most small engines don’t have mufflers that are as effective. Though there do exist muffled generators that have complete mufflers. They actually have rather quiet leaf blowers. They are newer and correct me if I am wrong, but electric powered. I couldn’t answer to how they compare in wind power and efficiency unfortunately. Lawn equipment, especially leaf-blowers, are designed to be light enough to be comfortably operated by one person. It is much easier and lighter to slap ear protection on the operator than it is to build a system that muffles the noise of the engine. Electric leafblowers are much quieter than gas-powered leafblowers because they aren't powered by explosions. You wouldn't be able to muffle the fan, however, without defeating it's whole purpose to blow out a lot of air.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 21.63, 'recall': 25.48, 'fmeasure': 23.4}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.28, 'recall': 3.86, 'fmeasure': 3.55}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.29, 'recall': 16.83, 'fmeasure': 15.45}}"
how do countries import or export electricity ?,"Electricity is a form of energy, and is not something you can physically export or import. Countries do not trade electricity, they trade the fuel that generates the electricity. So the US does not import or export electricity, it imports and exports natural gas, coal, oil, and uranium. Those fuels are then burned to produce electricity.","The high voltage power grids are usually connected over borders, so that they can simply send power over the wires as needed and then pay for the power afterwards. Just like the power meter in your house can measure the electricity going in to your house, you can do the exact same thing (but, you know, with heavier measuring instruments) on a high voltage cable that runs across a border. So, basically. At every point where a new buyer is connected, you add a power meter and measure how much they use. That the cable runs across a border is typically completely worthless information. No-one cares about that. The important bit is that when one grid owner takes over from another, the new grid owner has to cough up for what they import into their own grid. I have an example, I'll try to simplify it so that it's easy to follow it. In Sweden, power grid above a certain voltage is owned by a power company that is controlled by the government. Their purpose is to ensure that all the power companies, large power producers and other nations national grids can buy and sell to each other in realtime. They don't care particular much about how the trade happens, but their job is to ensure that everyone can trade. The actual balancing (that is, the calculations that ensure that enough production happens to meet demand) is done by another entity and how they cooperate there is beyond the scope of this reasoning. For historical reasons, a lot of the production takes place in hydro plants in rivers far up north in the country while a lot of the consumption happens in the more urbanized areas in the south. This means that there is a constant need for producers up north to transmit to the south. So, the grid company has a power meter at each entry point. Measuring how much is put in and measuring how much is withdrawn. Electricity is damn hard to store, and sometimes there is a grid failure. And a plant has to close down for maintenance real quick. You know, things that make it important that you can grab electricity from someplace else. For that reason, we got connections to Norway, Finland, Denmark and Germany. I think there is a baltic connection too, but I'm too lazy to look it up. So, if we need more electricity than we are able to produce, we contact producers in Norway and ask for more production. Or Finland. Or Denmark. Or, in a worst scenario from Germany where electricity is usually a lot more expensive. The germans have a historical habit of buying all of our surplus, because our electricity is a whole lot cheaper than theirs. (or, well. it was anyway. I'm not sure now.) The day after, THEY found have a plant that stops and have to buy from us. But, well. The general idea is that if you connect everything to the same backbone and measure in which direction the flow goes and charge accordingly, it unifies the buyers and the sellers into an international market. A market that, at least in theory, functions better because there are more players on it that all understand how they rely on each other. There's a sort of secondary way to do this. If a country can generate more electricity than it needs, it can use the excess to smelt aluminum and then export the aluminum. Electricity doesn't decide where to go, no one can tell a current flow to go in a certain place or in another place. The only thing that can be done is decide how much a certain country's power plants need to produce. Then when countries want to buy electricity from other countries they buy it from stock market. Let's make an easy example: Mexico wants to buy electricity from USA Let's say that U.S.A. and Mexico want to turn on a 100 W to light bulb; U.S.A. has power plants capable to produce 300 W and Mexico can produce 50 W. One day before, Mexico opens the stock market app and buys 50 watts of electricity from USA for a certain price (intersection between demand and offer curves) to be supplied in a specific interval of time (let's say during the night). The TNO (transmission network operator) will then check the stock transaction to determine if electrical lines interested in the exchanges can be safely used (current in a line must be below a threshold), let's say it is for simplicity, at this point the USA power plant can produce the extra amount to sell it to Mexico. At the end of the day, the power plants interested in the transaction will raise their production rate to fulfill the established exchange of the stock market. USA will produce 150 watts and Mexico will produce 50 watts, both USA and Mexico light bulbs will be lit on!","{'rouge1': {'precision': 62.5, 'recall': 4.16, 'fmeasure': 7.8}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.73, 'recall': 0.83, 'fmeasure': 1.56}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 42.86, 'recall': 2.85, 'fmeasure': 5.35}}"
"Why stapling papers only works with a quick movement, but if we do it slowly it just creates a twisted mess?","The reason it works is that the staple is actually a spring. When you move the stapler quickly, the spring snaps back into shape. If you move it slowly, the spring doesn't get the chance to snap back into shape, and thus is not able to hold the papers together. When you try to move the stapler slowly, you are actually moving the staple slowly, and it doesn't have enough time to snap back into shape, so it can't hold the paper together.","Doing it slowly gives the paper time to deform in response which is what causes the tangled mess. Paper can deform while the staple is much more resistant to deformation, so if you do it quickly, the stapler can just rip through the paper since it is moving with more force than the paper can contain. If you push too slowly, it doesn't tear through the paper right away so the paper has a chance to deform and stretch around the pressure, distributing the force over a larger surface area.

how does a car turbo work?,"A turbocharger is a turbine that uses exhaust gases to drive a compressor. The compressor is connected to the engine's intake system.

The exhaust gases are used to drive the turbine, which in turn drives the compressor. The compressor is connected to the turbine by a shaft, which is connected to the engine's crankshaft. As the engine rotates the crankshaft, it also rotates the shaft, which rotates the compressor. The compressor is connected to the engine's intake system.

","Pretty much like in an RV. There are tanks to hold clean water, typically refilled with a hose at the ends of the line. These are usually mounted above the sinks and toilets, so gravity delivers the water. The drains all connect to storage tanks under the cars, which are pumped out at the end of the line. I can chime in on this as I maintain trains for a living. Trains are filled on either end of the train set via a potable fill inlet. The water is then pressurized (for our train sets it's set at 4.5 bar) . To fill you purge the water system of air via cutout cocks or valves . Fill the water until it is spitting out the bottom much like an rv and an overfill hole. Then you return the cutout cocks to position to bring the system back to a pressurized 4.5bar supplying the trainset with water Trains, like planes, have storage tanks for potable water. These are refilled either at major stops, or back at the yard at the end of the day. They also have waste storage tanks to captures the waste water, and that is pumped out, again at designated stops or back at the yard. There would be a pair of tanks like that at each car with a restroom in it. As far as ""management"", the fixtures are often low-flow types to use as little water as possible. From a summer maintaining railcars: every individual car has a potable water tank for sinks and bars and blackwater tank for toilets. The Grey water (soapy water or rinse water) was fed in a drain system that emptied onto the track below. All of the cars were outfitted with valves on either end to hook up to a flexible food grade hose that would sit slack between the cars. We would have to bleach all fittings before hooking up hoses to the fill ports and when connecting two cars.

"When connecting high voltage batteries in parallel using connecting wires, is it better to start connecting from the positive terminal or the negative terminal?","It doesn't matter. The positive terminal of a battery is where the positive electrode (the one with the more positive charge) is, and the negative terminal is where the negative electrode is. Connecting the positive terminal of one battery to the negative terminal of another battery will cause a flow of electrons (current) from the negative terminal of the first battery to the positive terminal of the second battery, and vice versa. This is because of the difference in the voltage between the two batteries, which causes the electrons to flow. The polarity of the batteries doesn't matter, because the electrons will always flow from the more positive terminal of the battery to the more negative terminal.","From a safety standpoint its best to connect the ground first, so as soon as the circuit goes ""hot"" it has a ground ready to go.

How does pressing down on the gas-pedal result in faster piston movement?,"You're right, the piston movement is dependent on the crankshaft movement. The crankshaft is connected to the piston by a rod. When the crankshaft moves, it rotates the rod, which moves the piston. So when you press the gas pedal, you're actually moving the crankshaft. The way that this works is that when you press the pedal, the crankshaft rotates faster, which causes the rod to move faster. This movement of the rod is what moves the piston, which is what causes the engine to make power. So the pedal is essentially just a way to control the crankshaft's movement.","Fuel. Pressing the throttle opens a valve, allowing more fuel which creates a bigger combustion inside the engine, pushing the pistons harder and resulting higher rpms. (Agreed, more fuel and air). The throttle controls the [Butterfly Valve]( URL_0 ) which allows more air to move past it the more it is opened. Or in other words, pushing down on the throttle causes the valve to open more, allowing more air to the engine.

What are neural networks? Specifically RNNs.,"Neural networks are a way to model a problem by using a bunch of interconnected nodes. Each node takes in some input, and it uses the input to make a prediction. The prediction is then used to update the input. This process is repeated many times, and the final prediction is the output. The way that the nodes are connected is important. The nodes are connected in a way that allows them to learn from each other. This is called a ""neural network"". Neural networks are a way of modeling the brain. The brain is a very complex organ, and it is not well understood. However, we do know that it has a lot of neurons, and each neuron has a lot of connections to other neurons. Neural networks are a way of modeling this complexity. The key to neural networks is that they are a way of modeling the brain. They are not a way of modeling the world. For example, a neural network is not a way of modeling a car. It is a way of modeling the brain. A neural network is a way of modeling the brain. The brain is made of neurons, and each neuron has a lot of connections to other neurons. A neural network is a way of modeling these connections. A neural network is a way of modeling the brain.  ing the world.  ","The little league team you coach just won the big game, and you ask them if they want to go out for pizza or for burgers. Each kid starts screaming their preference, and you go with whatever was the loudest. This is basically how a neural net works but on multiple levels. The top-level nodes get some input, each detects a certain property and screams when it sees it...the more intense the property, the louder they scream. Now you have a bunch of nodes screaming ""it's dark!"", ""it's has red!"", ""it's roundish!"" as various volumes. The next level listens and based on what they hear they start screaming about more complex features. ""It has a face!"", ""It has fur"", until finally get to a level where it is screaming ""It's a kitty!"". The magic part is no one tells them when to scream, it is based on feedback. Your little league team went for burgers, and some of them got sick. Next week, they might not scream for burgers, or might not scream as loudly. They have collectively learned that burgers might not have been a great choice, and are more likely to lean away from the option. A neural net gets training in much the same way. You feed it a bunch of kitty and non-kitty pictures. If the net gets it right, the nodes are reinforced so they are more likely to do the same thing in similar situations. If it is wrong, they get disincentivized. Initially, its results will be near random, but if you have designed it correctly, it will get better and better as the nodes adjust. You often have neural nets that work without any human understanding exactly how. The current top analogy is so unrelated to neural networks that it doesn't help, so let me try expand on it: Imagine someone is looking at an object, like a cat. They write down lots of traits that the object has - for example, ""four legs"", ""furry"", ""brown"", ""has whiskers"", etc. Now let's say you want to make a machine that, when given that list, will figure out what the object is. The simplest way to make that machine is obvious: make a list of qualities for every object in the world, and then have the machine check which of those lists matches the one you just wrote for that cat. It'd work, but obviously this is far too much work to do. So you think ""Hey, a lot of these objects have a lot in common - why do I need to make separate lists for each one?"" So instead, you have lots of smaller machines that only asks one question. For example, a machine that checks ""Is this an animal?"", and it'll see if ""is breathing"" or ""has a heartbeat"" or such are on the list, and say ""Yes, this is an animal"". And then there's another machine that checks ""Is this a mammal"", and that'll ask the animal-checking machine for if it's an animal and then check the list for ""has hair"". Some machines would only check the list, and some would ask many other machines for their answers, and some would do both. And eventually, just from machines-asking-machines-asking-machines, you have a final machine that answers with ""Yes, this is a cat"". ...Of course, even making those smaller machines is still too much work for categorising every object in the world, so instead you try have it build itself - using random guesses for what the categories should be - until you end up with a working system. This can result in crazy smaller machines, like one that might ask ""Does it have two legs, two arms, and nose hair longer than 3.5cm?"", but it should overall work fairly similar to the cat-detecting model I just talked about. Right, now as for Recurrent Neural Networks, it's pretty simple: it's exactly the same as what I just said, but where smaller machines can also ask questions from the *previous* list's answers. For example, in voice recognition, one machine might go the ""It is/isn't an 'ow' sound"" machine and instead ask ""Was the *previous* thing he said an 'ow' sound?"". (The one thing I didn't mention is that most small machines would actually have answers in a probability rather than yes/no, but that's not true for all neural networks.) Let me give this a try. Neural networks are a computing architecture inspired by biological brains, although they are not an exact replica. The brain is a network of connected cells called neurons. Each neuron takes input from other neurons. If the signal from all of the input neurons is strong enough, then it fires and sends its own signal to downstream neurons. Brains learn by creating and destroying connections between neurons, and altering the strength of existing connections. Neural networks are simpler than biological neurons, but they are inspired by the same principle. A neural network takes input in the form of numerical data. It passes that input through multiple layers of neurons. Each neuron adds up the input from the layer above it, and sends its own output to the layer below. Eventually the last layer in the stack produces an output. The network learns by a process called back-propagation. To train a network, you show it samples of input, and the matching samples of output. Back-propagation alters the strength of connections between individual neurons so as to reduce the error between the sample output (""what the output should have been"") and the actual output that the network produced when it saw the sample input. After many, many such training iterations, the network may have configured its connections (or ""weights"") so that it is able to make meaningful correspondences between inputs and outputs. As a simple example, a neural network might learn to recognize cows by looking at a series of pictures. Some of those pictures are cows and some are not. The pictures are turned into numbers (pixel by pixel) and passed into the top layer. The output from the bottom layer will have a signal strength that is interpreted as ""yes, cow"" or ""no, not cow"". If the network got it right or wrong, the connections that helped/hurt the conclusion are strengthened/weakened accordingly. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is the same concept, with one extension. The neurons don't just process the input coming from the layer above, but also connect back to themselves so that they have a way to ""remember"" their prior states and prior input. There are various specialized neurons such as long short-term memories (LSTMs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), etc that accomplish this in fairly sophisticated ways. Hope this helps? Happy to explain in vastly more detail any part that you like. I realize this answer isn't literally meant for a five year old but I hope it's accessible to most non-technical adults. The insight behind neural networks is that if you take a bunch of simple equations that each do a tiny little bit of processing (like adding up the results of other equations and tweaking the value based on its size), and you stack enough of them together, they can do pretty much anything you want. You just need to find the right ""settings"" or ""weights"" for them so they do the specific thing you want instead of something else. We've discovered special rules that let us take the output values we want and the input values we want and adjust the math in between to make the whole network more likely to produce the desired output when it's fed the desired input. Repeating this over many input-output examples eventually leads the network to ""generalize"" - i.e. to capture the structure of the information so well that it can work on inputs it hasn't seen before. A ""neural network"" is just a big stack of these simple equations that have been tuned using one of these special rules to map a particular set of input and output examples together. Once it's ""trained"" in this manner, it can be used on new examples to do useful work without needing human judgement. An RNN (or recurrent neural network) is simply an extension of this, where the network is solving a problem that takes place over many steps, so many copies of the network are initialized in sequence, each being fed some information from the past copy like a colossal game of telephone, letting it preserve some ""memories"" from the past and make multiple outputs before stopping. As an example, you can use an RNN to generate text. If you feed it text one letter at a time, and train it to predict the next letter of the text, it'll eventually get pretty good at it: it'll ""remember"" some information about the letters that came before, and use that context to make a guess at the next letter. Once it's trained, you can feed it its own output as input (basically telling it ""you were right"" after each guess) and it'll happily spit out line after line of text that structurally resembles the text it was trained on. I'll try and start from a real simple overview-explanation and work my way down to more and more specifics. Basically, a Neural Network is a system that is able to learn a complex function from a large set of examples. Let's say you have a couple of thousand pictures of cats and another couple thousand pictures of dogs. Each image has a label, e.g. 'cat' or 'dog', although that would be represented by a number, so cats are -1 and dogs are 1 or whatever. You feed these pictures through the network, which for now is just a black box for us, and it gives you an estimate of what the picture shows. (It spits out a number between -1 and 1, in this simple case.) In the beginning of the training process, the result is going to be random. But the network is punished every time it gives a wrong answer and changes some of its parameters, and gradually, over time, the accuracy improves. After a couple of thousand training iterations (that is, feeding an image in, receiving an answer, punishing/rewarding the network, adjusting parameters) the network has learned to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Now, how does that work? The smallest part of a network is a neuron. A neuron is a really basic thing, it takes in a couple of inputs, sums over them and pushes that sum through a nice little function, a sigmoid for example or a ReLU. (You might wanna google these to look at a graph, a sigmoid is just a function that is shaped like an S. It squishes inputs from the real numbers to the interval between 0 and 1, for example) So, for example, five numbers go in and one number comes out. The simplest network you could construct contains only one neuron. This is where the magic happens: before the inputs are summed up, they are weighted, that is, multiplied with some real number. So, for example, our network receives the inputs 4, 5 and 6. Those might be the values of pixels in an image. They might be the height and length of the animal we are trying to classify. They might be < insert other example here > , doesn't matter, its just data. 4 is multiplied by -1.3, 5 is multiplied by 2.1, 6 is multiplied by 0.4. (You might be asking where those weights come from, I'll get to that in a minute) Now, we sum over those weighted inputs and push that through a sigmoid, out comes another number. In a really simple network with only one neuron, that number would already be the networks output: something close to 1 for a dog, something close to -1 for a cat. In more complex networks, the output of this neuron would be the input to the next neuron, in the next layer. There can be millions of neurons in large, complex state-of-the-art networks. The important point to take home is: numbers are multiplied and summed up, the result is squished and then fed forward to the next layer. This is why this process is called feed forward. But I promised to explain where the weights come from. Truth is: In the beginning, those are random numbers. Which explains why the output of those networks in the early stages is pure garbage. The interesting thing is how those weights are adapted, and for that we use an algorithm that is called backpropagation. What basically happens is that the output of the network is compared to the actual label of the image (or data point, to be more general). So, we calculate the error that the system made. That error is propagated back through the layers, and those weights that are responsible for the error are adjusted. (To be even more specific, ELIlikemath or so: The weights span a vector space called the weight surface. We can use calculus to relate the error that the system makes to the constellation of weights. There is a combination of weights that leads to the smallest possible error, and that combination of weights corresponds to a valley in the high dimensional vector space. We can calculate the gradient of the network function to walk downhill in that vector space) Depending on how the neurons are connected in the network, we give it a different name. What I just described is just a Multilayer Perceptron, MLP for short, the vanilla version. More complex version are Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs, and Recurrent Neural Networks, RNNs. I am no expert on RNNs, the basic idea is that it is possible for information to flow through the network backwards as well, I think. Edit: added paragraphs, was not aware of the fact that you have to add a blank line **Actual ELI5:** You know those stupid captchas? They have you select boxes--which ones have signs, which ones have trees, etc. By looking at them, you know which ones to select. Even if you could only see what's in each box individually, you would be able to figure out pretty well whether or not there's a tree there because we've seen trees before (training data). So, let's say we have an image and we know what trees look like, even when we can only see a little box of the image. Now, we have a new picture. We start off with a teeny tiny box--not sure, but we've learned something. Then, we get bigger boxes over the entire image--we've learned a little more. There's something that looks textured like bark, something that could be a leaf. Even a larger box now--okay, we can tell that those are clusters of leaves and here's an entire branch. Now we know it's a tree. Let's say that now, we have a video. We figured out that the picture is of a tree, but now we want to know if the next frame also has a tree. If you're smart, you think ""of course!"" not that much can change from frame to frame. So we look at the next picture in the video and do the process over again, except this time, we know, ""hey, this box said it had bark texture or a leaf shape last time"" and we can figure out if it's the same this time. . . . If you want the tedious explanation: **Neural Nets:** an input (images, a sentence, etc.) goes into a series of nodes in hidden layers, which output what you want (yes/no, things that are discrete - classification, a regression - possibilities, various values, etc.). What happens in the hidden layers, broadly, is that in the first layers, features are made by some mathematical process. Further layers would generalize upon features, getting more and more abstract. A NN can be as small as 3 layers (input -- > hidden -- > output) or larger like what you see with CNNs. CNNs are a specific kind of NN that use convolutions of different sizes (matrix size) and strides (how far each convolution occurs from one another). Imagine a convolution as a box going over an image--it can be 5x5 pixels big or 25x25 pixels big or 2x2 pixels big and move over 1 pixel at a time or 20 pixels at a time. Each of these decisions end up affecting what features are output. There are other parameters to tune like learning rate (how fast things are learned--too fast and one bad training example can screw you up, too slow and it just takes forever to get a functioning CNN), momentum, weights, etc. In networks, everything is initialized randomly. Then, as training data goes in, each layer of nodes gets their numbers changed by these mathematical processes. Epochs are how many times you run your training data through, you do it until you reach a plateau, which you can determine by the validation accuracy plateau-ing (95% would be good, but if you plateau at 30%, you know you need to fix something--you don't just keep training and hope it gets better). **Reccurent Neural Networks:** These are particularly useful for things like sentences and videos, where what comes before and after are important. This is a broad area, so I'm not going to explain each one. RNNs are basically just NNs where the input data is not only your training data, but also what the output of previous/posterior nodes has been. There's a feedback loop connecting it to past decisions so that those are carried forward. The issue with these are that there are so many operations--you know how 2^10 = 1024, but 2^20 = 1048576. Imagine that, but on a huge scale, where the values of these nodes can quickly explode to huge numbers or vanish to near-zero. The following is supposed to solve that issue. LSTMs are a specific RNN that can learn long-term dependencies. We have a list (cell): they figure out which information we want to throw away from the list (forget gate) and what we want to add based on input data (input gate), and then update the list. As you run through it, some old bullet points of the list still make it through and some new ones are there too. But, how much the new items influence your list depends on a parameter you set. The gates start to learn how much data is supposed to flow and what should flow the way CNNs learn feature detectors. How does this solve numbers exploding or vanishing? It does so by adding functions instead of multiplying. So if one of your numbers is smaller or larger, it's no(t as big of a) biggie. Source: PhD student, this is my area. I can expand on more, but I figure things would get too long and I skipped over things like backpropagation and gradient because I figured the layperson wouldn't care. I got lazier and lazier...so the latter is a lot less specific, sorry! I'm going to try for an actual ELI5-level answer... artificial neural networks (or ANNs) are magic boxes that are full of magic numbers. These boxes have the following properties: 1.) They take some numerical inputs and give some numerical outputs 2.) They know how wrong their output is (""error"") 3.) Based on their error, they know roughly which direction each of their magic numbers should be adjusted to be less wrong Although these properties are actually the result of fairly straightforward algebra and calculus, neural networks can be surprisingly powerful for certain problems, especially when a bunch of them are stacked on top of one another (this is a ""deep"" neural network and does ""deep learning""). RNNs (recurrent neural networks) are the same as vanilla ANNs, except that they care about the order and context of their inputs. This makes them good for things like text processing (a regular ANN wouldn't care about the difference between ""the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"" and ""the quick brown dog jumped over the lazy fox""). The name and ""biologically-inspired"" label are sort of misleading... ANNs used to be called weighted matrices (and a lot of other things) a long time before they were associated with anything biological. It was only after we found out that they were particularly good at many of the same kinds of problems brains are (particularly vision and speech-related tasks) that we started calling them ""neural networks"". Also because it sounds cool. A neural network is a set of mathematical operations that maps a set of inputs to a set of outputs. They are useful because they can map _any_ set of inputs to _any_ set of outputs. The really interesting thing is that the ""weights"" of the network, which define how the inputs get transformed as they move through the set of computations, are adjustable. This means that you can take the outputs predicted by a network with one set of weights, compare them to the outputs it _should_ have given you, and then intelligently adjust the weights to get closer to the right answer next time. With enough repetitions of that process, you can ""train"" a neural network to do pretty incredible things, simply by showing it enough of the right data. An RNN is a special type of neural network called a ""Recurrent Neural Network."" A regular neural network can map one set of inputs to one set of outputs, and then it is done. An RNN takes the outputs from one ""time step,"" or one prediction, and feeds it back into the network along with the data for the next prediction. This gives it the ability to ""remember"" things it has seen recently in the context of new inputs. In other words, a regular neural network might be able to look at a picture and tell you whether there is a cat in it or not. An RNN could look at a series of pictures from a movie and tell you what the cat is doing in them. [These videos provide a decent introduction to neural nets in general]( URL_0 ) (I'm not sure if the series is complete or if he'll go into further details in future videos) ill try and eli5 this. basically neural networks are ways to solve problems by recognizing patterns. so suppose i want to solve an addition problem. i can write a series of steps like you may you have learned. write the numbers one on top of each other. start at the right and add down. carry 1s if the result is more than 10... that is a definite way to solve it and you get the exact answer. now some problems are really hard to write down such an exact method. things like identifying things in pictures. so you can use a neural network to figure out a pattern which can give you an answer. it maybe not be correct. but it tries. so you train the neural net with a bunch of inputs and correct outputs and it tries to learn the pattern. going back to the addition example. youd feed it data like. 1+1 = 2 3+4 =7 100 + 200 = 300 ... the more samples you give it to learn the better chance it has of a good answer. also the bigger the neural net (nodes) the better chance of a good answer suppose i just gave it the 3 values above to train on. then i asked it what is 50 + 10 it might come up with the answer 100. its not correct, but its not a bad estimate.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 85.28, 'recall': 4.89, 'fmeasure': 9.25}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 43.91, 'recall': 2.51, 'fmeasure': 4.75}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 58.01, 'recall': 3.33, 'fmeasure': 6.29}}"

How does hit detection work in first-person shooters?,"It's not really possible to accurately detect hits on a moving target. You'd have to have a very good idea of where the target is, and where you are, and you'd have to be able to calculate where the bullet would be when it hits. In practice, you just have to assume that you hit where you aimed, and that's that.","[check out this video by Gameranx that talk about bullet physics in games]( URL_0 ) the player basicly have a lazer pinting straight ahead, if a enemy is touching the lazer when the player press the trigger, the enemy will get hit. some realistic games have a delay from the player pulling the trigger to the enemy getting hit to give an effect of bullet travel time or bullet drop. There are many solutions to this, but usually there is one computer that acts as the server (if it's P2P then it's the hosting player, if it's dedicated servers then it's the actual server itself). The server is the only computer that calculates hit detection and has a complete picture of the whole game. Everyone else just sends and receives updates from it. So if you shoot someone, you don't actually do any calculations on your computer. Hell, you probably just tell the server that you pulled the trigger and it will create the bullet for himself and do all the necessary calculations without asking you for anything. And then, when the bullet collides (or not), it will just tell you that it collided (or not) and then your computer would draw the blood splash, or ragdoll the dead target, or whatever. The way ping factors into all of this is that: A) If you lag then it will receive you input message late and will spawn the bullet late, thus possibly missing your target. Nothing can be done about that. B) If your target lags, then it will need to do some smoothing to somewhat predict where they would be realistically, if they didn't lag at this very moment. Technically that is not hit detection, but should be mentioned anyway. In terms of ping, hits are calculated on the server, not on the client, which is how come you might see rubber banding on your game but still get hit by someone. The most basic games just simply draw a straight line from you to the target to see if you hit them. Some games take into account some physically effects. Star Citizen is the only game that I know of (though I'm sure there are others) that actually creates bullets as physical game objects and calculates physics on the bullets in that way. Pretty cool.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 69.23, 'recall': 11.42, 'fmeasure': 19.61}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.94, 'recall': 1.78, 'fmeasure': 3.06}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 35.38, 'recall': 5.84, 'fmeasure': 10.02}}"
"What is Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta Notation?","Big O, Omega, and Theta are used to describe the complexity of an algorithm. They are used to describe the rate at which the algorithm's running time increases. For example, an algorithm that runs in O(n^2) has a running time that grows quadratically with the size of the input. An algorithm that runs in O(n) has a running time that grows linearly with the size of the input. An algorithm that runs in Omega(n^2) has a running time that grows quadratically with the size of the input, but there is a constant factor of n^2 that is multiplied into the equation. An algorithm that runs in Omega(n) has a running time that grows linearly with the size of the input, but there is a constant factor of n. An algorithm that runs in Theta(n^2) has a running time that grows quadratically with the size of the input, but there is a constant factor of n^2 that is multiplied into the equation. An algorithm that runs in Theta(n) has a running time that grows linearly with the size of the input, but there is a constant factor of n.  ","When you have two sequences or functions, you are often interested in how fast they grow compared to one another. For example, suppose you have two functions f(n) and g(n) that tell you how many operations two different algorithms use to sort a list with n elements. As n gets bigger, if the number of operations f(n) gets bigger faster than the number of operations g(n) gets bigger, then you would say that g(n) is a more efficient algorithm. There are a variety of ways to make that idea more precise, and Big O/Omega/Theta are one of them. ""f(n) is Big O of g(n)"" means that the rate of growth of f(n) is at most the rate of growth of g(n). ""f(n) is Big Omega of g(n)"" means the rate of growth of f(n) is at least the rate of growth of g(n). ""f(n) is Big Theta of g(n)"" means f(n) and g(n) have the same rate of growth. /u/BigSerene is very close to correct, but I want to rephrase what they said an add some clarification. Buckle up, because this is knee-deep in college-level computer science. Big-Oh notation is used to compare algorithms and determine which ones take more time than others to complete. But what is an algorithm? Well, it's a finite series of steps to solve a problem. Very handy in computing. Some algorithms are really slow, though. Some are fast. We want to find the fast ones and avoid the slow ones (assuming both of them get the right answer in the first place). In order to do that, we need to have a standard to compare them by. That's Big-Oh. Say I want to find a pair of matching socks. Once thing I could do is, for every sock I own, compare it to every other sock I own (at a rate of one sock per minute, for simplicity) until I find a match. In the worst case, I'd need to go through every sock I own, _for every sock I own_, to find a match. Let's write it in Big-Oh. The notation is written relative to the size of your input. Usually this size is represented as _n_, and in this case, it represents the number of socks I own, which can vary over time. We want our algorithms to run reasonably well regardless of the size of the inputs. This one runs in O( n^2 ). One nice thing Big-Oh does for us is get rid of clutter. I'm going to avoid the actual definitions because this isn't /r/askscience, but the jist of it is that we can ignore any _constant-time processing_ that isn't related to how many socks we're looking through. Say I putzed around on my phone for an hour for no reason before I picked my socks. We could speed up by _not_ doing that, but it won't change or Big-Oh expression, because O( 60 + n^2 ) = O( n^2 ). Same story if I wanted to count up all my socks beforehand. O( n + n^2 ) = O( n^2 ). Or if I wanted to double-check something about each pair of socks I looked at. O( 2n^2 ) = O( n^2 ). It's really nifty and helps us compare algorithms without having to know the specifics of how the data is handled or preprocessed. Obviously the algorithms with the additional expressions will run a tad slower, but when you're processing a hundred million socks, those expressions are eclipsed (known as the asymptotic running time). These next few explanations are a distillation of the definitions, to keep things a little simpler. Unless you want to get in deeper, just take it at face value that constants are ignored, and that all members of an addition expression _except the one with the greatest magnitude_ are also ignored, a la O( 1000 + n + 1000n + n^2 ) = O( n^2 ). Big-Oh says that, _at worst_, the approximated running time of an algorithm (how long it will take me to find my matching pair of socks) will be _no higher than_ the approximation given in parentheses (in this case, n^2 ). Big-Omega is similar and says that, _at best_, the approximated running running time of an algorithm will be _no better than_ the approximation given in parentheses. For an algorithm to be Big-Theta( n^2 ), it has to be Big-Oh( n^2 ) _and_ Big-Omega( n^2 ). Those last two are mainly used in analysis, or to find the Big-Oh notation of algorithms that don't play quite as nicely as my socks example (say, algorithms that recurse). Hope that helps! I'd highly recommend reading the article ""A Gentle Introduction to Algorithm Complexity Analysis"". It really helped me understand the concepts and how to analyze the complexity of an algorithm, along with the notation.

Why are the heating vents placed over windows in homes and heaters over the entry doors in big stores? It seems like it would be inefficient as all that warmth gets lost to cold outside temperatures.,"The heat from the vent is not lost to the outside air. It is directed at the inside wall.

Window glass is the coldest part of a wall. When warm room air hits it, the air cools, and cool air sinks. The movement of cool air creates floor drafts that most people find uncomfortable. The placement of forced-air heat registers or baseboard heating units under the windows counteracts this process by sending up warm air to mix with the cool. The end result is that the room feels more comfortable. The reason is because the heat loss occurs mostly in the windows and the fenestration. The idea is that you would like the incoming air to be heated up. Also, it creates an air curtain that prevents more heat from being lost through these exposed areas. Finally, it makes the temperature of the room more or less uniform. If the heaters were placed at the center of the room, you would create a large temperature gradient, resulting in drafts and discomfort for the occupant. source: URL_1 URL_0 and that I have a minor in architecture It creates a kind of wall of hot air. If the window in open it obviously doesn't work as well but any air that hits the window and is cooled, when it comes back it gets warmed by the air in front of the window. It also prevents the imbalance if temperature u can get sometimes. Ever been able to feel the temperature difference when walking across a room, radiators by the window prevent that to an extent. Those blowers over the doors of stores and places like that, aren't heaters but just air blowers designed to create a kind of ""air barrier"" to prevent the hot/cold air from inside to scape outside In homes, heating vents and radiators are placed next to windows so that the rising hot air immediately moderates the cold air by the window. By convection, the now coolish-warm goes up, across the ceiling and then comes down on the other side of the room, from where it comes back to the window to repeat the cycle, driven by the convection currents. By this second and subsequent go-arounds, the room temperature is raised to a comfortable level all around. If the radiator had been placed away from the window, yes there will be a hot corner there but the convection currents then bring this warm air across the ceiling and then, already cooler, down the inside of the cold window. You now have a stream of cold air creeping back across the room, with the effect that in that far corner, you’d have an uncomfortable temperature gradient between the upper half and lower half of the room.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 56.56, 'recall': 15.0, 'fmeasure': 23.71}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.44, 'recall': 1.96, 'fmeasure': 3.1}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 38.52, 'recall': 10.22, 'fmeasure': 16.15}}"
Why do different engines require different viscosity lubricating oils?,"I'm not an engineer, but I can try to explain it in a way that makes sense to a non-engineer. Viscosity is a measure of how thick a fluid is. If you imagine a fluid as a liquid, then viscosity is how thick it is. If you imagine it as a gas, then viscosity is how thin it is. In the case of engine oil, viscosity is how thick it is. The reason different engines require different viscosities is because different engines work at different speeds. The faster the engine works, the thicker the oil has to be to keep it from getting too hot. This is why you'll see some engines use synthetic oil, which is made to be thicker than regular oil. It's because it has to be able to keep up with the higher speeds. The slower the engine works, the thinner the oil has to be to keep it from getting too cold. This is why you'll see some engines use synthetic oil, which is made to be thinner than regular oil. It's because it has to be able to keep up with the lower speeds. The engine works by burning fuel to generate heat, which makes the engine move. This heat is used to make the engine move, but it also heats up the engine.  ","Engine are built using ""tolerances"" between parts. those numbers simply means that they define a space between each moving components. Engine Oil is simply filling up the space between those parts to reduce the amount of friction. The wider the space , the more viscous oil will be required to keep things from rubbing too much. On the opposite, the tighter space will require a thinner oil to be able to seep thru. So when a engine is built , the maker will do some testing to see which oil viscosity is required to enable those hundreds of friction points to be lubricated and stay lubricated.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 19.91, 'recall': 43.27, 'fmeasure': 27.27}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.0, 'recall': 8.74, 'fmeasure': 5.49}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.27, 'recall': 28.85, 'fmeasure': 18.18}}"
why do we have an International Space Station but not an International Underwater Station?,"The International Space Station (ISS) was proposed in 1988 as a way to have a large-scale laboratory in space. The idea was that scientists from all over the world could work together on projects like studying the effects of microgravity on the human body, and the effects of space travel on the human body, and the effects of space travel on the human body. And the ISS was also a way to test out new technologies that would be used for manned missions to Mars and other planets. The ISS was built by Russia, the United States, Canada, Japan, and the European Union. The ISS is a very large spacecraft, and it is the largest spacecraft ever built. It is 450 feet long, and it has 16 modules, each one about the size of a school bus. The ISS is also very heavy, weighing about 450,000 pounds. The ISS is a very expensive project, and it has cost the United States over $100 billion to build and maintain. The ISS is also very complicated, and it has a lot of problems. It is hard to keep the ISS in orbit, because the Earth is constantly moving.

"Some of online programs are open source and have its source code on GitHub (for example bitwarden, a password manager). Doesn't knowledge of the source code allow hackers and user to break and abuse the program easier?"," [ URL_0 ]( URL_0 ) I'm just a software developer, so I'll give my opinion. I'm not an expert in this field, but I'll do my best. First, let's talk about what ""open source"" means. Open source is a software development model where the source code is made publicly available. Anyone can view, copy, modify, and redistribute the source code. This is in contrast to closed source software, where the source code is not publicly available. The source code is typically hosted on a public repository, like GitHub. This allows anyone to look at the code, and contribute to it. When we say ""anyone"", we mean anyone. It's not just a few people, it's anyone. If you know how to program, you can look at the code and contribute to it. This is one of the big advantages of open source software. Because anyone can contribute to it, it's much more likely that bugs will be fixed. This is because there are more people looking at the code. This is also why open source software is generally considered to be more secure. Because there are more people looking at the code, it's less likely that a vulnerability will go unnoticed. In addition, open source software is also less likely to have malicious code in it.  ","If knowing how your software is written lets me break your security then you have terrible security Security through obscurity is no security at all A well done security algorithm is still secure even if you know all the math behind it, having that open so that people can check it ensures that you have done the math right and haven't accidentally(or intentionally) introduced weaknesses into the security based off of how you implemented it. Not having the source code public doesn't stop hackers from analyzing it and finding weaknesses, they can still decompile it, but it does stop the public and researches from finding and patching weaknesses before they're exploited. And many others can look up the code to get rid of flaws and edges. Open source has the oportunity that the whole community can contribute to make these programs save and secure. Its balanced by the fact that since the code is public, anyone who wants can check the code and identify or fix any security flaws present. If you want to exploit a flaw in Open Source software, you either have to be the first one to find it or you need to be a lot smarter than the people developing and checking it. As a rule of thumb, if knowing how a program works poses a security risk, you don't want to be using that program because of the security risks. Programs aren't supposed to come with bunch of errors, security flaws and bugs. If you ship one anyway and just trust these flaws are hidden well enough, you're essentially just waiting until one of your employees turns into the dark side and sells these flaws, or someone just stumbles on them anyway and starts using them. You as a user then should ask yourself, if someone **doesn't** have their source code available to you, how secure can you be really? NSA actually had leaks some years back which revealed that they considered it a significant problem that they couldn't easily introduce flaws into open source programs that they could later use to attack users of those programs. With closed source, their opinion was that introducing these flaws was much easier. Well, it may... or it may not. Ideally, there should not be any security flaws at all, but in the real world bugs that can cause security holes are pretty much unavoidable. So it really all comes down to an arms race: who finds the flaw first, a responsible user or a malicious hacker? Whether the software is open source or closed source probably doesn't make a lot of difference to the arms race, in that it's going to be a race between the good guys and the bad guys one way or the other. Making it open source makes things easier for the bad guys, but it also makes things easier for the good guys. A problem with closed-source software is that some software companies are very reluctant to fix the flaws when they are found, instead preferring to deny that a problem even exists: with open-source software, if the flaw isn't fixed by the original creator, somebody else can fix it. A problem with open-source software is that you may not know whether the patch you're downloading for it comes from a reliable source: it's possible for a malicious user to release a patch which contains a deliberate security flaw, effectively making it a Trojan. Whether closed-source or open-source, the biggest issue is actually a reluctance by software administrators and private users to keep the software properly updated. There have been some massive security issues involving open-source software (the Equifax breach was one), but usually because somebody has seriously dropped the ball and the victim hasn't kept the software patched. The Wannacry virus was an example of a security flaw involving closed-source software. It affected outdated versions of Windows, which many companies and organisations were still using, but Microsoft had long since dropped support for it -- meaning that no patch for that particular flaw was issued for those platforms before it was exploited. In this case, though, it's not entirely the companies' fault: it is hugely expensive for a large company to switch to new (closed-source) operating systems every few years, something that often entails buying new hardware as well, and there's no guarantee that the software your company relies on won't break when the system is upgraded. Had the various versions of Windows been open-source, it's possible that somebody might have released patches for all of them before Wannacry became an issue. Basically, using open-source software is probably at least as safe as closed-source software, but you really do have to ensure that all your software is always properly patched and up to date otherwise you're going to be in trouble whatever kind of software you use. So there are some decent explanations but I think they are missing a bit. The big thing being that knowing the code does not allow a hacker to ""create"" a flaw. An exploit either exists or it doesn't. Hackers are attempting to find ways to do things that weren't intended. To keep this an ELI5 lets create a simple physical example. Let's say I buy gold for a living. In my shop I create a scale that converts the weight to a dollar value I will pay the customers. I have an attendant who will handle the transactions and he does only exactly what I tell him. In my instructions I tell him that he will take what the customer hands him, put it on the scale and pay the customer what the read out says. In creating my instructions I assume that because I only buy gold that customers will only give my attendant. I don't tell him not to weigh things that aren't gold. Well for a few months things go great until one day a customer hands my employee a rock instead and the attendant still weighs it and pays him. The flaw was always there but now it has been discovered. In an open source environment I would have posted the attendants instructions on the wall and someone might have pointed out the flaw to me before a malicious user found it.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 67.71, 'recall': 14.02, 'fmeasure': 23.23}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.92, 'recall': 3.9, 'fmeasure': 6.47}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.74, 'recall': 6.78, 'fmeasure': 11.23}}"

They didn't worry about profits; they believed the quality experts when they said that profit would come if they did things right. This drive to improve became ingrained in the culture of some of the auto companies. They started to see success in the market as a result, and that just reinforced the culture. They pursued various different techniques to drive continuous improvement, and some of them worked very well. American and German car companies have tried at times to replicate this, but they can never seem to muster the guts to commit totally and not worry about short-term profits. They have improved, but simply not as much. And some companies (I'm looking at you, Ford) have never been able to get past the idea that if you save $1 per car on a million cars, that's a million dollars of pure profit. They can't seem to internalize the inevitable degradation that happens with this thought process. The penny pinching is ingrained too deeply in their history and culture.

"Why is the current in a series circuit with multiple loads constant throughout the circuit? How do the electrons ""know"" to send less current in a circuit with more loads?"," I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question, but I’m hoping it is. I’m a 5th grader and I’m trying to understand the concept of current. I know that electrons flow through a circuit, but I don’t understand why it’s constant. I know that if you have multiple devices connected to a single power source, the current will be split up between the devices. But what happens when the devices are connected in a series circuit? Does the current flow in only one direction? I’m not sure what I’m missing here. I’m hoping someone can explain it to me. Thank you in advance.","The battery doesn't know anything, the amount of current is determined by the load If i put a 20 pound backpack on you and tell you to go for a run as fast as you can you'll make it in some certain speed If i put an 80 pound backpack on you and tell you to go for a run as fast as you can you'll be going much slower Would it be because you thought ""I am moving more load so i should run slower"" or because you aren't strong enough to move that larger load at the same speed(hint, its the second one) Same thing happens for the electrons. If you put more resistance in the circuit it is harder for them to squeeze around the circuit. Series devices all share the same current because an electron can't move forward without pushing another out of the way so you end up with the same number moving into the battery as out of the battery That last bit works like a straw. If i give you a big straw to blow down its not too challenging, there is some resistance. Now pinch the middle and try to blow, its a lot harder and you can't get as much air through even with more force, that's increased resistance. You're not choosing to get less work done because there is resistance, the resistance is causing you to get less work done > Since I'm thinking about this with the water analogy, I'm confused by how the battery ""knows"" that there's an extra load and it better send only half the current. Batteries don't send current. Batteries are a voltage source and (ideally) provide a fixed voltage regardless of the load. For the water analogy, how does a watter tower or pump station know to send more water to your garden hose when you swap the nozzle from the from the wide open high flow one to the narrow low flow one? It doesn't, it just provides a fixed pressure and whatever happens with flow happens. If you open a really really big valve, you will greatly increase flow and cause a pressure drop all the way along the pipe back to the source. The pressure wave travels at the speed of pressure waves, also known as sound. > Here's where I get confused: > If I hook up a 5V battery to a 1 Ohm resistor, I get 5A of current in my circuit. However, the moment I add another 1 Ohm resistor ""downstream"" of the first resistor, I get 2.5 A of current everywhere in the circuit, even ""upstream"" of the first resistor. It doesn't the moment you add a new resistor. He skipping what is known as the transient state and going to the next steady state. He's skipping the actual change process and telling you how it will end up. Let's say we swap a very very fast acting instantaneous switch that makes the resistance somewhere in the circuit higher. At that instant, the electrons in that new resistor, and that new resistor only, start to encounter more resistance and slow down. The rest of the circuit is unaffected. Next, the electrons before the new resistor start to catch up to the slowed down one. Current is higher upstream than it is down stream at this instance. They are like charges, so they repel each other. Them getting closer together is building up a voltage repelling then from getting any closer to each other. This creates a kind of back log, and will propogate backwards upstream all the way to the battery. On the downstream side, thanks to these slowed electrons, the ones ahead of then get further and further ahead. This gap of missing electrons (which are negative) is positively charged and wants to pull these electron back. This also propogates further downstream all the way to the battery. They'll be tugging back and forth and the current will fluctuate up and down all along the circuit as all things try to equalize. Current will not be equally everywhere, in places you will be building up or depleting charge to accomodate this. Eventually, this rippling in the current will settle down to zero and you will have a new steady current in your circuit, the one your teacher is telling you about that obeys KCL. How fast do these changes propogate at? Effectively the speed of light, that's why you can't notice them. The electrons attract and repel each other because they are electrically charged. Electrical chrages interact through voltages and electric field. Speed of light is just the speed a changing electric field propogates at in a vacuum. Inside of a wire is a little slower, but not far off. How long does this transient period last for? Probably millionth or billiotnths of the smallest time frame your brain can proceess. These aren't effects noticable to humans. It's really no different than a traffic jam in a highway. Just because one guy has to slam on the breaks to slow down for something doesn't mean the entire highway will instantly slow to his speed. There's a human reaction time and breaking time and this will propogate backwards as some speed until all the cars behind him slow down. Replace electrons with cars and human reaction time with the speed of light, and you have the circuit. Is your teacher wrong about KCL? No, KCL can be made to hold at all times. What he's skipping over is another two electrical circuit components, capacitors and inductors. Capacitors store charge and let through a displacement current, so all this minute charge build up and seperation would be represented by capacitors. Even if you don't have an actual physical capacitors in your circuit, you resistors and wires have inherent capacitance and inductance and to properly model it would have the actual physical resistor replaced with an ideal resistor and an ideal capacitor. Why did he skip capacitance and the actual change process when you add a new resistor? Because you'd need advanced mathematics including calculus and imaginary numbers to deal with it. In addition to being not all that important or even noticable. Also, as I've stated these changes happen way to fast for a human eye to see. However, if we stuck an actual capacitor in the circuit, a one that can hold a lot more charge than a resistor can, you could actually see these changes happening on a human timescale.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 68.97, 'recall': 7.2, 'fmeasure': 13.04}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.91, 'recall': 1.44, 'fmeasure': 2.61}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 36.21, 'recall': 3.78, 'fmeasure': 6.85}}"
How are tunnels that go underwater built?,"They're built in sections, each section is lowered into place by a crane. The sections are then joined together using steel reinforcement. There are two types of tunnels, one is made of concrete and the other is made of steel. Concrete tunnels are made of concrete and steel reinforcement. They are made in sections and are joined together by pouring concrete between them. Steel tunnels are made of steel and are made in sections. They are joined together by welding the sections together.","Under the water is some kind of ground. If you're lucky, that ground is sturdy clay or chalk that's easy to mine through by digging underground, and holds its shape long enough to quickly reinforce the tunnel with brick walls or with iron rings. If you're not lucky, that ground may be unstable silt, or really hard granite. In some situations, a river can be diverted through a temporary channel and the tunnel can be dug and covered over with a brick or concrete roof while the riverbed is dry. Sometimes you can do half the river at a time. For some crossings, it turned out to be easier not to tunnel at all, but just to put down big pipes at the bottom of the bay or river, hook those up at both ends to the approaches, and pump out the water. The most common way is to dig a trench on the surface below he water where you want the tunnel. Then you sink a bunch of large tubes in to the position you want them in the trench and bury the tubes in rocks so they dont move around. Finally you attach the tubes together and use pumps to drain the water. The Transbay Tunnel (Oakland to San Francisco, used by BART trains) was built by dropping in segments of the tube into the (soft, silty) bay floor, and then welding them together (using caissons) and pumping the water out. Pretty sure the tunnels from Norfolk to the Easter shore of Virginia were built in Louisiana and towed to their current location, sunk, sealed and pumped out. So, lots of different ways. A bit late, but I wanted to add: For larger tunnels for trains and such (the Chunnel) the process is usually digging below determined thickness of rock that can support the weight of the overlaying water. Sometimes the sediment is enough if it is a clay or silt but I think it’s usually preferred to go through bedrock/heavily reinforce the tunnels. For smaller tunnels like cables or pipelines there is a process called horizontal directional drilling, or hdd for short. Here’s a [video]( URL_0 ) with the basic idea. Sometimes the tunnel is over-pressurized with air to stop the water from seeping in until the walls are properly waterproofed. A cool documentary on a tunnel here in Vancouver built in the 50s. Assembled, sunk and drained URL_0 You place a full tunnel of blocks of your choice then hollow it out to eliminate the water 👌🏼","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.43, 'recall': 9.11, 'fmeasure': 15.23}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.61, 'recall': 0.7, 'fmeasure': 1.18}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.19, 'recall': 5.14, 'fmeasure': 8.59}}"
Why Do Wind Turbines Always Have 3 Blades?,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""long answer"". The short answer is that wind turbines have three blades because it's the most efficient way to harness the wind. Wind turbines work by spinning a shaft that is connected to a generator. The shaft is connected to the blades by a gearbox. The blades are designed to be as long as possible while still being able to rotate in the wind. The longer the blades, the more wind they can capture. The gearbox is designed to reduce the speed of the wind to a speed that the generator can handle. The generator is the device that converts the mechanical energy of the wind turbine into electrical energy. It's the most efficient way to harness the wind because it's the most efficient way to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. The gearbox and generator are connected to a tower that is tall enough to reach the wind. The tower is designed to be strong enough to support the weight of the gearbox, generator, blades, and the wind turbine. The blades are attached to the shaft by a bearing. The bearing is designed to reduce friction so the blades can spin smoothly. The blades are made of a special type of plastic called fiberglass. Fiberglass is lightweight and strong.  ","I just learned this in class last week. The number of blades chosen is a function of the tip speed ratio, which is the velocity of the tip of the blade over the velocity of the wind. If you have a high tip speed ratio, you have a low number of blades. Tip speed ratio is actually chosen for design purposes to be usually about 5 to 7 (i didn't copy the graph down in lecture), and the chart says to use 3 for that range. Basically I guess it's because it's cheapest to produce and transport blades of that length versus how much power you'll get out of the turbine Adding more propellors increases weight and turbulence, and can actually make a wind turbine less efficient. Also, the object isn't to catch the most wind, it is to keep the turbine spinning within it optimal range. For a given amount of propellor length, fewer blades are usually better. One blade is obviously impractical because the propeller would be unbalanced. The jump from two to three doesn't lose a lot of efficiency, but it does save a lot of space, allow more shorter towers. More than three doesn't give you as good of a tradoff. Three blades is calculated to be the right number to catch the wind but also not too many such that they run into the turbulence of the last blade that passed through that space. Too many blades and they block air rather than catch it.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 42.08, 'recall': 36.19, 'fmeasure': 38.91}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.18, 'recall': 7.03, 'fmeasure': 7.56}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.81, 'recall': 17.9, 'fmeasure': 19.25}}"
why did municipalities use lead pipes for water in the first place? At what point was that a good idea?,"Lead pipes were used because they were cheap. They were made of lead, which was abundant and cheap at the time. They were also lightweight, easy to transport, and easy to bend into various shapes. They were also considered to be durable, as they were able to withstand the wear and tear of moving water. The downside of lead pipes was that they were also very poisonous, which made them a serious health risk for people living in cities. In the 1920s, scientists discovered that lead was a major factor in the development of mental retardation, and cities began to replace their lead pipes with copper pipes. By the 1950s, lead pipes were no longer used.","Lead is easy to form, very stable, and cheap. Especially if we are talking about 100+ year old technology, it is just one of the easiest and chepaest way to make a pipe. If lead was safe, it would probably still be used today in a lot more applications. And 100+ years ago the dangers of lead were not understood like they are today. Lead pipes were used in ancient Rome, because lead is an abundant metal that's easy to form into things. No cities in the last couple of centuries used lead pipe, but they used lead in solder to fit their copper pipes. It is a fine idea because the lead corrodes quickly to build up a protective coating and after that it's remarkable stable and safe. Things only go bad, like in Flint MI, when the people operating the water supply make mistakes. Mistakes can cause the protective lead oxide to be removed and much more lead to be leached into the water supply. The Flint folks made a mistake because they wanted to save money. Lead forms a small layer of corrosion when water flows through it. Protecting the user from the effects of lead poisoning. This is why it’s no longer allowed to be worked on (where I live) and is usually replaced. It can never be soldered. Source: I’m a plumber Lead pipes are actually much safer than people think and many houses still have them, though it's much safer to replace them I you have kids especially. By keeping the pH high in water lead is highly insoluble and in the case of high traffic plumbing the water tends not to have the time nor the agitation to dissolve the lead very readily. It's the equivalent of just pouring salt in water. It would take quite a long time to dissolve completely with no agitation, despite a high solubility. These two facts generally mean that lead piping can be used with few measurable side effects in humans. TL;DR-Though it's not great, there was little health incentive to do so because very little lead actually leeches into the water.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 56.9, 'recall': 18.13, 'fmeasure': 27.5}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.39, 'recall': 5.51, 'fmeasure': 8.37}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.31, 'recall': 9.34, 'fmeasure': 14.17}}"
How do hand brakes work on automobiles? Do they use the same mechanism as normal brakes?,"Hand brakes are used to slow a vehicle down when the regular brakes fail. The hand brake is not a regular brake but rather a secondary brake. The regular brake system is connected to the wheels, and when you press the pedal, the wheels are slowed down. The hand brake is connected to the transmission. When you press the pedal, the transmission slows down, and the wheels are slowed down.","They typically operate the rear brakes mechanically as opposed to hydraulically. This is why they have been and continue to be called ""emergency brakes"" by some people, in theory they should still engage the rear brakes without brake pressure. There is an actual cable going to the rear brakes as well as a brake line full of brake fluid. This varies vehicle to vehicle of course. Hand brake was a cable that you pull to apply mechanical pressure on the pads. Now a lot of vehicles have it on a push button because most people never use it for a decade, it rusts. Then use it and it becomes jammed. Electronic e brake is the same principle except there is a motor that will work when you push the botton and it will activate itself at time while you are in park. Your normal brakes are hydraulic powered. You press on a piston that pushes fluid in all the system. They got a few different ways of doing it, but it is two separate systems, even when parts are shared. You used to have a single channel master cylinder feeding all your brakes with proportioning valves used to set brake bias. This system was designed for a drum brake system with two seals in every wheel cylinder, for a total of eight, plus at least 3 rubber hoses (could be four or five) as a point of failure for the entire hydraulic brake system. The emergency brake was for when one of those points failed (cause surprise! People back then didn't take care of their shit either). It was a mechanical system used as a back up by operating only the rear brakes because they want you to be able to steer after you lock em up (Subaru WTF? Or was that the hill hold brake? Still WTF Subaru?). Someone who's brakes were held together with rust failed and could stop their car, now we're blessed with the parking brake. We also have a split system master cylinder that only controls half the brakes, either both front/both back or left front right rear/right front left rear. Now only half your brakes fail at once due to a hydraulic failure. A few different systems came around after 4 wheel disc brakes. My favorites are the hat on drum or the separate mini caliper styles. You still should use them regularly, but you're not fucking up the calipers by not using them (thanks Ford). The other kind is built into the caliper. It uses a ratchet and lever to apply the brake and self adjust. It's perfect on paper. The problem is when you don't use it, all the nasty stuff in your brake fluid settles on the bottom and when you finally do use it, it's not only way out of adjustment, but it's now scoring the surfaces with brake fluid gunk (cause why would you bleed the brakes? They work a don't they...).

Why do tires “go off” or get slower over the course of the race?," “The rubber compound in the tires wears out and the tire becomes less grippy, leading to slower lap times.” - URL_0 I’m not sure if this is the right answer but I have a theory. There are two types of rubber in tires. One is the rubber that makes the tread pattern and the other is the rubber that holds the tread pattern in place. The rubber that holds the tread pattern is called “tread reinforcement” and it’s the same stuff that holds the tread pattern in place. The tread rubber gets worn down as you drive and the tread reinforcement is what makes the tire hold its shape. The tread rubber is what actually grips the road. The tread reinforcement is what keeps the tread from coming off. As the tread rubber wears down, the tread reinforcement also wears down. This causes the tread rubber to lose its grip on the road and the tire becomes less grippy. This is why your tires get slower over the course of the race. The rubber compound in the tire wears out and the tire becomes less grippy, leading to slower lap times.","New tires have smooth, consistent contact patches. As the race goes on, the tire is subject to extreme asymmetrical loads. This changes the contact patch shape and wears different areas of the tire more quickly. The tire also sees abrasion from the track surface or debris, and if the rubber exceeds ideal temperature the tire can bluster, which causes vibration and additional wear. Therefore, all of these causes lead to a significantly altered contact patch and increased wear. This hurts lap times. Race tires are made of somewhat uncured rubber and are VERY soft and sticky rubber, great for the best possible grip while racing. But that also means they have an extremely short life. The both wear out very quickly because they are such soft rubber against an abrasive surface and once they fully heat up the rubber itself starts to cure. One heat cycle and they are no longer fully soft, they have begun to cure to a harder rubber with far less traction.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 29.53, 'recall': 34.34, 'fmeasure': 31.75}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.73, 'recall': 6.67, 'fmeasure': 6.16}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.99, 'recall': 16.27, 'fmeasure': 15.04}}"
"Why did the boats used by American’s on D-Day have a front hatch? Why didn’t they use side/ back hatches and use the front as cover, instead of running head first into machine gun fire?"," D-Day was the day when the Allies invaded the beaches of Normandy in order to gain a foothold in Nazi occupied Europe. The invasion involved thousands of ships, landing craft, and smaller boats, all of which were heavily armed with machine guns and other weapons. The invasion was a risky and dangerous operation, and the boats were designed to provide cover for the soldiers as they landed on the beach. The front hatches were designed to allow the soldiers to get in and out of the boats quickly and easily, and the sides and back were covered with armor plating to protect the soldiers from machine gun fire. The front hatches were not large enough for the soldiers to get in and out of the boats while the boats were moving, so the soldiers had to jump into the water and swim to the boats. The front hatches were not used for this purpose, as it was too risky and the soldiers would have been exposed to machine gun fire. The boats were designed to be as stealthy as possible, so they did not have large hatches that would make them more visible to the enemy. The side and back hatches were not used because they were not designed to be used in this way. The boats were designed to be used as small landing craft, and they were not designed to be used as stealthy assault boats.  ","Doors on the front let you unload into shallower water, ideally straight onto the beach. Remember these guys were carrying a lot of weight, if they got into water over their head they were going to drown, there was no way to swim and many soldiers did drown after going over the sides or leaving boats that couldn't get close enough Unloading from the rear is no good, you don't want people getting into the propeller as that might damage the boat and block a section of the beach If you're landing thousands of soldiers on a beach you're going to have heavy casualties. The best way to reduce them is to end the battle quickly, the best way to do that is getting as many men on the beach as fast as possible.

It's not a big deal, and it doesn't change the airplane's performance. It's a design choice, not a safety requirement. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is to reduce the drag on the vertical stabilizer. By making it slightly angled, it reduces the drag on the stabilizer, which helps to reduce fuel consumption and increase the aircraft's range. The second reason is to make it easier for the pilot to control the aircraft in certain maneuvers.

Why is there one standard for music and movie playback that multiple manufacturers use but not for video games.,The answer is that the video game industry is very fragmented and not a single company can dictate a standard. There are many different types of games and the platforms that run them are also very diverse. It is also a very competitive industry and the companies that make them don't want to be limited by what a single company says. They are very protective of their intellectual property and don't want to be forced to make their games compatible with anything else. It is also very expensive to make games and it is much easier for them to just make their own hardware and software. They are also very concerned about piracy and don't want to make it too easy for people to copy their games.,"Actually they do. Both PS4 games and Xbox One games use Blu-Ray discs. The reason why you can't play a game for one console on the other however is twofold. First, the encoding done on the disks at the time they're burned which includes code that prevents ""unapproved"" disks from being used. This is why you can't just download a ripped version of a next-gen game and burn it to a blu-ray, then stick it in your console. Second, each console has a very strict list of hardware that is used to create the console. This line has gotten blurrier in recent years as consoles have gotten closer and closer to being basically just PCs with specifically tailored operating systems but the hardware limitations still exist. If you were to put a disc from one system into the other and it *were* capable of reading it, the code on the disc still wouldn't necessarily be compatible with the hardware in use by the system. To use a highly generalized example the code on the disc may be expecting a specific graphics processor that isn't used on a competing console. tl;dr - Code on the disk is tailored to the console it's used for, both for antipiracy measures and in order to get as much power as possible from the machine. The fact that this forces consumers to use a specific console for specific games is just a bonus as far as the console manufacturers are concerned.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.85, 'recall': 22.35, 'fmeasure': 29.61}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.1, 'recall': 1.57, 'fmeasure': 2.09}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.54, 'recall': 10.98, 'fmeasure': 14.55}}"

"Why do Large Planes Require Horizontal and Vertical Separation to Avoid Vortices, But Military Planes Fly Closely Together With No Issue?","հեղինակ:

So, in the US, the FAA requires a minimum of 1,000 feet of horizontal separation and 500 feet of vertical separation between aircraft. This is because the engines on commercial aircraft are large and produce a lot of thrust, which creates a large amount of lift, and this lift is what creates the vortex. The vortex is the spinning air that forms behind the aircraft, and it can be dangerous to other aircraft. The military has a different set of rules, and they do not require the same level of separation. This is because the military aircraft are smaller and don’t produce as much thrust, so they don’t create as much lift, and therefore don’t create as much of a vortex. The military aircraft are also typically designed to be more maneuverable, so they can fly closer together. The military aircraft also don’t have to deal with the same level of commercial traffic, so they don’t have to worry about a large number of other aircraft flying close to them. The commercial aircraft also have to deal with air traffic control, and they have to follow strict rules and procedures. The military aircraft don’t have to deal with air traffic control, so they don’t have to follow the same rules and procedures.","Military pilots are securely attached to the plane and willing to tolerate much more extreme maneuvers than commercial passengers. To reduce the ""fear of flying"" and avoid spilling drinks, commercial aircraft desire a much more stable ride. It's like watching a race car go down a track at 300 kilometres an hour, compared to a bus full of 50 people doing forty on a city street. If a bus went 300 down the street with another bus a half-second behind it, I don't think any of the passengers would be getting on that bus ever again. We’re much, much more aware of where those vortices are, and can adjust our position to avoid them. Also, separation between aircraft is also for safety during abrupt, unexpected maneuvers, not just for vortices. I’m talking directly to the other aircraft in my flight so I’m aware of when abrupt turns will happen.. if I’m in front, I know the position of the other aircraft to be able to avoid turning in a way that endangers them. Commercial aircraft don’t have a lot of direct communication with other aircraft without preplanning frequencies. Aerodynamic factors of vortices can be avoided by flying in proper formation (either with step up or step down, depending on the situation (step up being vertical separation from cockpit to cockpit)). Military aircraft (including helicopters) fly tight formation to decently sized aircraft (C-130s, KC-10s, etc) all the time during in flight refueling and that's generally not too problematic (as long as it isn't too turbulent). Legally, it's because the FAA requires something like... I think at least ~~1~~ 3 miles laterally and 1000 feet in altitude (I should know this) between each aircraft on an instrument clearance (which pretty much all commercial flights have). Military aircraft can declare MARSA which is ""Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft."" This relieves ATC of the 1 mile/1000 feet separation requirement and so the military pilots are now flying formation off the lead aircraft. Edit: After some google-fu, it looks like lateral separation is 3 miles in a terminal environment and 5 miles en route, with (generally) 1000 feet of vertical separation. Source: FAA order 7110.65, 4-5-1 and 5-5-4. I'm not an expert, but from what I've observed, the military planes like the Blue Angels fly side by side, so all the vortices are behind them. Second, the military pilots are trained to deal with an injured/damaged/partially disabled aircraft so their skills might be more oriented in that direction. Plus the plane they are flying is much more maneuverable than a jumbo jet. Third, commercial airlines want to avoid vortices because they cause bumpy rides, and then passengers complain. Plus the horizontal and vertical separation just makes more sense from a safety standpoint also. Normal aircraft separation under Instrument Flight Rules is defined in FAA Order 7110.65. Either 1000 feet vertical or 3 miles lateral separation (more if dealing with Heavy aircraft and aircraft on final approach if different weight classes). You can have less than this if flying under Visual Flight Rules (see and avoid). Military aircraft flying in formation use a rule called MARSA - Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft - in which they fly under one flight plan as essentially one aircraft for purposes of ATC. Military planes doing exercises in restricted airspace are flying under VFR, and are responsible for their own separation. Source: former military and civilian RAPCON/TRACON controller. EDIT: pointed out by another user that MARSA is Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft. I accidentally a word. Been out of the aviation industry for about 7 years. Wake turbulence is a by product of the lift being produced by the wing. The heavier the plane, the more lift that needs to be generated, therefore the wake turbulence will be greater. An aircraft will produce the most wake turbulence while flying at a heavy weight, at a slow speed and in a ""clean"" configuration (no flaps, or minimal flap settings). Once the aircraft is accelerated in cruise flight for example, the wake turbulence is still there but it is dramatically reduced. Military aircraft flyijg in tight formation are usually in this cruise phase of flight. We have seen a couple high profile wake turbulence upsets at cruise altitudes recently, the Challenger 604 vs the A380 over the Middle East had garnered a lot of attention from the industry because it highlights the risk of wake turbulence upsets outside the terminal area. In the arrival phase, ATC provides anywhere between 3-6 miles of lateral separation. Certain pilot techniques can be applied while landing to avoid wake turbulence but it is invisible so there is only so much you can do. While flying an approach behind a 767 or 747 used to keep me on my toes, now I'm also worried about the wake turbulence more and more at altitude. I will be crossing the Atlantic at 40,000 or 41,000 feet which usually puts you above most large airliners exceptttttt now the 787 Dreamliner can be found anywhere between 40,000 -43,000 ft. It's a lot harder to shit post on Reddit at 40W when you have to worry about Dreamliner McDreamliner face coming opposite direction 1000 ft above you. Air traffic controller here, this won't exactly be ELI5, but I'll do my best. The way this question is being asked is actually confusing two separate things that we have procedures for in ATC. The vertical and horizontal separation that we use doesnt have anything to do with wake turbulence, it has everything to do with not letting the aircraft physically collide with each other. If we allow two IFR aircraft to get closer than that without ever establishing visual separation, then we get in major trouble. Wake turbulence is not to be confused with Jet Blast or prop wash. Wake turbulence is a horizonal vortex emanating from the wingtips that starts as soon as the aircraft's nose lifts off the run way and stops when the aircraft touches down for a landing. The vortex can persist for several minutes, descends slowly at about 300ft per minute. In still air, the vortices will move away from the aircraft as they descend in opposite directions, but a crosswind can cause one of the vortexes to stall over the runway. This is where the danger lies. If a small aircraft flew into a strong vortex created by a large heavy aircraft, it can cause the entire aircraft to rotate along the axis that runs from nose to tail, flipping it upside down and causing an unrecoverable crash. We do protect for wake turbulence, but not by using the 3 miles horizontal or 1,000ft vertical rules. We restrict the distance that aircraft can follow behind another aircraft as they are coming in to land on the same runway. The larger the aircraft in front is, the larger the distance we put between them. We also restrict aircraft from taking off behind a departing aircraft by a certain time interval, the heavier the aircraft in front, the more time we wait before authorizing a takeoff. Once the appropriate time interval has passed, the vorticies will have had enough time to dissapate and will no longer be a factor. BTW, this can be confusing, the terms, small, large, heavy, and super that we use dont refer to the SPECIFIC weight of the aircraft at that time, those aircraft fall into their respective catergories regardless of how much they are carrying. A fully loaded C130 will still just be a large, a completely empty C17 will always be a Heavy, etc etc. Further more, when talking about ""military aircraft flying closer together"", its important to distinguish between things like refueling operations, standard/nonstandard formation flights, and aerobatic airshow type blue angles formations. For things like refueling operations, wake turbulence absolutley is a factor and the aircraft flying behind to get the fuel have to take it into account as they approach the tanker. When the only aircraft involved are fighter type aircraft like F18s, wake turbulence isn't strong enough to really have a noticible effect on the aircraft trailing in the formation. As for the blue angles, those guys are just plane nuts. I've done formation training in military planes. There's several factors at play here that allow us to fly several Feet away from each other: 1. We've briefed with the crew in the other plane. We know them and have established a general plan for how the flight will go, and what manuevers we will do. 2. We use standardized hand signals to tell the other crew what we're doing, and look for the standard reply that they've acknowledged our signals. 3. We have a discrete radio frequency that only the two of us (or however many are in formation) are using. The primary method to pass info is hand signals, but we have the radios as backup. 4. We're trained in how to avoid prop/jet wash, and how to recover from it safely without hitting another plane in the event that we do encounter it. 5. We maintain proper positioning. It sounds crazy, but when you're flying in formation, the closer you are the safer it is. If I'm flying wing, and I'm tucked up close in parade position, I can detect if anything is wrong sooner and easier than if I'm farther away in trail or chase position. 6. Lastly, if anything goes wrong, we've briefed and thuroughly discussed just about every contingency plan. We know what we need to do and what the other plane will do if we lose sight of each other, lose radio contact, fly in to the clouds, have an engine failure, run in to each other, etc. We spend hours talking about this before each flight. Of course if things get too bad (like we ran in to each other and lost a wing) there's always the option of pulling the ejection handle. Obviously it's not the first choice, or the second, or the third, but it's there. Airliners that are flying at altitude, and being routed on instrument flight plans have none of this. 1. Theres no reason for flying closer than they already are. 2. They're less manuverable. 3. They likely have zero training in formation flight 4. They've probably never met each other before, and certainly didn't discuss flying formation before they took off. It's an FAA requirement that any aircraft that will fly formation with each other have prior knowledge before takeoff. The larger and heavier an aircraft is the more severe the wingtip vortices and turbulence are from the disturbance of the air moving over the aircraft's surface. Military aircraft (fighters and attack) are heavy and big, but not on the scale of a 747 or A380. Those aircraft are literally hundreds of times heavier and larger, and produce stronger and larger effects behind them. In addition to comfort mentioned by someone else, large transport aircraft are not very maneuverable compared to military aircraft and would struggle to recover from the effects of other aircrafts wake. You know how people like to say routine flying is safer than driving? Not the case in the military. Even at peacetime. Most of the required horizontal and vertical separation rules are for collision avoidance more so than turbulence avoidance. Also, the military aircraft flying in formation (for example) are not flying in each other's wake turbulence even though it might appear that way. Military planes don’t always fly together without issue. Allow me introduce you to the tragedy of my favorite plane, the [XB-70 Valkyrie Mach 3 Strategic Bomber]( URL_1 ). According to [Wikipedia]( URL_0 ): *The accident investigation also pointed to the wake vortex off the XB-70's right wingtip as the reason for the F-104's sudden roll over and into the bomber.* This was the cause of a famous mid-air collision between the XB-70 experimental bomber and one of the chase planes. URL_0 You do not really see them close, and ot the aft of AF1 for example, mostly I believe it is the size of the plane. That is why commercial airports hate GA light aircraft, I think you have wait 3 minutes after a heavy takes off to completely screws up the timing.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 83.18, 'recall': 8.67, 'fmeasure': 15.71}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 27.85, 'recall': 2.89, 'fmeasure': 5.24}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 43.64, 'recall': 4.55, 'fmeasure': 8.24}}"
I don't understand how it is possible to cool a car engine with air alone. So how does air-cooled engines work?,"The radiator is a heat exchanger, it allows the air to flow through it, which causes the air to lose heat to the radiator, which is then cooled by the fan. The air is forced through the radiator and then through the engine. This allows the engine to cool down, and the fan then blows the air through the radiator again, and the process starts again. This is why air-cooled engines are called ""air-cooled"" - the air is being used to cool the engine. In a water-cooled engine, the water is being used to cool the engine. In a liquid-cooled engine, the liquid is being used to cool the engine.","There is a lot of air, and the average temperature of the air is suitable for long-term engine operation. It's simply a matter of exchanging the engine heat with enough air. Even liquid cooled engines do this, they use a fluid to move the heat to a radiator and from there into the air. An air cooled engine simply does it directly. It uses fans to circulate a lot of air over an engine structure with fins to provide enough surface area to exchange the heat. The main difference you'd see on air cooled engines are [fins]( URL_2 ). [Lots]( URL_0 ) and [lots]( URL_1 ) of fins. What these do is increase the effective surface area of the engine by a *lot*. This is all surface area that's going to heat up when the engine gets hot, and so air going over those fins will far more effectively be able to pull heat away than if the engines were smooth and finless. On a motorcycle, they just rely on the forward motion of the bike to send air over those fins and keep the air cool. In cars (like the old VW Beetle) there are ducts and fans that send air over those fins to pull heat away. The problem is it's not as controllable. With liquid cooling you pull the heat away from the engine in a medium, in the usual case engine coolant, and then the heat is dumped into a radiator, which can be easily cooled either by movement of the car itself, or with a dedicated cooling fan. Plus water has far more capacity for heat than air. Air cooling once you get beyond a certain point (power level, heat output) stops being effective, which is where liquid cooling comes in. All engines are cooled with air. Engines with liquid radiators just take the heat from the engine into a liquid then into the air via a radiator. Air cooled engines just invite that air to blow directly over the metal of the engine. To increase the ability of the (air) fluid to remove heat from the lump of metal, the engine's metal will be finned to create increased surface area for the air to blow over and absorb heat from. Also, something I think people don't think about: the car engine will still be really, really hot. It will just be 'cool' enough to not overheat. So yes, the air is 'cooling' the engine--the engine is 'cooler' than it would be otherwise. But you hear 'cool' and think ""cool to the touch"". That's not happening, same as with water-cooled engines.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 76.11, 'recall': 19.28, 'fmeasure': 30.77}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 31.25, 'recall': 7.87, 'fmeasure': 12.57}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 46.9, 'recall': 11.88, 'fmeasure': 18.96}}"
How can Tesla's new truck have a lower drag coefficient than a Bugatti Chiron when the surface area is so much larger?,"   vehicle is determined by the air resistance of the vehicle. This is determined by the shape of the vehicle. The more streamlined a vehicle is, the less air resistance it will have, and the lower its drag coefficient will be.   vehicle is determined by the drag area, which is the area of the vehicle that is exposed to the air flowing around it, and the drag coefficient itself, which is a dimensionless quantity that is a measure of the drag area.   vehicle is determined by the drag area, and the drag coefficient itself. The drag area is determined by the shape of the vehicle, and the drag coefficient is determined by the drag area.   vehicle is a measure of how much drag the vehicle has.

The lower the drag coefficient, the less drag the vehicle has, and the more efficient it is.  ","There is a difference between ""drag"" and ""drag coefficient"". The equations to calculate the drag coefficient account for the surface area. If you have two spheres, where one is 1 inch in diameter and one is 1 foot in diameter, they will both have the same drag coefficient, but the bigger sphere will have more drag. Coefficients are normalized to remove such things as size and surface area, which aren't important to a coefficient. The number represents how streamlined a particular aerodynamic object is. An airplane can have a very low drag coefficient while experiencing substantially more drag simply because it's either bigger or moving faster. Many performant cars actually have really high coefficients because they have air inlets for intake and cooling, as well as aerodynamics that provide downforce at the expense of drag. The [Aerocivic]( URL_0 ) is a 1987 Honda Civic covered in a sheet metal shroud salvaged from a disused shed that has a really low drag coefficient though it's not really all that fast, and it has far more weight and surface area than the original car. It's drag is so low it leaves a minimal wake, so drafting this car (following closely behind it so your car has to displace less air) is pointless. It's not just the surface area that you have to account for. A large amount of air is actually captured into the Chiron to use to cool the engine. This is what is creating most of the drag, not just the surface area.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 38.74, 'recall': 33.33, 'fmeasure': 35.83}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.14, 'recall': 7.0, 'fmeasure': 7.53}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 22.97, 'recall': 19.77, 'fmeasure': 21.25}}"

How do plastic tyre bikes work? Why did we use rubber ones (requiring air to be pumped in) in the first place?,"The first bicycles were made of wood and iron, but they were heavy and hard to ride. In the 1870s, a man named John Kemp Starley invented a bike with a rubber tire. This was a big improvement, because rubber was lighter and softer than iron, and it was easier to pedal. Rubber tires also made the bikes quieter. But the rubber tires had a problem: they were hard to pump up. You had to use a hand pump to fill them with air, and you had to do it every day. This was a hassle, and it made the bikes more expensive. So in the 1970s, a man named Norman Hendee invented a bike with a plastic tire. The plastic tire was lighter and easier to pump up than rubber, and it was cheaper too. This made the bikes more affordable, and they became very popular. Today, most bikes have plastic tires. They are easy to pump up, and they are cheap. But plastic tires are not as good as rubber tires. They don't last as long, and they don't grip the road as well.  ","Well, the material itself is somewhat stiffer, while still retaining a certain flexibility. The holes are there to offer room for the material to flex, avoiding the uncomfortable hardness you'd experience if the tires were solid- it fulfills the same purpose as the pressurized air inside a regular tire, as well as lowering weight. The classical, inflatable tires fulfill the requirements to enjoy a smooth ride, while remaining simple to produce, but early on, bike tires were, in fact, solid rubber.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 18.62, 'recall': 42.68, 'fmeasure': 25.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.53, 'recall': 1.23, 'fmeasure': 0.75}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 10.11, 'recall': 23.17, 'fmeasure': 14.07}}"
why do tires have to have air? Why can’t they just be solid rubber?,"n/a I'm not sure, but I think it's because the tire is a lot more flexible and durable with air in it.

The tire is a bit like a balloon, and air is what keeps it from popping. The rubber in the tire is very strong and flexible, but it can only stretch so far. If you fill a tire with air, the rubber can stretch further, making the tire stronger and more flexible. Without air, the rubber would be very hard and stiff, which would make the tire more prone to cracking.","Tires absorb impact, they work with the suspension to make for a smooth ride.

Why do guns that fire the same caliber of bullet have different muzzle velocities?," Lets say you have two guns, one that fires a .223 caliber bullet and another that fires a .308 caliber bullet. Why do these two guns have different muzzle velocities? The answer lies in the difference in the length of the barrel. The longer barrel of the .308 caliber gun gives the bullet more time to expand and gain velocity, resulting in a higher muzzle velocity.","Bullets are accelerated by the expanding hot gasses behind the bullet. If your barrel is 3 inches long, the bullet leaves the barrel before all the gas is finished pushing on the bullet. If your barrel is 5 feet long, the gas pushes all it can and then the bullet slows down due to friction in the barrel. Somewhere in the middle is the perfect point where the expanding gas gives the bullet all the energy it can with the least energy lost to friction. The M16 has a longer barrel, giving the bullet more speed when it exits the barrel.

How is it that an intermittent drip from a faucet can keep the entire pipe system from freezing ?,"When the faucet is turned off, the pressure is released from the pipe system.

If you open the can beforehand, there’s more room for the soda to expand out the opening, the rest of the can will stay intact. Opening a faucet, even a little, makes more room for the water inside your pipes. So if any of that water does freeze and expand, instead of pushing on the pipe, that expansion pushes more water out of the faucet. Imagine a house with pipes and those pipes are full of water and it's a closed system - all the valves are closed. If the water freezes in one portion, water expands as it freezes pushing the water in the rest of the system.

This is why you are not supposed to climb the top step. It's safer to climb the ladder with your feet on the bottom step, and your hands on the top step. If you do this, you can use your hands to support your weight and keep yourself safe. If you climb the ladder with your feet on the top step, your hands will not be able to support your weight.

The extra steps on top of a ladder, that you aren’t supposed to climb are there for structural integrity and stability. This is so the climber doesn’t fall.

How do mines handle snow? Like several meters. Aren't they pressure sensitive and wouldn't the added pressure just blow up the mine?,Most mines are built with the assumption that there will be snow on the roof. They have a ventilation system to keep the air circulating and prevent snow from building up. The ventilation system is designed to be very powerful and to be able to handle the weight of snow.,"It depends completely on the design of the mine. The simplest mine you can imagine just has a trigger weight. 20 pounds say. Your question then becomes ""If I put 20 pounds of snow on top of that will it go off?"" Yes it will. If you ask ""if i put 15 pounds of snow on it then a person walks over will it go off?"" the answer is again yes even if a footstep is distributed down to only 5 pounds on the mine. If your question is ""is there some amount of snow that will spread out enough weight of the person not to set off the mine?"" The answer is completely dependent on the trigger weight of the mine. Now... that said. I think on the DMZ the kind of mine you need to use is a bit more sophisticated. I know nothing about mines but I do know that in korea in the winter the ground can freeze. When things freeze, they squeeze. Thus, to avoid being set off I imagine a landmine need to measure the rate of change of weight on it as opposed to the actual weight on it. And that would really help avoid going off in the event you were walking over it when it was covered by a very thick layer of snow. Even a few meters of snow isn't heavy enough to trigger most landmines. Though mine fields due tend to suffer attrition over time due to things like bad weather, landslides, fires, etc. and need to be constantly maintained. The mines are designed for the pressure of a human foot stepping on them, or a tank rolling over them, depending on the type of mine. For the same reason, APOPO's rats (a Reddit favorite topic a few years ago) don't set off landmines when they go scurrying over terrain trying to sniff out mine locations. URL_0 it all comes down to the type of fuse and/or the mine itself. if its a [tiltrod trigger]( URL_3 ) than yes, snow could potentially set it off by shifting it more than 20 degrees out of center. if its a [tripwire]( URL_1 ) attached to an M16A2 or ""Bouncing Betty"" the snow will pile up and just cover the wire and it wouldn't build up enough weight to set it off. its its the typical [pressure fuse]( URL_2 ) on an M15 then the snow would have to build up enough weight directly on the pressure plate, added bonus some of the early fuses used a liquid filled ampule akin to a chemlight...and it would freeze. The new fused need something like 300lbs to go off. As far as walking over snow...if the snow was thick enough and displaced enough of your weight, then yes it ""Could"" be safe. Cold isn't great for mines but it doesn't stop them. Mines are very dangerous but also oddly specific in the triggering. If a [toe popper]( URL_0 ) goes off under 4 meters of snow you would probably barely hear it. Snow is not very heavy and landmines aren't that sensitive. They are rated to explode for people/vehicles, but you don't want your minefield revealed because a mouse decided to run across it. So its fine (sadly I guess) Bonus question: why do minefields not become forests? Like I would not like to be the guy to cut the grass there. A quick and dirty answer, based on nothing but high school Physics. I did the Math for a [PM-1 antipersonnel mine]( URL_0 ). Diameter: 0.112 m Activating weight: 5.8 kg Density of water: 1000 kg / m^3 Height of a column of water needed to trigger the mine: 5.8 / ( & pi; * (0.112 / 2)^2 * 1000) = 0.59 m Or about 2 feet, if you're a Merkin. (Don't forget that snow is mostly air, so 0.59 m of precipitation would be several metres of snow.) Looking at [a climate graph for Seoul]( URL_1 ), which isn't too far from the DMZ, we see that winters are pretty dry, so there's unlikely to be anything like that much precipitation. As for your question about walking over a minefield. The snow will distribute the walker's weight, so the mine will feel less pressure from the walker. But if you're unlucky, that slight pressure increase, in combination with the weight of the snow, might be enough to trigger the mine. I wouldn't chance it.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 72.0, 'recall': 4.72, 'fmeasure': 8.86}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.37, 'recall': 1.18, 'fmeasure': 2.22}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 52.0, 'recall': 3.41, 'fmeasure': 6.4}}"
What's a cellular automaton ?,"A cellular automaton is a system where you have a grid of cells, and a set of rules that dictate how a cell changes to another cell based on its current state. The rules are applied in a sequence, and the next state of the cells is determined. The interesting thing is that the rules are applied in a deterministic way, meaning that given a specific initial state, the same sequence of rules will always result in the same final state. This is similar to how a computer works. In a computer, the instructions are executed in a deterministic way, and the final state of the computer is determined by the sequence of instructions. This is what makes computers so powerful, because they can execute instructions in a deterministic way, and thus perform any calculation. The rules in a cellular automaton are applied in a similar way. The interesting thing about cellular automata is that the rules can be very simple, yet the behavior of the system can be incredibly complex. The rules are applied in a deterministic way, but the complexity of the system comes from the fact that the rules are applied in a grid of cells, and thus there are many possible combinations of rules that can be applied. This means that there are many possible states that can be reached, and thus the system can exhibit very complex behavior.","For starters, it's not really an essential part of understanding computing. The idea came about as more of an entertaining thing to do with computers. At best, they're a footnote in the history of computing. Take a grid. Each cell of that grid can either have a thing in it or not. Now, given some rule based on the neighboring cells, you can decide if that cell has a thing in it for the next generation. The original example was [Conway's Game of Life]( URL_0 ), the rule were fairly simple: 1. A live cell with 1 or 0 live neighbors dies of loneliness. 2. A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors is happy and survives. 3. A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies of overcrowding 4. A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors gets colonized with new life. With these 4 simple rules, it turns out that surprisingly complex patterns can arise. There's a virtually limitless number of different rule sets you can come up with, all of which have different patterns of behavior. To build on what /u/ameoba said, a cellular automaton does not have to be a 2D grid and doesn't have to rely on just immediate neighbors. The second most famous series of cellular automata are the one dimensional ones by Stephen Wolfram. Basically, you have a single line made up of cells. Each cell can be on or off. You draw a line below that based on a simple set of rules determined by a cell and its immediate neighbors. There are 255 possible rules and some produce some really [pretty mathematically significant patterns]( URL_0 ).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 39.06, 'recall': 32.16, 'fmeasure': 35.27}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.9, 'recall': 5.67, 'fmeasure': 6.23}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.88, 'recall': 15.55, 'fmeasure': 17.05}}"

How are dams built? Wouldn’t the water get in the way if it was built ground up?,"...
I am not an engineer, but I can try to explain it. Dams are built with a combination of concrete, steel, and earth. The dam is built up from the ground up, but the water is allowed to flow through it. The dam is built in sections, and the water is allowed to flow through the dam as it is built. When the dam is finished, the water is allowed to back up and fill the reservoir. The dam is made of concrete and steel, and the water is allowed to flow through it. The dam is built on the sides of the river, and it is made to hold back the water. The dam is built in sections, and the water is allowed to flow through it.

Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.,"Want a simple explanation of the concept of hysteresis? Let's say you have a simple circuit with a resistor, capacitor, and inductor. If the voltage across the circuit changes, the current will change. But if the current changes, the voltage will change. This is called hysteresis. The relationship between the voltage and current is non-linear. The voltage and current change in a different way when the current changes than when the voltage changes. This is the hysteresis loop.  eresis loop is a graph of the voltage vs the current. It is a parabola, with a minimum point at the origin. The minimum point is where the voltage and current are equal. The parabola is a mirror image of itself, so the minimum point is the same on both sides of the origin. If you look at the parabola, you will see that it is symmetric around the origin. If you draw a line from the origin to the minimum point, and then draw a line perpendicular to that line, you will see that the line is also a parabola. The parabola is a mirror image of itself, so the minimum point is the same on both sides of the origin.  eresis loop is a mirror image of itself, so the minimum point is the same on both sides of the origin. This is the reason for the name hysteresis.  ","Try this one on for size: You have an intelligent self driving car. One of the things it does is turn on the headlights when it gets dark. (Ignore local laws about driving with your lights on, OK?) Well, imagine it's dusk, and it's just on that level where it's nearly dark enough to turn the lights on. So the detector that decides whether it turns on or off is constantly flipping on and off, and the headlights constantly flash. Introducing hysteresis. We set two different thresholds, so that when it gets dark, we turn them on. However, it has to be a lot brighter before we turn them off again. Now the headlights will be staying on until morning. That distance between where we turn something on or off is the hysteresis of the system. Hysteresis is a tendency to ""stick"" in a certain state. Consider the a toilet tank. When the tank is empty a float drops which opens a valve which fills the tank. When the tank fills it lifts the float until the water shuts off. But what if you remove just a little water? If you remove a couple of tablespoons, it won't turn on. You probably have to remove a few cups before it turns on. Once it does turn on, it won't stop until it reaches the original water level. That's hysteresis.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 30.3, 'recall': 29.79, 'fmeasure': 30.04}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.22, 'recall': 5.13, 'fmeasure': 5.17}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 16.88, 'recall': 16.6, 'fmeasure': 16.74}}"
Do blender setting really make a difference?,"In a nutshell: No. But you can make a difference with how you use them. For example, if you're trying to get a smooth, detailed image, you might want to use a higher quality renderer. If you're trying to get a fast, low-quality image, you might want to use a lower quality renderer. But it's not going to change the image itself. The settings you choose in Blender affect the amount of time it takes to render, and the quality of the final image. The higher the quality, the longer it will take to render. The lower the quality, the shorter it will take to render. But the quality of the final image will not change. So if you want to render a high quality image, you should choose a high quality renderer.   a low quality image, you should choose a low quality renderer.

SOAP versus REST for web development," The web is a vast, complex and constantly evolving landscape. In the early days of the web, there was a single dominant protocol: HTTP. However, as the web evolved, new technologies emerged that could help make the web more efficient and powerful. Two of the most important of these technologies are SOAP and  . In this article, we'll take a closer look at both and explore the differences between them. What is SOAP? SOAP is an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol. It is a set of rules that govern how different applications communicate with each other over the web. The core idea behind SOAP is that applications should be able to communicate with each other using a standardized language, making it easier for developers to build applications that can communicate with each other. SOAP is based on XML, a markup language that describes how data is structured. The data is sent as a series of XML messages, which are sent back and forth between the applications. What is  ?   stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a way of building web services that is based on the idea of resources and how they can be manipulated.   is all about how web services can be designed to be simple and easy to use.   is built around the idea of resources, which are pieces of data that can be manipulated.   is based on HTTP, which is the protocol that governs how web data is transmitted.  ","> I've read that SOAP is like putting your letter(request) in an envelope to make it more secure, while REST is just sending is the letter(request) as is. This is complete nonsense. The difference has absolutely nothing to do with security. Neither SOAP nor REST have encryption as part of the protocol. Someone apparently heard that SOAP has something called an ""envelope"" and completely misunderstood what that means. SOAP has a very detailed (and complex) specification on the message format level, and it is completely based on XML. It doesn't actually need to use HTTP, anything that can deliver text messages and responses works. The important difference is that with SOAP, the messages themselves contain all the information. When used over HTTP, a SOAP web service will have a single URL, and you use it by making a POST request to that URL and sending an XML which says something like ""this is a GetOrderList request and here are its parameters"", and in response you will receive an XML with says ""this as a GetOrderList response, and here is the data"". The advantage is that you have these exact specifications that tell you how requests and responses look like, and they will always follow the same basic rules in every system that uses SOAP. The disadvantage is that the specification (and the XML itself) result in quite a lot of overhead and complexity even if you want to send very simple messages. It is *not* enjoyable to use. In contrast, REST does not really have a standard, it just tries to use the elements of the HTTP standard (URLs, different HTTP methods, some of them previously almost forgotten) directly as part of the ""web service"" concept, the way you described it. This means that it is not really possible to use REST via anything but HTTP. The *format* of REST messages is actually not specified at all, it is typically JSON, but can be XML or even something else. The advantage is that it's simpler and much more pleasant to program, but since there is no real standard, every REST API works a little different, there can be surprises hidden, and in fact many APIs that call themselves REST actually don't follow the basic REST concepts at all - anything where one URL is used for different kinds of requests based on the *content* of the message is not ""RESTful"".","{'rouge1': {'precision': 51.44, 'recall': 30.94, 'fmeasure': 38.64}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.09, 'recall': 5.46, 'fmeasure': 6.82}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.46, 'recall': 14.11, 'fmeasure': 17.62}}"
Why do archers say you should not fire a bow without an arrow?,"It's not just for safety. If you fire a bow without an arrow, the bowstring will still vibrate and create a tiny bit of energy.

It's also worth noting that the bowstring will also stretch a bit when fired without an arrow, which will also affect the accuracy of your next shot.","Dry firing in archery refers to the loosing of the string of a bow or other weapon without ammunition, which should never be done.

"How is it so easy to open a refrigerator from the outside, but so difficult or nearly impossible to open from the inside?","The key is the weight. The fridge door is heavy, and the lock mechanism is designed to hold that door closed. The lock is not designed to keep the door closed if the weight is removed, like when you open it from the inside. There is no pressure on the lock from the inside, and no weight to keep it closed. When you open it from the outside, the lock is able to keep the door closed because of the weight of the door. The lock on your fridge is called a latch, and it's designed to keep the door closed until you want it open. There's a spring in the latch that keeps it closed, and a small motor that moves the latch back and forth.

How does the escapement of a mechanical clock maintain a constant rhythm even though the force from the spring/motor will vary?," a clock is made up of a series of gears.

","It is designed with the arch upstream so that the pressure of the water strengthens the dam as the water presses it against the foundations and abutements. Edit to add: PBS does a better job than I ""The Hoover Dam is a curved gravity dam. Lake Mead pushes against the dam, creating compressive forces that travel along the great curved wall. The canyon walls push back, counteracting these forces. This action squeezes the concrete in the arch together, making the dam very rigid.” Cement/concrete is really strong against things that try to squish it and crush it, but really weak against things that try to pull it apart, we put rebar in it to help but it's still wayyyy stronger against squishing The curve of the dam means that as the water pushes on it it will try to become straight, but becoming straight would require it get wider but there are cliffs that push back against that. This puts the load on the dam in the way it is strongest since pushing in the middle creates a squishing force on the dam materials If you have a straight dam then the water behind would be pushing the middle outward, this will try to stretch the dam forward and it is very weak to that so it won't be able to hold as much water back Arches and domes are much better at spreading force than straight lines are. The arched shape of a dam lets the force of the water run along the dam and into the supporting structure. If you want a tactile analogy, try squeezing an egg along the long axis. You’ll find that it’s surprisingly difficult to crush. The curved shape of the egg distributes the load similarly to how the curve of a dam distributes the load.

"With all the technological advances of the current millennium, why are flights from Point A to Point B the same duration as decades ago? Why aren't commercial airplanes flying significantly faster today than decades ago?"," ELI5: Why don’t planes fly faster? Why is the speed of planes limited? The reason is that air travel is a very expensive and risky endeavor. If you were to take a plane that was capable of flying at speeds much faster than the current speed limits, it would be very expensive to build such a plane. The plane would need to be incredibly strong to withstand the forces of the wind at those speeds, and the engine would need to be incredibly powerful to generate enough thrust. It would also be very difficult to control such a plane. The pilot would need to be incredibly skilled to handle the plane, and there would be a very high risk of accidents. Additionally, the fuel consumption of such a plane would be very high, and it would be very expensive to fly. This means that the cost of flying would be very high, and the number of people that would be able to afford to fly would be very low. This would make air travel less accessible to people, which would be a very bad thing. So, instead of building planes that are capable of flying much faster than the current speed limits, the industry is focused on building planes that are safe and reliable, and that are affordable to fly. The speed of planes is limited by the amount of fuel that they can carry.  ","Commercial airliners fly just under the speed of sound, and have for a while now. They do this because supersonic flight is *much* more expensive. It requires very expensive new aircraft, burns a ton of fuel, and is outlawed over land in many places because of sonic booms. A few supersonic commercial aircraft have been tried, but they were not successes. Turns out most people aren't willing to pay five times as much to get there twice as fast. The short answer is this, when a aircraft flies faster then the speed of sound it suddenly becomes a lot more expensive to operate. Even though it spends less time in the air it still costs a ton more to fly above the speed of sound then just below it, so in the interest of reasonable ticket prices airliners stay just below the speed of sound. Here's the long answer, sorry if I don't simplify this enough as it is more advanced. Sound is pressure waves moving through matter, whether that be wood, rock, metal or air. This speed at which this pressure waves moves can vary between material and how tightly packed that material is but what's important for us is that it's always around 343m/s in our atmosphere. Now well that is the speed the wave moves at, what's more important is why it moves at that speed. That reason is because a pressure wave (sound) moves by particles being hit in a constant direction and hitting other molecules of air and transferring energy to them, in a way similar to a [Newtons Cradle]( URL_5 ). The closer, or more dense the air is the faster this can occur. The way this all relates to aircraft is that, wave speed is constant regardless of how fast the input (an aircraft) is moving, this in effect makes it so that the speed of sound also is the speed at which air moving away from an object it collides with. This result of this is that as an aircraft goes faster then the speed of sound the molecules of air move away slower then the plane moves forward. As a direct result of this, the pressure of the air in front of the wing suddenly increases dramatically because instead of moving away in sound waves it's now bunched up in one spot forming an area of much higher pressure which creates the distinctive sonic boom. Higher pressure does more then just create a nice boom though, it also creates considerably more drag since the aircraft now has to push more air out of the way then it did before, which results in higher fuel costs since the engines have to burn more fuel to maintain said speed. There's also a lot of other REALLY weird effects that going supersonic has but that's the jist of it. The above is why airliners don't go supersonic, however most airliners actually cruise at Mach ~0.85 (mach is % speed of sound) instead of literally just below it (Mach 0.99). The reason for this is actually pretty straight forward, wings work by having lower pressure on top of the wing and lower pressure on the bottom of the wing. The way this pressure differential is achieved is by having the air on top of the wing moves faster then air on the bottom of the wing (The physics behind that are far beyond the scope of even this wall of text, so just [watch this]( URL_2 ) if you need to know more). This means that the air on top of the wing will go faster then speed of sound before the entire aircraft does, along with the increased drag that incurs (and even worse stuff like control surfaces tending to not work). This are is called the transonic region (trasnition and supersonic combined) and well planes can and do fly in this speed range it's simply easier and slightly cheaper to keep them that little bit slower. *deep breath* ok, so that was the aerodynamic side of the issue, here's the governmental side of the issue. Sonic booms are loud. really loud. Like 60,000ft isn't enough to not make them annoying loud. Therefore it's illegal to fly supersonic over the US (except in certain designated corridors). This means that any supersonic aircraft could only service overseas routes like the Concorde's New York to London route. In reality this isn't actually *that* bad since long haul routes are what really fast planes are good for, what does make it bad is that it cuts off the entire trans-continental market. Even then though it wasn't, and isn't the sonic boom that makes supersonic transports non-viable. The other two hurdles that aren't the laws of physics (at least not directly) are the ozone layer and takeoff noise. Supersonic transports typically need to fly really high in order to reduce drag and dissipate heat better, that alone isn't a problem. What is a problem is that they fly so high that, at least in the 60's when the Concorde was coming out, people believed that they might make a hole in the Ozone layer. I don't know if there's scientific truth to that statement, but it did hurt the development of the Concorde so I feel it should be listed if only briefly. The other factor was noise at takeoff and landing, long story short the Concorde used jet engines that were much louder then jet engines used on normal airliners (and it goes to reason any new supersonic plane will need them as well), to be more specific there were straight up afterburning turbojets which is as loud as you can get jet engine wise (I used to have a old ELI5 for this but I can't find it). These engines were so loud that pretty much every airport the Concorde was planning on servicing banned it, minus the ones on the trans-atlantic route between New York/London, and a few other cities (not that they didn't try). This caused everybody who wanted a Concorde to suddenly not want a Concorde and Air France/British Airways got stuck with it. So those are the problems facing a supersonic transport as well as why we don't have them anymore. But why is nobody trying to make one? Well, some people are, but those companies are dubious at best (not saying they won't succeed, just saying we'll see the Spanish inquisition coming before I predict it). Thankfully this is the one part of this topic that is simple (hallelujah). Developing an airliner, or even a business jet is stupid expensive. For example, Boeing barely turns a profit from it's 787 (at least I think they did) and that's a conservative guaranteed to succeed type design. A supersonic transport is a massive gamble in an industry where there is no room to gamble. Bar government funding of some sort or a massive improvement in drag reduction (among other things) making these things feasible we're really not likely to see a supersonic transport anytime soon. That's why airliners stay at about that max speed, but why don't we go even slower to save more money? Simple answer: people thought that would happen but it's all around better to go faster until drag starts getting exponentially higher. Long answer: it's time for a history lesson. After WWII and the invention of the jet engine it didn't take long for people to figure out how to make very powerful propeller engines that used a jet engine to spin the propeller instead of a piston engine (commonly known as a turboprop). When these came out aircraft manufacturers thought that these engines would simply replace the increasingly complex piston engines airliners were starting to utilize since the turboprops were far more reliable and all around simpler. They were aware of straight jet engines (called turbojets) but simply thought they were to unreliable and inefficient to catch on. This gave rise to planes like the [Lockheed Electra]( URL_0 ). Inevitably people tried putting turbojets into airliners but, that ended up in the [Comet]( URL_1 ) which was... not a good plane (it had an issue of breaking apart mid-air). So people still thought turboprops would be the way of the future, then Boeing released it's [707]( URL_3 ) which was hugely successful and resulted in other companies rushing to catch up with planes such as the [DC-8]( URL_4 ) (To be fair, this was just as much a way for Boeing to make a jet tanker as well). After the success of both of these planes a turboprop simply couldn't compete since jet's were faster and about as expensive, though they still are sometimes used on short routes where speed is less of an issue . Flying faster uses more fuel. Fuel is by far the most expensive cost to the airline. They fly at the planes best fuel efficiency. This is the ""same"" as decades ago because as you get close to breaking the sound barrier, it's physically more difficult to go faster (uses more fuel than its worth). The deciding factor for the vast majority of travelers is cost, not time. Airlines care about costs, to keep prices competitive. Edit: I'm half asleep, and poorly summarized [this video]( URL_0 ) check out their other videos on airplanes and airlines. It's fascinating (to me at least) The Concorde was a super sonic jet that cut travel time significantly. However, the cost to operate was a huge drawback. Also, flying super sonic above the continental U.S. isn't allowed by passenger planes. The Concorde required an additional engineer in the cockpit raising operation costs. Overall it's cheaper to operate as is. I believe that Boeing is pursuing super sonic flight again though so maybe in the future that will change! You’ll be suprised because the majority of commercial planes flying today were designed before the new century. But that’s irrelevant. The biggest reason is that on shorter and more dense routes with higher traffic, regardless of how fast a plane can go max speed, they may need to slow down for sequencing. However on longer and less populated routes these routes have gotten faster. Edit: Cost index is something to look into also. We could fly faster but it would be so expensive to the passenger that only few could afford it. The few that can afford it fly smaller private jets that do fly higher and faster than large commercial planes. The duration of a flight on a private jet is very quick when you consider you don’t have to bother with airport lines, security, baggage claims, etc.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 71.61, 'recall': 9.25, 'fmeasure': 16.38}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 20.43, 'recall': 2.63, 'fmeasure': 4.66}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.41, 'recall': 5.09, 'fmeasure': 9.02}}"
"How does plumbing actually work? Why can toilets, sinks, and showers work without electricity (minus having hot water because electricity of course)?","- 1. Water supply - The water supply is typically fed by a well or a municipal water supply. Water is pumped into a water tower and then gravity feeds the water into the house. The water supply is usually filtered to remove impurities. Water supply is not electricity dependent. - 2. Water distribution - Water from the water supply is fed into the home through pipes. The pipes are usually made of copper or PVC and are insulated to keep water from freezing in cold weather. Water is distributed throughout the home through a series of valves that control the flow of water. Water is distributed to the sink, toilet, shower, and washing machine. - 3. Water heating - Water is heated by a gas or electric water heater. The water heater is usually located in a basement or utility room. Water is heated by a gas or electric heating element and stored in a tank. The water is heated to a desired temperature and distributed to the fixtures in the home.

But everyone knows being an electrician is better than being a plumber. Source: I’m an electrician > How does plumbing actually work? Why can toilets, sinks, and showers work without electricity (minus having hot water because electricity of course)? Sinks, showers, and toilets work because the water supply has pressure behind it. This is achieved with pumps (which require electricity) but can also be maintained by simply placing a reservoir of water in a high place. Water towers are a common example of this method of achieving a constant pressure on the water supply. In the same way that blowing on water in a straw will force out out the other end, the pressure of the water supply will force it out of the shower or faucet. Someone else mentioned water towers. I'm gonna expand on that a little. Under normal operation, a water tower has electric pumps moving water up into them throughout the day. We *could* just not build a tower and use those pumps directly to move the water into homes, but the water tower provides an advantage: we don't need electricity to make water flow downwards, so if the pumps lose power, the water in the towers will still flow down and out to the homes and businesses where it's needed. Most water towers contain at least a day's supply of water, so it would take a pretty major disaster for one to run out of water.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 40.29, 'recall': 32.55, 'fmeasure': 36.01}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.76, 'recall': 7.87, 'fmeasure': 8.71}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.3, 'recall': 18.82, 'fmeasure': 20.82}}"
What could go wrong to lead an electrical outlet to spew water?,"It's not the outlet itself that spews water. It's the grounding system that the outlet is connected to. If the grounding system is not properly connected to the earth, then it can cause a build up of electrical charge. When this charge is strong enough, it can cause water to be drawn out of the ground and into the outlet. The most common cause of this is a faulty grounding rod.","Plumbing in the wall either bursts or a connection fails, which leads to water pouring out into the interior of the wall. In most cases your wall is just some drywall boards nailed to an open wood frame, filled with insulation. An outlet is usually just a plastic or metal box with holes on every side for wires to feed into, and the outlet itself is just mounted onto this box, most of which is sitting inside this inner space by cutting a hole in the drywall. The holes you see on a wall outlet are really just there to guide plugs into position to make contact with metal and complete the circuit, so they aren't sealed or anything special, and a cover plate forms a loose seal against every other part of the outlet. Long story short, if a pipe bursts in your wall, water pours in and, unless it has a path to drain straight down (not usually the case because of the aforementioned insulation), it will look for the path of least resistance - in this case, into your outlet box and out the plug holes. Not electrical fault would cause that of course, but it does mean you have an issue. My first thought would be **turn off that circuit at the breaker immediately**. Is it against an outside wall? It could be you have a leak from outside that is making it's way into the box. Either way that is a safety hazard for sure.

How come a mechanical watch changes it’s time over a long period of time,"It's a mechanical watch, so it's not running off a battery. It's running off of a spring. The spring is wound up when you wind the watch, and it slowly unwinds over time, which is why the watch loses time. If you wind it up, it will gain time.","For starters, if it's been running nonstop since ""a few years ago"", I doubt it's actually a mechanical watch. A mechanical watch, one driven by a wound up spring and gears, can only run for a few days without needing to be wound. It's far more likely that you have some sort of quartz watch - where a battery run electricity through a crystal and count the vibrations - that simply has an analog face (ie - moving hands instead of an LCD display). Quartz watches can run for years on a single battery without a problem - smart ones can even stop moving the hands to save power & just slide them back to where they belong once motion is detected. That out of the way... Watches and clocks all do one simple thing internally: they make something happen periodically and count how many times it happens. A grandfather clock tracks swings of a pendulum, a mechanical watch tracks the oscillations of a spring loaded weight & quartz movements run electricity through a quartz crystal, causing it to vibrate and they count those vibrations. If the speed of that periodic thing isn't precisely tuned, the timepiece might run slightly fast or slow. Being off by only 20 minutes in a year means that it's 99.996% accurate - if it's been multiple years, that's even more accurate. One source I found online says that typical mechanical watches are typically only accurate to within 10 seconds per day & quartz watches are generally within about 15s per month. If you want to spend more money, you can get more accuracy - as little as 5s per year - but even a $100-150 watch can do 15s/year (as long as you prioritize accuracy over flashiness). All of that pales in comparison to sensitive scientific instruments. Atomic clocks can *easily* be accurate to within a second every million years. The current record is [accurate to 1 second every 15 billion years]( URL_0 ). It's essentially impossible to create a mechanical watch that counts time completely accurately, especially given that the internal mechanism changes its timekeeping based on the temperature and other environmental factors. The best mechanical watches typically keep time to within a second per day, which is only an error of about 0.001%, but can easily build up to being off by many minutes if you let them run for long enough.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 75.0, 'recall': 9.7, 'fmeasure': 17.18}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 21.57, 'recall': 2.74, 'fmeasure': 4.87}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 44.23, 'recall': 5.72, 'fmeasure': 10.13}}"
Why does the temperature surrounding an LED affect the brightness?,"LEDs are essentially a very efficient incandescent bulb. They use a special semiconductor material to control the flow of electricity. When electricity is passed through the material, it causes a chemical reaction that releases energy in the form of light. The color of the light depends on the specific material used. In the case of red LEDs, the material is usually a red phosphor, which absorbs some of the light emitted and re-emits it as red light. The temperature of the LED affects the color of the light in a couple of ways. The first is that the temperature affects the amount of energy available to the phosphor. The higher the temperature, the more energy is available to the phosphor, which results in a brighter light. The second is that the temperature affects the efficiency of the phosphor. At higher temperatures, the phosphor becomes less efficient at converting energy into light. This is because the phosphor is heated by the electricity and this increases the rate of chemical reactions. When the chemical reactions are faster, the light is less intense. The effect is more pronounced in LEDs that use a red phosphor. This is because the phosphor is less efficient at higher temperatures. LEDs that use a blue phosphor are less affected by temperature.","Because how much light it gives off depends on the amount of electricity goes through it. Changes in temperature can change the resistance of a material, which changes how much electricity goes into the LED, which changed how bright it is.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 11.16, 'recall': 58.54, 'fmeasure': 18.75}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.8, 'recall': 15.0, 'fmeasure': 4.72}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 6.51, 'recall': 34.15, 'fmeasure': 10.94}}"

Why does a car door get stuck if the driver unlocks the door at the same time that the passenger is trying to open it?," Painful and frustrating, right? It’s especially frustrating when the passenger is trying to get out of the car, and the driver is trying to get in. So why does this happen? The answer lies in the design of the lock mechanism itself. When the driver unlocks the door, the lock is released and the door can swing open. But when the passenger tries to open the door, the lock is still engaged, and the door will not swing open. The passenger must wait until the driver unlocks the door again before the passenger can get out. This is because the driver’s side door has a lock mechanism that is designed to keep the passenger’s side door locked. The lock is designed to keep the passenger’s side door locked until the driver’s side door is unlocked. This is to prevent the passenger from getting out of the car without the driver’s permission.

How do Wind Turbines work and how do they compare to other sources of producing electricity?," I know this is a long question but I hope you can help me understand. I'm a 15 year old student. The main difference between wind turbines and other sources of electricity is that wind turbines use wind as a source of energy, whereas other sources of electricity use fossil fuels such as coal, oil, or gas.   turbines work by using wind to turn a series of blades attached to a shaft. As the blades turn, the shaft is connected to a generator which converts the mechanical energy of the spinning shaft into electrical energy.   turbines are often grouped together in a wind farm, where a large number of turbines are connected together to generate a large amount of electricity. This is more efficient than generating electricity from a single turbine, and also makes it easier to transport the electricity to where it is needed.   turbines are a clean source of energy, which means that they don't produce any pollution or greenhouse gases. They are also renewable, which means that they will never run out of energy. However, they are not always available. The wind doesn't always blow, and when it does, it may not be strong enough to generate electricity. So, in order to balance this, wind farms are often connected to a grid, where the electricity is stored and then released when it is needed.  ","Pretty much all generators use the same principle. **Magnet** \+ **copper coils** \+ **motion** \=\ #electricity. The differences between how the electricity is generated comes from the motion part of the equation. The largest turbines put out around 1000 megawatts and are fueled by natural gas. A single wind turbine puts out less than 1/100th of that volume of electricity, but the fuel cost is zero. How: Wind makes blades spin, blades rotate a turbine, turbine generates electricity. Compare: The largest individual wind turbine is 9 Megawatts. Turbines powered by other means can be hundreds of Megawatts in rating. In addition, they only spin when the wind blows, and will only spin as fast as the wind can push them. Their benefits are being environmentally friendly and not requiring fuel.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 25.65, 'recall': 46.09, 'fmeasure': 32.96}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.06, 'recall': 5.51, 'fmeasure': 3.93}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.04, 'recall': 23.44, 'fmeasure': 16.76}}"
Why do some engines have a much lower redline?,"There are a few reasons. One reason is that the engine's redline is a design choice. It's not a hard and fast rule, but rather a way to determine the limits of the engine's design. For example, if an engine is designed to produce 250 horsepower at 6000 RPM, then it's probably not a good idea to rev it to 8000 RPM because it'll start to lose power. This is just a rough estimate, but it's a good idea to keep in mind. Another reason is that engines are designed to be efficient, not powerful. They don't have to be the most powerful engine in the world to be efficient. For example, a small engine might be designed to be efficient at 2000 RPM rather than 6000 RPM. This is a good thing, because it means that the engine is using less fuel and making less noise. A third reason is that engines are designed to last. They don't have to be the most powerful engine in the world to last. For example, a diesel engine might be designed to last for 200,000 miles rather than 100,000 miles.  ","Most of it comes down to mass in motion. The more mass that has to be moved further gives a lower red line. I have a 8.3L V10 in my car. The redline is at 6k. The pistons are large and they move quite a long distance. By the time you make it to 6k it sounds like the gates of hell have opened up. Smaller engines like my motorcycle can rev up to 17k or more. They are smaller with little stroke movement. The valve train moves very little also. With that combination it can move much faster without parts breaking. Mass in motion. The more mass the less motion. Parts can only withstand a certain amount of stress before breaking. It's important to understand, the goal of burning fuel is to produce hot expansive gasses; the consequential pressure pushes on a piston as it tries to find equilibrium. This action is called force, and when it's transformed from linear motion to rotational motion, it's thus called torque - torque is force about an axis. Gasoline engines have a fixed charge of fuel and air that enters a cylinder and is burned, whereas a modern diesel has an initial mix of fuel and air entered into the cylinder, which is ignited by the heat of compression, and then subsequent injections of fuel are introduced during combustion. As a consequence, gasoline engines only produce torque for a fraction of the power stroke, and diesel engines produce torque for the entire power stroke. No diesel engine will run higher than ~5k rpm because diesel fuel *doesn't burn fast enough*. If you ran the engine faster, which is certainly possible, you'll be dumping still burning, still hot and expanding gasses out the exhaust manifold. I'd be a flame throwing explosion past the valve and down the manifold. Diesel engines, then are designed around the advantages of energy density and stability of the fuel and the speed at which it burns. Gasoline burns very fast and is very volatile. Gasoline used to be a waste product before the invention of the internal combustion engine because it was too evaporative and explody. F1 race cars engines are are speed limited by rules, because it was, like, 2008 Ferrari had a 22k rpm engine and they were working on a 25k one. None of the competition had the money or resources to compete, hence the 18-some-k rpm limit. That's how fast gasoline burns. And F1 cars run off (highly refined, if not pure octane) gasoline. Here, the limiting factor is not the fuel, but the mass of the engine components. I think they're running 1.6 L v6 engines, normally aspirated (vacuum pressure sucks charge into the cylinder when the piston strokes down on the intake stroke), and they're still making +700 hp, which is a measure of work. What is work? Think of it this way, if you want to move across a room in half the time, you need to perform twice the work, you don't need twice the force. How do they do that, when my sports car 3.5 L v6 makes 300 hp? If you want to make 700 hp, you need to breathe 700 hp worth of air. These engines are over-square, which means the pistons are wider than the length of their stroke. They move up and down less than an inch. The pistons and rods are made of aluminum, or titanium, or I've heard of connecting rods now made with some sort of carbon fiber type material. All in the name of reducing weight. My sports car engine's pistons at 7.5k rpm are moving the same top speed at the half way point down the cylinder as an F1 engine, but mine has several inches to speed up and slow down, and the rate it has to stop and change directions is much lower. The F1 engine has to stop and change directions more often in the same period of time, at 18k rpm, and less than an inch to do it. The connecting rod actually stretches and compresses, I think up to 1/2"" in some cases. If their components were made from the same shit as my sports car, the engine would explode from the weight alone. Can gasoline burn faster? Yes, but at this point it's a materials problem. Understand that high speed engines are a means to an end. F1 started building fast engines only because the league banned turbochargers in the 80s. If they had that option, these engines would run much slower, because there are more efficient ways of making power. Also be aware that these engines are at the fringes of what's physically possible. F1 regulation requires an engine to last 2 races. They had to impose that because the top teams were pushing their engines so hard they only lasted one race, and smaller teams couldn't compete. This is why street cars don't run stupid fast engines, because the fuel required to do so is expensive as hell, and the maintenance requirements are unsustainable.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 65.15, 'recall': 14.91, 'fmeasure': 24.27}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.24, 'recall': 3.7, 'fmeasure': 6.03}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.3, 'recall': 6.94, 'fmeasure': 11.29}}"
Why do abandoned houses fall apart structurally?,"I think you're asking about tortoises, and the short answer is that they're very slow. They don't really have a lot of muscle mass, so they don't need a lot of food. Also, they don't really have to move around that much. So they can just sit there and slowly eat plants for a long time. Tortoises have a very low metabolism, and they don't need to eat much to survive. They don't have a lot of muscle mass, so they don't need to eat a lot of food.

When an occupied house develops a leak, or a tree branch falls through the roof, or termites infest it, or it suffers minor fire damage, the owners fix it.

Similarly, homeless people, vandals, and thieves are less likely to intrude and damage/take from a house with residents. If someone lives there, you’d worry about getting shot/arrested/etc. if you broke in.

Why is there no warning light for when your headlights or breaklights are no longer functioning?,"There are a couple of reasons. One is that a lot of the time, it's not really a safety issue. The headlights and brake lights are there to help other drivers see you, but they're not the only thing that does that. The car itself is very visible, and even if the headlights are off, you're still visible. The other reason is that if there was a warning light, it would be annoying. You'd be constantly having to check your lights to see if they're working, and you'd have to get used to the idea that the light might be off. There are some cars that do have a warning light, but it's rare.","In some newer car models, if your indicator is clicking faster than usual, you have a bulb out. Not really an answer to your question but a small tip. If a headlight is out, it's usually pretty obvious. If a taillight is out, the parking brake indicator usually comes on. Depends on my car, my old VW golf absolutely did give me a light when my license plate was out (actually, shop installed wrong replacement that made it think it was out). Expensive/newer cars will generally tell you if it's out. Older/cheaper cars frequently do not because it's just a lot of electronics. The right way to check a light is every light needs to be wired individually, then power tested (it needs to use a well known amount of power), this requires electronically switching the light onto the power testing circuit. The circuit doing this needs to be able to actually power the light for test, so it can't be just the 1 cent circuits, it's going to be a rather substantial circuit, and it needs to interface with all the switches. In practice, adding the function to the car probably adds a couple dollars to the price which is rather significant.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.28, 'recall': 26.67, 'fmeasure': 33.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.17, 'recall': 5.26, 'fmeasure': 6.69}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.01, 'recall': 10.95, 'fmeasure': 13.9}}"
How do electronic devices use so many watts of power considering Ohm's Law?,"So, let's say you have a 12V battery, and you want to use 1A of current.

Sometimes when working with systems you *do* use that kind of calculation, in a black-boxish kind of way, usually to figure out what a source or load 'looks like' to the other parts of the system. Like: if a transistor output is leading into a current-hungry circuit, the intrinsic resistance in the transistor will cause the output voltage to drop (as Ohm's law says it will)... so you might add an emitter follower (aka common collector amplifier) stage that has a large input impedance (high 'resistance') that won't load down the previous circuit and a small output impedance (low 'resistance') that can drive the 'hungry' circuit without sagging... it's basically the opposite of a resistor. It all adds up to that 600 watts in the end, but it doesn't do so in a straightforward Ohm's law manner.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 35.96, 'recall': 18.89, 'fmeasure': 24.77}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.88, 'recall': 0.46, 'fmeasure': 0.61}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.42, 'recall': 9.68, 'fmeasure': 12.69}}"

How does camouflage work on ships?,"It’s not so much camouflage but rather stealth technology. Stealth is achieved by reducing the radar signature of the ship.

This also includes the use of radar-absorbing radar systems, which can be used to jam or spoof radar signals. The ship also has to be designed to reduce the amount of noise that is emitted by the ship.

Ships use the sheer size of the ocean to stay hidden as long as possible by sailing to different spots outside of radar/sonar range and approaching from unexpected directions. At night they use deceptive lighting to give the appearance of a different kind of vessel. Another method is to control the RF and sound being emitted. An example might be only using a commercial radar and keeping the other radars off.

"Why are light sources (incandescence lamps, neon lamps, led lamps ) so inefficient? Why can't we produce light instead of heat?","The efficiency of light bulbs is a trade off between the amount of light produced and the amount of heat produced. There are a few reasons why light bulbs are not very efficient. The first is that the light produced by a light bulb is not pure light, it is a mixture of light and heat. The heat is produced when the electricity is converted into light. This is because of the way the light bulb works. A light bulb is essentially a glass tube with a wire filament inside. The wire filament is heated by the flow of electricity through it. As the filament is heated, it glows, producing light. However, this process also produces a lot of heat. The heat is produced because of the resistance of the wire filament. The more resistance there is, the more energy is wasted as heat. Because of this, incandescent bulbs are not very efficient. They are only about 2-3% efficient. The other reason why light bulbs are not very efficient is that they have a very long lifespan. Because of this, they are not used as much as other types of lighting, such as fluorescent lighting. However, this is a trade off because light bulbs are very cheap and long lasting. The heat produced by light bulbs is not just wasted, it also helps to keep you warm.  ","Atoms in lighting devices, when stimulated with energy, produce light at several frequencies. Unfortunately these generally include both the ones we want, and some other ones such as infrared (which we perceive as just heat). Scientists are working on ultra-high-efficiency LEDs that don't have this flaw, but it's hard -- no one designed atoms for this task. To excite something enough to emit visible light, you're probably also going to pour a certain amount of energy into the material as heat. That could be via the excitation process (e.g. tungsten filament bulbs are heated by the electricity passing through them until they emit light like any blackbody radiator) or it could be via photons hitting other atoms on the way out (thermalisation of photons as happens in the sun). LEDs are much, much better than filament bulbs, but still put out a surprising amount of heat - if you pick up an led and filament bulb, the led will be much heavier because of the heatsink. The other factor is that luminous efficiency is determined by how well our eyes can use the light, and they aren't equally good at all frequencies. That's why the 100% line in the table is for a particular frequency of green light. We wouldn't want all our homes illuminated in green (if you've got an RGB LED bulb you can try it, it's not very pleasant. People used to sell green bulbs for fridges so the food within wouldn't look as appetising).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 39.47, 'recall': 34.88, 'fmeasure': 37.04}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.49, 'recall': 6.61, 'fmeasure': 7.02}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.98, 'recall': 15.89, 'fmeasure': 16.87}}"
How does depleted uranium help penetrate armored vehicles?,"The most common form of depleted uranium is uranium-238. It is a radioactive, but relatively non-toxic, element. It is not particularly useful for penetrating armor. It is much more useful as a radioactive source for things like radiation detectors. In the 1990s, the US military began to use a different form of depleted uranium called uranium-235. It is radioactive and toxic. It is also highly dense and very hard. It is this form of depleted uranium that is used in armor-piercing rounds. It is used to penetrate armor because it is very hard and very dense. It is also very radioactive. This makes it very effective at penetrating armor, but also very dangerous to the people who are using it. The radiation released by depleted uranium is very dangerous. It can cause cancer, birth defects, and other serious health problems. It is also very dangerous to the environment. It can contaminate soil and water, and it can also cause long-term damage to the biosphere. As a result, the use of depleted uranium in armor-piercing rounds has been controversial. It is a very effective weapon, but it is also a very dangerous one.","Same way lead does. It's just heavy. As a result, it has more momentum once you get it going, making it harder to stop. Its relation to radiation has nothing to do with it. Uranium is simply heavy, even heavier than lead. The force or the kenetic energy or momentum of the bullet all depends on the mass. Uranium is very heavy, which means that it has a high mass (and greater density). So a lead bullet and a uranium bullet of the same size will have the same wind resistance characteristics, but the uranium bullet will pack a bigger wallop. Which is important if you're trying to penetrate two inches of steel. I actually quoted this earlier: > To understand why depleted uranium (DU) makes a good anti-tank weapon you have to enter the Alice In Wonderland world of high-energy collisions. When metal meets metal at five times the speed of sound, hardened steel shatters like glass. Metal flows like putty, or simply vaporises. A faster shell does not necessarily go through more armour, but, like a pebble thrown into a pond, it makes a bigger splash. > Armour penetration is increased by concentrating the force of a shell into as small an area as possible, so the projectiles tend to look like giant darts. The denser the projectile, the harder the impact for a given size. DU is almost twice as dense as lead, making it highly suitable. The other metal used for anti-tank rounds is tungsten, which is also very hard and dense. When a tungsten rod strikes armour, it deforms and mushrooms, making it progressively blunter. Uranium is ""pyrophoric"": at the point of impact it burns away into vapour, so the projectile stays sharp. When it breaks through, the burning DU turns the inside of a vehicle into an inferno of white-hot gas and sparks.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 42.93, 'recall': 27.16, 'fmeasure': 33.27}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.58, 'recall': 3.53, 'fmeasure': 4.32}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.19, 'recall': 12.14, 'fmeasure': 14.87}}"

How does ink get removed from paper in the recycling process?,"Ink is a soluble substance, meaning it dissolves in water. In the recycling process, the paper is first crushed and then soaked in a solution that breaks down the ink. The ink then dissolves and can be removed from the paper. Ink is made up of dyes, pigments, and resins. The resins are the most difficult to remove and require a specialized process. The dyes are removed with a solvent and the pigments are removed with a chemical that breaks them down into smaller particles that can be filtered out. Paper is made of fibers. When you recycle paper, the fibers are broken down and remade into a new paper product. The ink is removed by soaking the paper in water. The water causes the ink to dissolve and it can be drained away. The fibers are cleaned and flattened out and then they are re-formed into a new paper product.","After the recycled paper is turned back into pulp, a bleaching agent is used to remove the pigment from wood fibers.

How does a cars heat and cooling system work,"Okay, so, I'm a 26 year old mech engineer. I've worked on my fair share of cars, and I'm pretty good at it. I've got a 1994 Buick Lesabre, and I've done all the work on it myself. I'm also pretty handy with a wrench. So, I'm going to try my best to explain it in detail. I'm not going to go into the details of how the engine works, but I'll try to explain the cooling system. The cooling system is made up of the radiator, the thermostat, the water pump, and the hoses. The radiator is the part that you see in the front of the car. It's made up of two rows of tubes and a bunch of fins. The tubes are where the water flows through, and the fins are there to help the water flow better. The thermostat is a small valve that opens and closes to regulate the temperature of the water. When the water gets too hot, the thermostat opens, and the water goes to the radiator. When the water gets too cold, the thermostat closes, and the water goes back to the engine. The water pump is a small electric motor that pumps the water through the engine.  ","Heat is generated by the combustion engine transferred into the coolant through a heat exchanger (radiator) then pumped to another heat exchanger ( heater core) where it is transferred to the cabin air by a blower motor Heat is generated from the engine. The engine is using gasoline or diesel and making fire. It has alot of heat. It uses a water system to keep it cool. Some of the heated water is piped into a heat exchanger and fans blow out hot air. Most of the heat goes out on the cars exterior radiator. Cold air is made by an air conditioner. Compressed refrigerant is cold and absorbs heat, and evaporates into a gas, pumped outside, then compressed back into a liquid.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 23.61, 'recall': 41.8, 'fmeasure': 30.18}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.72, 'recall': 6.61, 'fmeasure': 4.76}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.89, 'recall': 24.59, 'fmeasure': 17.75}}"
How does a nuclear bomb explode before hitting the ground ?,"It doesn't. A nuclear bomb is essentially a very large nuclear reactor that has been designed to explode. The explosion is caused by a chain reaction of fission. The fission reaction is the splitting of atoms, which releases a tremendous amount of energy. The energy released is so great that it causes the bomb to explode. The explosion is caused by the rapid expansion of air in all directions. This expansion is caused by the heat generated by the fission reaction. The heat is so great that it causes the air to expand rapidly. The expansion of the air causes the bomb to explode. The explosion is so powerful that it can level a city.","Bombs are made for different purposes, those which explode on impact are designed to destroy what they actually hit, whilst those that explode in the air cause damage to a wider area. Nuclear bombs are an area effect weapon so they work best when detonated at altitude this can be triggered in a number of different ways one of which is using the difference in pressure at different heights. While some bombs are crude enough to rely on simple kinetic energy (slamming into the ground) to ignite, many — including nuclear bombs — are not set up that way and require a fuze. A fuze is just a little device that triggers the detonation. For a ground burst, a fuze might be a little button that gets pushed, which would set off a tiny explosion, that would set off the larger, main explosion. For an airburst, there are different kinds of fuzes that can be used either individually or together to make sure the bomb goes off at the right height. All of this applies to conventional as well as nuclear weapons, though with nuclear weapons it is especially important to have good fuzing because they will not typically explode in a nuclear fashion if they just slam into the ground without a fuze (they are complicated devices that require precise timing to work) Examples of aerial fuzing might include: * A timer that activates when the bomb leaves the plane or whatever. This is a very crude method but if you know it will take 45 seconds to fall to the right height, you can just time it. * A device that uses barometric pressure to detect how far up or down it is. The precision on this kind of thing can be tricky, but they have been used. * A device that serves essentially as a little radar antenna to detect where the ground is, by bouncing radio signals off of it. And so on. In the first atomic bombs, all three of these were used in a sequence to make sure that the bombs were more or less at the right altitude before they exploded (the timer made such the bomb was outside of the plane, the barometric switch made sure it was below a certain altitude, and the radar antenna did the final check). You could even use GPS for this sort of thing, though there are errors that might be added. Depending on the nature of the target you are trying to hit, there are pros and cons for setting the bomb off in the air or on the ground. Generally speaking if you are trying to hit something relatively small and ""hard"" — like, say, an underground bunker or silo, or a single building, even a large one, like the Pentagon — you want your bomb to go off as close to the target as possible, because it concentrates the most pressure on it. If you are trying to hit something relatively large and ""soft"" — like, say, a city — you want your bomb to go off in the air, because it disperses medium and light pressures over a larger area (for a variety of reasons). It is just a small note that for many years the nuclear weapons of the USA could _only_ be used as airbursts because it is actually much harder to make a heavy, complex, delicate instrument that goes off at exactly the moment it hits the ground (and before the collision breaks it) than it is to make one that detonates several hundred feed above the ground. i believe he is asking ""how"" in terms of how the process flows so the device always explodes before hitting the ground rather than ""why"" we let them explode above ground Blowing up a bomb in the air has a different effect than one hitting the ground, or even below the ground. An explosion in the air covers a much wider area instead of directing energy down into the ground. Of course, if your target is a subterranean bunker, then they have ground penetrating bombs to take are of that. They have their own trigger mechanisms so impact with the ground doesn't have to be the trigger. They explode before they hit the ground because people either remote detonate them or set a timer that makes sure they go off that way (*why* air detonations are used has been explained by other users a bit). Separately, for a nuke to work a *very* precise series of firing mechanisms has to take place. The explosion has to start in a very specific, controlled way. If you just hit a nuclear bomb with another non-nuclear bomb to blow it up, it wouldn't go nuclear. It's not as simple as ""hit something and the reaction goes nuclear.""","{'rouge1': {'precision': 69.83, 'recall': 10.15, 'fmeasure': 17.72}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.91, 'recall': 2.01, 'fmeasure': 3.51}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.66, 'recall': 5.76, 'fmeasure': 10.07}}"
"How are ships able to maintain electricity for the entire ship, be it military or cruise line, for such extended periods of time?","Generators. Most ships use diesel generators, which are the same type of engine that power a lot of the heavy machinery on the ship. They're really just big, expensive, portable engines that produce electricity. They're not terribly efficient, but they're reliable and easy to maintain. Ships have multiple generators, so that if one fails, the others can take up the slack. They also have backup power sources, like batteries, which can be charged by the generators. The batteries are used to power things like radios and lights when the generators are off.","That have generators onboard that make electricity. So long as they have fuel they have power. I am confused as to why you think this would be an issue? The engine rooms of large ships are a lot like a power plant on land. Only small ships today have their engines connected directly to the propellers. Larger vessels instead use diesel-electric transmission. [Massive diesel engines]( URL_0 ) (you could actually stand up inside some of them) are connected to equally large electric generators. These drive powerful electric motors, which spin the propellers. These huge generators can produce more than enough electricity to power the ship's secondary systems like passenger accommodations, water filters, navigation equipment, etc. Diesel train locomotives work the exact same way, just on a much smaller scale. They act as a generator powering both the wheels and passenger cars. There are other setups too. A lot of military vessels use nuclear power. In this setup, you have a nuclear reactor boiling water that turns a steam turbine. A lot of other vessels will use gas turbines. Basically a stationary jet engine that runs on natural gas or other fuels. They all drive electric generators though. Ships docked in port can also be connected to the local power grid via huge cables, which is often cheaper than running the engines. They use electric motors because they maintain even turning power (torque) regardless of RPM. So do steam engines, but they're very large. If you've seen a cutaway of the Titanic, half the ship is just the engines and boilers. Electric motors are more compact. They can also be mounted in [swiveling pods]( URL_1 ) under the ship, which make big vessels more maneuverable. As for fresh water, it depends on the vessel. Short range ships will carry potable water in tanks. Long range ships will often have a desalination plant, which removed salt and purifies water either through evaporation or reverse osmosis filters. Nuclear ships will typically have these as well to provide fresh water to operate the steam turbines.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 65.26, 'recall': 17.97, 'fmeasure': 28.18}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.64, 'recall': 2.91, 'fmeasure': 4.57}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.58, 'recall': 8.7, 'fmeasure': 13.64}}"
What is a monolithic structure in operating systems?,"A monolithic structure is a single, unified program that manages all of the computer's resources. It's the opposite of a microkernel, which is a kernel with a small core that only manages the hardware and provides services to programs, while the programs themselves run as separate processes. The monolithic kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It manages all of the computer's hardware, controls the flow of data between programs, and provides services such as file management, memory management, and network management. The monolithic kernel is responsible for allocating resources, managing memory, and controlling access to files and hardware devices. The operating system is a collection of programs that provide services to programs. The kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the computer hardware and provides services to programs.

The kernel is responsible for controlling access to files and hardware devices.  ","In software, a monolith is a single program which performs a large number of tasks, but is still a single binary. The alternative to a monolith is to break the large program up into several smaller programs, each of which has a more narrow list of responsibilities. The alternative to a monolith is called (especially if you like buzzwords) something like ""Service Oriented Architecture"" or ""Microservices"". Monolith: One big program which performs a number of tasks Microservices: Many little programs, each of which only does one thing Operating systems are just programs, although they have a very specific set of responsibilities and are treated specially by the system. Some of these responsibilities are things like memory management, process management, thread management, disk management, device drivers, event handling and routing, I/O processing, interrupt processing, security and access, etc. Despite the fact that something like ""Process management"" is a pretty different beast from ""I/O processing"", these two things are still compiled into a single Kernel binary. In a monolith, if you need to update one of these, you have to update the whole shebang. This is a monolith. The alternative to a monolith would be to break all the different responsibilities into their own binaries, and those would communicate over some kind of messaging channel. This is called a ""Microkernel"" approach. Microkernel seems nice because each individual service can be smaller, simpler, and able to be managed/updated independently. The problem comes because the messaging channel which allows these services to communicate starts to become very complicated: handling enough bandwidth, keeping messages properly ordered, serializing and deserializing, keeping message contract versions in sync between services, etc. And then there are all the complexities where you have to keep track of which order the services are initialized in during boot-up, and all the million possible scenarios of what the system should do if one of the services crashes while the other ones are still healthy, etc. Linux, BSD and Android are pure monoliths. Windows basically uses ""hybrid"" approach with three basic parts: HAL, ""the microkernel"" and ""the executive"", where ""the microkernel"" is basically a normal monolithic kernel, and ""the executive"" contains several services which operate in kernel mode. Darwin (iOS, OSX) also uses a hybrid approach, though it's harder to describe. There's a kernel called ""Mach"", but there are components borrowed from FreeBSD like I/O and POSIX, and there are also a number of microkernel-like services though many of them run in user-space to avoid context-switches. The only ""real"" microkernel system I can think of for modern OS's is GNU Hurd, which has been under development for nearly 30 years and STILL isn't ready for reliable wide-spread use because of the inherent complexities of the approach. Symbian was a microkernel, but a lot of complexity there disappeared because symbian ran on single-core phones, and Symbian isn't really a thing anymore with the advent of iOS and Android. A monolithic structure means the kernel (all OS's have them) are set up so that the kernel does everything. This was the way it was first done in Linux - back when you had to compile your own kernel if you wanted support for sound (for example). As kernels got more sophisticated, they became too large to go with the ""one size fits all"" things, so they evolved to use modules, that could be added in whenever needed, and to accomodate more complex and sophisticated hardware. Nowadays, I don't know what Windows uses, but as for MacOS, I'm pretty sure they use a monolithic kernel, since the hardware is pretty narrowly defined. Linux used modules, but I'm not sure about Android or iOS. Soneone else could give a better better idea about these things.

what is ‘proof-of-work’ and ‘proof-of-stake’ and what is the difference,"The general idea of proof-of-work is that the blockchain has a set of rules that must be followed, and a ""proof"" is required to show that the rules have been followed. This is done by a computer solving a mathematical puzzle. If the puzzle is solved correctly, then the computer is rewarded with some new coins. The idea of proof-of-stake is similar, but instead of a computer solving a puzzle, the proof is determined by the amount of money that the computer has invested in the system. The more money invested, the more likely it is that the proof will be accepted. This is why proof-of-stake is also called ""proof-of-wealth"".","Proof of work: I trust this because it was ""carved in stone"" and accepted by the community. The work involved in crafting it makes it near impossible to tamper with it. Proof of stake: I trust this because it was created by, and signed by people who have a a personal stake in it. ""proof of work"" is how bitcoin transactions are secured: basically they are recorded in blocks that are ""signed"" with a number that is very hard to find, so you know that statistically, a lot of computing power was spent on finding one, and someone trying to use their computing power to maliciously manipulate the transactions will be foiled when the next block is signed by someone else who did not include the manipulated transactions. The manipulator can only win in the long run if they control more computing power than everyone else together. The downside is that the ""work"" is basically wasted electricity - by now a pretty large amount being constantly wasted, and it has to keep increasing with the total value of Bitcoin. It is inefficient by design, unless you change the design to make the work something useful, but that complicates everything a lot (there are such designs, e.g. to have miners do protein folding simulations which helps with medical research). The solution to this problem is ""proof of stake"" where people pledge some of the currency they have to be allowed to confirm transaction blocks.

How Do jet engines work and what’s the benefits of using them over a standard internal combustion or Wankel engine? Is it possible to use a jet engine in a car?,"n the 1930s, the British inventor Frank Whittle was trying to figure out how to make a more powerful aircraft engine. He was working on a turbine engine, which uses a spinning turbine wheel to generate power, but he was having trouble with the heat. He needed something to cool the engine, and he found that by using a jet engine, he could. In a jet engine, fuel is burned inside a combustion chamber, and the hot gases are then blown through a nozzle to create thrust. But in order to do this, the engine had to be able to withstand the heat. In order to cool the engine, Whittle needed to blow the hot air out of the engine and into the atmosphere. The hot air is then cooled by the cold air outside, and the cold air is then blown back into the engine. This is how a jet engine works, and it’s the same principle that makes a jet airplane fly. The only difference is that a jet engine is much bigger than a car engine, so it’s much heavier. But it’s also much more powerful, so it’s worth it. A jet engine is basically a turbine engine, where the turbine engine spins really fast and generates power.  ","Jet engines are faster, they output more thrust. Both operate by reacting gases to make an explosion. the jet engine uses that explosion itself to push forward, while a standard engine/wankel engine uses the explosion to spin a wheel. propeller planes and almost all cars just spin wheels because the materials are easier to get (cheaper), the control is better, and they don't use as much fuel. Jet engines are faster. you can put a jet engine in a car (thats how the land speed record was set). Its just hard to control and unsafe to drive on normal roads. Jets take in air, compress it, add fuel to it, light it, and shoot the heated gassed out the rear. Benefits? A jet turbine can be built to be immensely more powerful that a standard internal combustion engine. They can work at much higher altitudes than standard reciprocating engines (you won’t find a prop powered plane at 50kft). And sure, you can put a jet turbine in a car. It’d be serious damn loud, though. You can’t really muffle a turbine without performance impacts. Plus, I wouldn’t want to be sitting behind a turbine powered car when the light turns green.

How do Lego bricks not lose tension/force through repetitive play?,"They do. But it's a really low amount, and it doesn't take long to get used to it.

Where did anchors get their shape?,   shape of anchors can be traced back to the first anchors that were used in ancient Greece and Rome.  se early anchors were made from a single piece of iron that was shaped to form a loop.   loop was then attached to a length of chain that was used to lower the anchor into the water.   loop was the shape of a ring.   early anchors were used to secure ships to a fixed point on the seafloor.   anchor would be lowered into the water and then attached to the seafloor.   ship would then be pulled back into place by the chain.   anchor would be used to secure the ship until it was needed again. This is still how anchors are used today.   shape of anchors has evolved over time.   first anchors were made from a single piece of iron that was shaped to form a loop.   loop was then attached to a length of chain that was used to lower the anchor into the water.   loop was the shape of a ring.   early anchors were used to secure ships to a fixed point on the seafloor.   anchor would be lowered into the water and then attached to the seafloor.   ship would then be pulled back into place by the chain.   anchor would be used to secure the ship until it was needed again.

[ELI5: How do anchors work? ]( URL_2 ) ^(_7 comments_) When the ship starts to move it will drag the anchor. If you just drag a cube of steel nothing but it's weight will stop you. If you put some hooks on it then when you drag it the hooks will dig in and fight your motion more than just the weight of the anchor This is more complicated than one would think, actually. & nbsp; First off, understand that anchors are not actually what keeps the boat from moving. It's actually the cable that connects the anchor to the boat which keeps the boat or other sea vessel stationary. The cable uses the movement of the water to form a natural catenary. The catenary is the curve of a cable. This occurs because the cable is fixed to the boat and the ground so the weight of the cable causes the catenary. This curve of the cable absorbs the sudden movements of the water, such as waves, and allows the vessel to remain in place. & nbsp; Now, the catenary only works properly if it is safely secured at both ends. This is where the anchor comes into play. There are various types of anchors that are used. It all depends on the material that makes up the sea bottom. Some areas are extremely rocky and require a different anchor than if it were a soft sand. Their shapes are all different. For example, the [Mushroom Anchor]( URL_0 :) is used in a soft sea bottom for vessels that are going to be there awhile. It is designed so that it goes straight into the sea bottom and uses suction to remain. This is for more permanent mooring. The more traditional [Fisherman's Anchor]( URL_1 :) is designed so that the two flukes (points) can dig into a soft sand bottom.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 38.66, 'recall': 25.56, 'fmeasure': 30.77}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.02, 'recall': 5.29, 'fmeasure': 6.38}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.59, 'recall': 13.61, 'fmeasure': 16.39}}"
How genetic algorithms learn and how new generations are made,"In a nutshell, a genetic algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm that evolves a population of candidate solutions. In this case, the candidate solutions are represented as strings of bits (genes), and the fitness function assigns a fitness value to each string. The fittest strings are selected to reproduce, and the less fit strings are selected to mutate. The mutation process can be anything from simply flipping a bit to randomly changing a string of bits. The mutation rate is adjustable, and the algorithm can be run multiple times with different mutation rates to see what kind of results you get. The algorithm can also be run multiple times with different initial populations, and the results can be compared to see which algorithm performs better.","It's all up to the programmer. They write some arbitrary ""fitness test"" to assign a score to each member of the current generation & then breed them. Breeding, likewise, is up to the programmer. They figure out a way to represent attributes/parameters of the algorithm as numbers and then ""shuffle them up"" while possibly adding in some ""mutations"" to get variability. In this case, score is a pretty obvious fitness test & [it looks like they used a relatively simple neural network]( URL_0 ) to model behavior.

Why is it bad if firearms overheat? Why do they stop shooting?,"If you overheat the barrel, the bullet will expand and become deformed, causing it to not penetrate the target and instead bounce off. This is called ""cooking off"" and is why it's important to not fire your weapon too long. Firearms can also overheat due to poor ventilation. If the barrel and chamber are not cooling properly, the firearm will become too hot and cause the barrel to expand. This can cause the barrel to rupture, which can be fatal.","I have torture tested some guns for quality assurance. When a cartridge is fired, the gunpowder is converted to very fast moving and hot gases. The barrel (among other firing components of a firearm) ""eat up"" some of this heat from the expanding gases (you can YouTube this stuff, there are hilarious but real demonstrations of people ""cooking"" bacon on an AK-rifle barrel and such after a segment of rapid firing). When these metals get very hot, they increase their chances of deforming to stress; stress such as very fast gas expansion can ultimately break internal mechanisms and/or cause your gone to ""explode."" This is a very basic explanation, I don't do metallurgy so I can't explain the nitty-gritty of what's going on in a metallo-atomic scale. it's extremely rare for most guns to overheat to the point of malfunction. heavy machine guns are the exception to this because they fire many thousands of rounds a minute and are used in sustained fire. URL_1 URL_0 a repeating gun requires the cycle be completed to fire the next round. that cycle depends on mechanical linkages to move parts back and forth. when metal gets hot, it expands and becomes softer. once the metal gets really hot, it may not move the parts back to same position in order for the cycle to complete. obviuosly in guns that have plastic parts rather than all metal, the plastic will melt and deform before the metal parts. Metal changes shape when it's hot, and it gets soft. Bullets have a lot of energy behind them. If the barrel is too hot, the bullet could stick in the barrel, burst the barrel. The cartridge could burst in the magazine. None of this is good. Guns are made up of a bunch of metal pieces that need to slide around each other fairly closely. If pieces heat up at different rates, they'll expand differently and may have trouble sliding around in the right way. Inside a bullet is a tiny explosion that gets directed down a tube. This tends to heat up the bits involved in bits that handle those hot gasses. As long as you haven't physically damaged the weapon, this will likely just result in a round not getting pushed into place right & not firing. If you give it a second to cool off a bit, you can just reload it & you're fine. others have answered the question about guns, so I'll take the part about videogames. videogames often embellish for gameplay reasons. it would be extremely unwise to continue firing a weapon that had overheated to the point of malfunctioning, but the game isn't interested in real gun behaviors, it's a game mechanic. you have a tool that can only be used for so long. the game is challenging you to balance the use of this tool with your interest in completing your task quickly. this creates opportunities for decision making. the gun can be used a bit longer if you pay the price of not being able to use it at all for a period. when are those periods, how long are they, etc. the animation simply serves to tell the player that they can't fire and give a general sense of how long they will be paying for overusing the weapon. using a character animation as opposed to a timer helps immersion and reduces the player's mental load. Most people have gotten pretty close, but not quit hitting the nail on the head. Many (not all) fully automatic firearms work using a direct impingement or similar gas-powered mechanism for pushing the bolt back, ejecting a the spent case, and loading a new round. Generally, this is the mechanism that fails in an automatic rifle. Basically how it works is there is a ""block"" near the end of the barrel that directs some of the gasses created by the ignited gunpowder up and into a tube that directs it back to cycle the bolt. Normally either the block will get so hot it ""melts"" or deforms and stops directing the gas the right way. Or the gas tube can do the same thing. Now, there's another mechanism. Good old fashioned blowback. It uses the gasses created by the gunpowder as well- but instead of traveling down a tube from the end of the barrel, it's designed so the bolt is quite literally blown back by the expanding gas in the actual chamber. So for this design, everyone else has already explained it. Usually a barrel can ""droop"" from getting so hot the metal is malleable, or other miscellaneous parts can be malformed or break from getting hot. As for how it's done in a video game- well, it's a video game. To be honest they're never very accurate about firearms. But if it were always 100 percent accurate it wouldn't be fun right?","{'rouge1': {'precision': 70.37, 'recall': 6.81, 'fmeasure': 12.42}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.5, 'recall': 1.67, 'fmeasure': 3.06}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 41.98, 'recall': 4.06, 'fmeasure': 7.41}}"
What is AC grounding as opposed to DC grounding?,"AC grounding is when the grounding wire is connected to a neutral point in the system. DC grounding is when the grounding wire is connected to the negative terminal of the power source. In a typical house, you have 120 volts of AC power, so the grounding wire is connected to the neutral of the circuit. The neutral is usually connected to the grounding wire through a grounding rod. In the case of DC power, the grounding wire is connected to the negative terminal of the power source. In the case of a solar panel, the grounding wire is connected to the negative terminal of the panel.","They aren't any different. In both cases you're just establishing a common point to reference voltages against For AC your signal will vary between above and below ground regularly. For DC your signal will either be above or below ground and stay there Unlike a typical household protective earth ground (AC), in a DC circuit, the ""ground"" is often somewhat of a misapplied but extremely common term for what's a reference point in the circuit. You'll notice your multimeter usually says COM where plugging in one of the probes; that's what it's for. Voltage is measured as a *difference* in potential, so you need a 0 to base it from. This is that reference point, and everything else measured-from and returning-to there in the end. It gets more complicated with AC/DC coupling setups where noise is an issue; in this case AC grounds refer to grounds with a capacitor which blocks the DC signals. For AC, you are actually connecting to an earth ground through a cable or rod. For most low volt DC, you just connect to a reference ground. Think negative battery terminal in a car. In both cases you are just completing the circuit, so current can flow. Electricity = angry pixies that want to go home. AC = angry pixies who want to get back in to the earth (home) we are using the neutral that is bonded, connected, to the earth to get them there. DC= angry pixies want to get back to the negative terminal (home). Some people say the pixies go from negative to positive but we will ignore them for now. Some times you will have a DC power supply that has the negative terminal bonded to the earth, this is for safety. In both AC and DC you ground the system to provide a path home for the pixies and that path should be a Low resistance path so it is easier for the protection, fuse/breaker, to trip and stop the pixies.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 59.81, 'recall': 18.88, 'fmeasure': 28.7}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 21.7, 'recall': 6.8, 'fmeasure': 10.36}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 37.38, 'recall': 11.8, 'fmeasure': 17.94}}"
How are magnets in the road used to regulate traffic lights?,"They detect the cars coming through, and the traffic light changes accordingly. There are sensors at the bottom of the traffic lights that detect cars passing through. The sensors are usually made of a magnetic material, and the cars are equipped with magnets that interact with the sensors. The sensors detect the strength of the magnetic field, and if the field is strong enough to detect a car, the light changes to red. If the field is weak enough, the light changes to green. The sensors can also detect the speed of the cars, and the traffic light can change to yellow if the car is going too fast to stop in time.","Traffic light sensors, at least historically, are specialized metal detectors embedded underneath the road. They don't use magnets specifically, but they detect how the presence of metal in a car above it alters the electromagnetic properties of the space around the coil. However, most municipalities are moving away from these kind of sensors though, in favor of miniature radar based sensors that mount to the signal post itself. Under-road type sensors are extremely expensive to fix when they do fail, as this usually requires tearing up the road for at least 24 hours (and thereby obstructing traffic.) Having a small radar sensor that mounts above ground, which you can replace in 20 minutes with a cherry-picker? This is a no-brainer. The system was first used in Australia. The Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System, abbreviated SCATS, is an intelligent transportation system that manages the dynamic (on-line, real-time) timing of signal phases at traffic signals, meaning that it tries to find the best phasing (i.e. cycle times, phase splits and offsets) for a traffic situation (for individual intersections as well as for the whole network). SCATS is based on the automatic plan selection from a library in response to the data derived from loop detectors or other road traffic sensors. SCATS uses sensors at each traffic signal to detect vehicle presence in each lane and pedestrians waiting to cross at the local site. The vehicle sensors are generally inductiveloops installed within the road pavement. The pedestrian sensors are usually push buttons. Various other types of sensors can be used for vehicle presence detection, provided that a similar and consistent output is achieved. Information collected from the vehicle sensors allows SCATS to calculate and adapt the timing of traffic signals in the network. SCATS is installed at about 42,000 intersections in over 154 cities in 25 countries. In Australia, where the system was first developed, the majority of signalised intersections are SCATS operated (around 11,000).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.75, 'recall': 19.03, 'fmeasure': 28.38}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.93, 'recall': 3.03, 'fmeasure': 4.52}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.63, 'recall': 11.48, 'fmeasure': 17.12}}"

When the valve opens, the water in the tank flows into the bowl and flushes it. Another way is that the toilet has a pressure sensor that measures the water pressure in the tank.

Difference between single phase and three phase electricity,"In single phase power, there is a single AC current waveform that flows through the power line. This is the most common type of power distribution and is used for most residential and commercial power. In three phase power, there are three AC current waveforms that flow through the power line. The waveforms are spaced 120 degrees apart and the total current flowing through the line is the sum of the three waveforms. Three phase power is used in industrial and commercial applications where a high power load is required, such as large motors, pumps, and air conditioners. The advantages of three phase power are: * Higher power density. The total power output of a three phase system is higher than a single phase system with the same amount of power input. * Lower power losses. The total power output of a three phase system is higher than a single phase system with the same amount of power input. * Smaller size. The total size of a three phase system is smaller than a single phase system with the same amount of power output. * Higher efficiency. Three phase systems are more efficient than single phase systems, which means that they produce less heat and lower power losses. * Lower starting currents. The starting currents of three phase motors are lower than single phase motors.  ","AC electricity has waves of voltage. Essentially the electricity arrives at the destination alternating in peaks of high voltage and peaks of low (or negative) voltage. [Here]( URL_0 ) is what it looks like. Now normally there is one peak and one trough in your flow. In three phase power you actually have three different waveforms in one stream. [This]( URL_1 ) is what it looks like. Three phase power is advantageous in that if you take the sum of the power of all three phases at any time, it is always the same value.

Do planes have speed limits?,"A plane in level flight is flying at the same altitude as the horizon. A plane in vertical flight is flying up or down. Most of the time it is flying up. Planes in level flight are usually cruising at a constant altitude, but planes in vertical flight are either climbing or descending.","Planes are not allowed to fly at the speed of sound over land (at least in the US). It causes an unpleasant sonic boom. If you mean to ask whether airspace has speed limits that aircraft must adhere to, yes! It varies by region, and can be a bit complex, but typically airplanes have to slow down the lower they are flying. For instance, in Canadian Aviation Regulations 602.32(reference number if you want to look online!) Specify that below 10,000 feet speed shall be not above 250 knots, below 3,000 feet no faster than 200 kts... but it depends where you are and how busy it is. In reality commercial aircraft sometimes exceed those speeds and it is rarely reported or punished in areas with low traffic volume and low oversight. Types of speed limits for airplanes in the U.S. * No faster than the speed of sound over or near land * No faster than 250 knots (about 300mph) below 10,000 * Certain types of airspace have a 200 knot limit * Certain departure/arrival procedures have a published limit saying ""cross XXX position at XXX sped"" * Air traffic control can assign specific speeds example: ""snoo 1234 maintain 300 knots"" Physical limits: * vNE/vMO: Never exceed or max operating speed, the speed at which physical damage may occur to the aircraft * mMO: Similar to the above but measured in % of the speed of sound. Usually mMO limit exists to prevent some of the effects encountered when flying near the speed of sound (mach tuck, buffett) * vFE/LE/Whatever: Similar in nature to vNE but lower due to a specific situation like having the flaps out. These can vary depending on the type of plane you're flying, for example my current airplane has a limit saying that you can't exceed 160 knots with the window open.

If you were to hover between them, it might cause an arc. There was a lot of testing done to determine how close is too close for electrical safety. If you look closely at a picture of a glass insulator like they use on the towers, you'll see that it's designed to have both a long surface area between one end and another, plus the bell shape helps ensure it's hard for rain to reach or remain on the inside surfaces. Power companies also wash the insulators as part of regular maintenance, using boom trucks that spray deionized water that's a very poor conductor. By keeping the insulators clean, when rain hits them it doesn't become a good conductor and voltage leaks are minimal. Power System Engineer here: Insulators are used to keep circuits separated.

Here is what an insulator looks like URL_0 Isn't fresh water not really that conductive? While salt water is. EDIT wording - rain is still conductive, just less so than you might think. Question for you guys who know electricity: There's a path my wife and I have hiked a couple times that goes under some high voltage transmission lines. Both times we went under them they were making a sound like a steak sizzling. Why is that? (The first time we heard it we were like, uh, do we really wanna walk under that?) A rough rule of thumb is that air will insulate about 1000 volts per millimeter.. Or 10k volts per centimeter. That means that on the highest 330kv lines, you only need the cables to be at least 33 cm apart.. And they make sure that the earth cable (usually the single cable) is the closest cable...and that other cables are at least a meter away. Next, when the cables pass a transmission tower, the insulator that holds the cable up is at least a meter long... And there's a cable that jumps the join, so the path of least resistance is always away from the tower. Next, the single most common mode of failure for hv lines is that they oscillate when struck by strong gusts of wind.. ^1 Which is why cables in exposed areas are either bundles of cables separated by plastic spacers, or have large plastic ""football's""on them to stop resonant vibrations. ^1 The cables on one side ""skip"" one way, and the cables on the other in the opposite direction, and in some cases get close enough to touch... So you make sure they are under enough tension they don't touch, or don't oscillate. The next most common reason for hv line failure is either joint failure.. The cables have to be joined at some point, and the joins fail because the cable is flexible. You can spot the fault with a thermal camera, and the fix is simple. (Cut, weld)... Or bird damage. Big Bird lands on cable, stretches wing, gets close enough to next cable for the voltage to jump.. And the arc runs away. Just to add, we go into the 138kv switchyard in the rain sometimes to open up gas circuit breakers and isolate the buss from the grid in the pouring rain. It's actually not an issue to be around high voltage to certain distances. They sometimes make insulators out of a special rubber that is hydrophobic which means the water beads and runs off. In areas where pollution is higher - such as near the sea or near mines or bush fires area - they increase the distance across the surface of the insulator with a wider insulator or ribs to more surface on the underside. Heavy rain isn’t as much of a risk as any salt/pollutants/ash that might conduct will wash off with the rain. Fog is a bigger risk where the insulators are just wet enough to dissolve the pollution or salt on the insulators make a conductive path. Pure water is a very good insulator. Rain water directly from the sky is pretty close to pure. Even fresh water (rivers/lakes) isn't all that as a conductor of electricity. So the issue doesn't come up as often you'd think. Not even at modest voltages (e.g. 120 AC line voltage or even at 100s to 1000s of voltage). To be a good conductor you need ""ions"" from dissolved salts. So salt water conducts better. As others have said - given ENOUGH voltage (""electrical pressure""), even a shitty conductor will start to conduct. But then the trick is distance: the amount of conduction (aka ""current flow"") depends on distance (R = 𝜌 d/A, I = V/R, increasing d increases R which decreases I).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.66, 'recall': 8.72, 'fmeasure': 15.24}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.26, 'recall': 1.18, 'fmeasure': 2.06}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.97, 'recall': 4.59, 'fmeasure': 8.03}}"
How does military camouflage work?,"It's not camouflage in the classical sense, but it's a way to disguise the vehicle in a way that makes it hard to identify it as a military vehicle. It does this by making it look like a civilian vehicle, so it blends in with the surroundings. It's not very effective, but it's a cheap and easy way to make it harder to identify a vehicle. The paint is designed to be a darker, more muted color than what you'd typically see on a military vehicle. The paint is also designed to be more reflective, so it blends in with the surrounding environment better. The vehicle's shape is also designed to be more like a civilian vehicle. The wheels are designed to be more like a civilian vehicle, so they're less noticeable. The vehicle's shape is also designed to be less noticeable. It's not a very good camouflage, but it's a cheap and easy way to make a military vehicle harder to identify. The paint job is designed to make it look like a civilian vehicle, and the shape of the vehicle is designed to make it look like a civilian vehicle.","Camouflage patterns don't actually make you invisible, it just makes it harder for someone to spot you. My 7th grade bio teacher had a great demonstration to explain camouflage in nature, you can try it yourself if you have different colored construction paper. Everyone gathered around their black table/desk top. Scattered around the surface were tiny squares of paper cut up, all a variety of colors. Red, blue, black, white, yellow, purple, etc. All the students were told to pick up as many of the squares as they could in 30 seconds, but you could only pick up one square at a time and then put it into a cup. By the end of the thirty seconds, there were almost as many black squares as there were when we started, a lot of dark purple squares, and almost no white or yellow squares, because the darker colors matched the black table top. That's how camouflage works (and how natural selection gives lots of animals natural camouflage). The reason for this is that eyes are very good at spotting changes, things that are different from the world around it, but are more likely to skim over things that are blending in with their background, like black paper on a black table or camouflaged snipers in the bushes. Military camouflage has similar colors to the leaves/dirt of the territory the wearer is working in, and it's arranged in round-ish blotches because it more closely matches the patterns of the leaves around the wearer. Because the clothes (and sometimes face paint) blends in with the area, it's much easier for someone looking in the direction of a sniper or hunter to miss them entirely, their eyes passing over the clothes without seeing a change from the environment. tl;dr: Eyes are good at noticing change, and when camouflage matches the area around it, it blends in, so eyes are more likely to skim over it and not notice. Mostly it works to disturb the human outline. We're very good at spotting humans and human-ish shapes. Have you ever seen a person in the dark but there wasn't actually anything there? That's your brain constantly searching for the shapes, proportions, and other features that mark ""human"" to you. Camo works by messing with those shapes and adopting the coloring of the plants you're trying to blend with. Like [this]( URL_1 ) or [this]( URL_3 ). If you wear the appropriate suit that messes with the patterns that mean ""human"" to your brain, the brain won't register the shape as human.

why is it bad for planes to have a full tank of fuel?," PSA: I'm not a pilot, but I've asked the question before and gotten some good answers. The short answer is that it's bad because it reduces the amount of fuel available for takeoff. For a typical passenger jet, the weight of the fuel is a significant portion of the overall weight of the plane. A full tank of fuel means that the plane is less able to take off, because it has less weight to lift. This means that it needs to use more thrust to lift off the ground, which is bad for several reasons. First, it means that the plane will need to burn more fuel to take off, which is bad for the environment. Second, it means that the plane will have to produce more thrust, which is bad for the engines. Third, it means that the plane will have to be heavier, which is bad for the plane's overall fuel efficiency. The weight of the fuel is one of the major factors in determining how much fuel a plane will use in flight. A plane that is heavier will use more fuel to fly, because it has to lift that weight. If the plane has to lift a full tank of fuel, it will need to burn more fuel to take off than if it had to lift less fuel. This means that the plane will burn more fuel during flight, which is bad for the environment.  ","Aircraft have different maximum take-off weight and maximum landing weight. The forces on a aircraft is higher when you land compared to when you take off. It is quite obvious when you are take a flight. A takeoff are smooth but there is/can be a significant bump when you hit the ground and land. For a Airbus A 380 the maximum take-off weight is 575t and the maximum landing weight is 394t or 68% of the take off weight. and it can load 323,545 L ~300 t of fuel so a significant part of the withe of the plane when fully loaded is fuel In normal operation this is not a problem because the plane used fuel during its flight and you have the minimum amount of fule that you need to travel to the destination + a bit extra for diversions or other emergency. The result is that the plane when landing on a normal flight is as light as possible. You what to minimize weight because that will reduce fule usage. So if a aircraft have to do a unscheduled landing for a emergency it might need to dump fuel into the air so it can land in a safe way. I would guess that the aircraft you was incorrectly fule a mistake or fueled for a different destination that changed. So the alternative was to pump it out or fly in a less fuel efficient way so the weight of the plane is below the maximum landing weight when you land at the destination Was it a short flight? Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is higher than maximum landing weight (MLW). On a long flight, the plane will always burn enough fuel to be below MLW, even if it starts with a maximum fuel load. On a short flight, that isn’t always true. Say you have a plane going from NYC to London. It’s fuelled to near capacity. Some issue arises shortly after takeoff that means that the plane cannot continue across the Atlantic Ocean. If the issue is urgent enough, you can land right away, above MLW. But the plane will have to be thoroughly inspected as it may be damaged. If you can stay in the air and dump fuel or just circle to burn it (some planes don’t have dump valves) till the plane crosses under the MLW threshold, that is preferable. What I am speculating happened with your flight is that it was a short one and was overfuelled. With a normal course, the plane would arrive at its destination over the MLW and that is no good. Dumping fuel is an emergency measure, worse for the environment than burning it, and not possible on all planes. So instead the pilot purposefully flies a less efficient (lower) route so that more fuel is burned in flight and by the time it arrives at the destination airport, it is light enough to land without risking structural damage. You probably also made better time than scheduled. Cruise speed is a balance of fuel burnt and time spent. If you have to waste fuel, you might as well use it to go as fast as possible. Fuel is heavy. Commercial planes can have higher maximum take-of weights than their maximum landing weights. Your plane can weigh a lot more when it starts then when it lands. This usually makes sense because you burn fuel and it gets lighter during the flight. However when you need to land before you thought you would or started with more fuel than needed for some reason you have a problem. Normally it makes sense to fly with as little fuel as needed because fuel is expensive and even just carry around fuel that you don't use ends up wasting fuel to transport the extra mass. In an emergency situation there is also the added consideration that you don't want to crash with giant tin can fuel of highly flammable fuel.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 68.98, 'recall': 25.3, 'fmeasure': 37.02}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 24.18, 'recall': 8.85, 'fmeasure': 12.95}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.69, 'recall': 12.72, 'fmeasure': 18.62}}"

Since it's small and thin piece of metal it can do this rapidly and relatively fast. Thank clicking sound was metal bending back and forth.

"Why do Ford trucks have manual hubs, but nobody else's do?"," Sounds like a great question! There are a couple reasons why Ford trucks have manual hubs, but they are not unique to Ford. In fact, most trucks have manual hubs, and they are typically preferred over automatic hubs. The main reason for this is that manual hubs are more efficient. They allow the wheels to turn freely, which means that they are able to maintain better traction on the road. In addition, manual hubs are more durable and less prone to failure than automatic hubs. They also tend to be more cost effective, which is why they are used in most trucks. However, the main reason why Ford trucks have manual hubs is because they are a part of their heritage. Ford has a long history of manufacturing trucks, and manual hubs have been used in most of them for many years. This is why they are still used in modern trucks like the Ford F-150. In fact, the F-150 is one of the only trucks on the market that still uses manual hubs. So, while other truck manufacturers may use automatic hubs, Ford has stuck with the traditional manual hubs that have been used in their trucks for decades. The reason for this is because they are better, and because they are a part of their heritage.","The reason why the 'super duty' ford trucks have manually locking hubs is by design....for a vacuum actuated hub to work, the wheel needs to spin min 3/4 of a turn. SuperDuty trucks are 'work trucks' so they are often off road, plowing snow etc...if you were in 2WD and got stuck in a vacuum actuated system it would be near impossible to have those hubs lock in if they truck cant move. Ford recognized this and put the manual locking hubs on all trucks (except the F150). Plus, if you had a vaccuum acuated system and that vaccuum fails then what? manual locking hubs wont fail like an accutated system. I am not an expert. But it looks like auto locking hubs is a vacuum actuated addon feature and not standard package. So if you bought a base model...then that explains that. Also seems even with the auto feature in the console, the manual lock is still retained if you need to. And since auto lock requires the wheel to spin before locking, manual override may be needed if you're binded stuck. Or yet auto vacuum system is damaged.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 34.09, 'recall': 38.46, 'fmeasure': 36.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.2, 'recall': 3.61, 'fmeasure': 3.39}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.45, 'recall': 17.44, 'fmeasure': 16.39}}"

Why can’t small models be scaled up directly?,"You can't directly scale up small models because the relationships between different parts of the model are not the same as they are in the real world. For example, if you make a model of a car, the size of the model is fixed by the size of the parts used to make it. If you make a model of a car out of Lego bricks, the size of the model is limited by the size of the bricks. If you make a model of a car out of a material that has a certain strength, the size of the model is limited by the strength of the material. If you make a model of a car out of a material that has a certain weight, the size of the model is limited by the weight of the material. If you make a model of a car out of a material that has a certain shape, the size of the model is limited by the shape of the material. If you make a model of a car out of a material that has a certain texture, the size of the model is limited by the texture of the material. If you make a model of a car out of a material that has a certain color, the size of the model is limited by the color of the material.  ","[The square cube law.]( URL_0 ) When you double the scale, all surfaces are multiplied by 4 and all volumes by 8. Strength is proportional to the surface, mass is proportional to the volume. This means that when you scale something up, your strength to weight ratio (and also heat to cooling) goes down dramatically. 5yo answer: Imagine you build small sandcastle. It's made of sand grains and water that bonds them together. Now build same looking castle with same sand grains and water but 10 times bigger. You will notice that walls start to break easily. This is because much stronger forces (sand weight) affect your construction but you still use water of same bonding power. Lets try use glue instead of water and your construction will be much stronger. Let's go to different scale. Sand grains become atoms and water/glue becomes chemical bonding. Many material properties like durability or elasticity change with scale because forces goes up or down but bonding stays the same. Explosion that pushes bullet out of a barrel need to be bigger when scaling up and forces it produce may be too big for bonding of metal you use. Everything may explode into pieces instead od pushing bullet out.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 18.7, 'recall': 20.67, 'fmeasure': 19.63}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.31, 'recall': 1.45, 'fmeasure': 1.38}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 11.3, 'recall': 12.5, 'fmeasure': 11.87}}"
Why should a car engine be left to idle for a few moments after starting?,"It's a safety feature. If the car is left off for a long time, the engine will eventually stall. If the engine stalls in a car, it can cause the airbag to deploy. The airbag will be useless if the engine is stalled, so the car is designed to prevent this from happening. If the engine is left idling, the car will start up again when you turn the key. If the engine is turned off, the car will not start up again.","For the most part you don't need to, in reality on a modern engine the oil pump is pumping the oil where it needs to be within a couple of seconds, and the oils required by the engine are selected such that they work properly in your engine when cold (that's why there are two numbers in your engine oil spec, 5W-30 means it's a 5 when cold and 30 when warm, so the engine designer would design it to run ok at 5. You shouldn't run your engine hard when cold because things are not the optimal size and it doesn't lubricate optimally. But idling your car for a minute isn't going to get the oil meaningfully warm, you really need like 5-10minutes of actual driving to get there. But if you're planning on racing, yes, you could drive a few miles before you actually start racing. All the comments are one sided here, and only focused on oil. Your engine has multiple moving parts that are made from different materials, each of these materials expand and contract at different rates as the temperature changes. The tolerances( gaps between these moving parts) are precision machined to be the correct size at the engines operating temp. Oil plays a roll, but as a mechanic (in Minnesota)I've have rarely been concerned about oil as the reason to warm it up. I'm concerned about aluminum pistons slapping an iron block at 10° or below. TL:DR It's good for your engine to idle at least 10 seconds before driving off after a cold start. More than a minute or two is unnecessary. Other comments seem to be based on letting it idle *minutes* instead of *moments*. I define a few moments as anywhere from 10 seconds to 1 minute. Most everybody has been correct about one thing or another. Modern oils are very good. A 0w20 used in most cars nowadays has a ""winter"" or cold viscosity (how quicky or slowly it flows) rating of 0, and a hot viscosity rating of 20. Oils did not use to be so good, which is where the 3k miles or 3 months change schedule came from. You changed oil viscosity with the seasonal change in temperature. Manufacturers use and recommend oils with a range of viscosity because the vehicles will be used in a very large variety of temperatures, and have learned how to build engines that can better tolerate them. Race cars usually use a single viscosity oil that performs really well at high temperatures, and let their engines warm up fully before use. More manufacturers are going to Direct Injection fuel systems, where the fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber, when older cars injected fuel into the intake manifold where it was then drawn into the combustion chamber. These new engines tend to not run as well when cold, as the fuel soaks up heat when it is injected. My Focus stumbles a little if it's freezing outside and I drive off right away. If I idle for about a minute it's fine. When the parts in the engine heat up they expand and fit together tighter. If you drive aggressively before they do, they can wear out faster from the excessive movement. This is not something that will happen right away, but over years. With modern vehicles the electronics will likely crap out before the engine, unless you are *ruthless* to your car. Example, there was a guy I worked with who had a Camaro. He would be in gear and moving before the starter was disengaged, even if it was 5 degrees F. That is *horrible* for the moving parts. Letting your engine idle longer than 2 or 3 minutes is just a waste of fuel; engines actually warm up better when driven gently for a few minutes. It creates more heat than idling but doesn't create excessive wear. The higher the RPM the more wear. Modern cars don't need as long of a wait as you'd think. 90 seconds is almost always more than enough except for really extreme environments. If you start your engine then check your mirrors and fasten your seat belt, adjust the radio, and put it into gear, it's ready when you are. [This guy]( URL_0 ) goes into a very high level of detail about oil. There's a bunch of car related stuff there that can get you lost for hours. Most of waiting after starting is so things get flowing, but there's more than just wear on parts that aren't slicked up yet. Until the cylinders are lubricated fully, some of the exhaust gas can slip past the piston rings into the crankcase. This is called blow-by. This exhaust is colder than it should be, so the burn isn't as clean as it could be, and full of water vapor. The vapor mixes with the nitrogen compounds in a dirty burn to form nitric acid, which gets into the oil. Normally, this happens to a small degree anyway, and there's additives in the oil to help neutralize the acids so they do no harm. But romping on the throttle right when the car stats dumps a LOT more acid-forming gasses into the crankcase, shortening the oil life greatly. There's also the soot that forms and gets into the oil, and other crud that forms, all of this leads to why oil that's used looks and feels the way it does: it's runny and gritty. Runny means it can't stick where it should, so it doesn't lubricate as well, then the grit and crud in it makes for even worse lubrication, it's like liquid sandpaper! Running on oil that's like this just chews up your engine. Another benefit to the short idle is you can hear your engine at rest, and make sure it's not making strange noises before you put it to task. Stopping the engine just as it makes a strange sound can save you a lot of money in repair bills.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 71.43, 'recall': 5.79, 'fmeasure': 10.71}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.87, 'recall': 1.35, 'fmeasure': 2.5}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 46.43, 'recall': 3.76, 'fmeasure': 6.96}}"

It actually *could* if they designed it that way, but it wouldn't be as safe, would waste a LOT Of energy as heat, and there is absolutely no reason to do it like that. But what it can do is siphon some of that power off in the form of electromagnetic waves, re-convert those into electricity, and use that to power the circuit. We do this with a component called a transformer. And the larger the transformer is, the more current it's capable of siphoning off of the 120volt AC power. A transformer is made up of 2 or more electric coils, and something like a ferrite magnet. Energy in the primary coil, from the wall, is converted into electromagnetic energy just like an electromagnet made by wrapping wire around a pencil and using it to pick up paper clips. This electromagnetic energy then flows into the second coil where it is converted back into electricity much like the coil in a generator converting magnetic flux back into electricity, except there are no moving parts. Another way to think of it is like connecting an electric motor, to an electric generator, except instead of spinning a motor shaft, it spins magnetic fields. the thicker the windings of metal coils in the transformer are, the more power it can send to the secondary coil. This thicker coil means a larger transformer which means a larger component. In a small phone charger, the coil is tiny and easily concealable and capable of sending a few hundred mah of power. The larger transformers in a laptop power supply are capable of sending thousands of mah of power, but they are necessarily larger.

How can concrete support the weight of an entire building yet it is still possible to break it apart with nothing more than a hammer?,"Concrete is a composite material made of cement, water, and aggregate. The cement holds everything together. When you hit concrete with a hammer, you are hitting the cement. The cement is the glue. If you hit the cement hard enough, it will break.","A swinging hammer has more force in psi than a building at rest. Also, there are a lot stronger types of concrete than your typical cinderblock that you may be imagining. Concrete’s strength lies in compression strength. You can pour concrete and set an very large amount of weight on it without failure. Any other kind of force directional (lateral, vertical, or torsion) and concrete fails very quickly. Hitting the side of a concrete column Is not compression force. Concrete is extremely strong in compression, but weak in tension and especially weak in shear stress. Moreover it has poor elasticity, that is, the ability to absorb forces by compressing or stretching temporarily like a spring or rubber band. That means even slight deformations will cause extreme buildup of forces in the material. If shear forces exceed a certain level, the concrete can't absorb excess energy by denting or crumpling, and the energy can only be absorbed by fracturing. You'll notice that glancing, angled blows with a hammer are most likely to cause chips/ cracks. This is due to shear failure. Note that hardened steel is much stronger in shear and in tension than concrete is. You wouldn't want the cables of a suspension bridge made out of concrete for example. Many materials have a tradeoff between hardness and brittleness. A diamond is much harder than steel, but you can crush one with a hammer (**trust me, don't actually do this**). Concrete is a huge range of materials, it's not just one thing. Building concrete is flexible enough that an Earthquake won't cause a collapse but it's still hard enough that you can shatter little pieces off with a hammer. Concrete is about 10% as strong in tension as compression. If you swing a hammer hard and fast you can generate a force of like up to 10,000 Newtons... which is a force of like 2,250lbs(f).

Why do products that claim to block radio frequencies from cell phones actually increase your exposure to radio frequencies?,"The radio frequencies are emitted by the phone. The other products you're referring to are called shields. They're made to block the electromagnetic field of the phone. If they don't block the field, then they're not doing their job. So they're actually reducing your exposure to the field, which means you're less exposed to the radio frequencies.","There’s also [this fun video from LinusTechTips]( URL_0 ) that suggests a tin foil hat (or equivalent reflective surface) could act like a satellite dish, focusing radio waves directly into the center of your head. > Does the phone actually ""work harder"" to stay connected if there's a blocker in the way? Yes. Cell phones adjust the power of their transmitters as needed to maintain a connection. If they have a hard time being detected by the tower they will increase the energy they output so they can be heard. So if you are trying to block their output it just means they yell louder. The short and simple answer is that a cellphone will, to preserve battery, never use a transmitting power that is higher than necessary. Kind of, why the heck shout if you can whisper? If you install a blocker, you'll end up making it worse for the phone to communicate. And the obvious response from the phone is to transmit at the highest possible output in an attempt to reach through. That said, a directional shield *might work* without making the phone scream its lungs out, but that also requires that you ensure that the blocking direction is not the same direction as the cell tower. They have to work harder, as you said, because they are constantly trying to get past the blocker. However, the concern with cases that claim to do this, or *try* to do this, is that they can't cover the screen. The case can't form anything like a faraday cage (and without being grounded it doesn't do anything), AND because you hold a phone up to your head screen-forward, it may simply direct more of the energy towards your head when you're talking.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.56, 'recall': 11.71, 'fmeasure': 19.34}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.9, 'recall': 2.68, 'fmeasure': 4.44}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.75, 'recall': 6.69, 'fmeasure': 11.05}}"
"How do transformers step up voltage without essentially creating electrical energy out of nothing? Or more generally, what is the difference/relationship between voltage and power?","1. It's not true that transformers create electricity out of nothing.   electricity is still there, it's just that it's moved from one side of the transformer to the other. 2. Voltage is the potential difference between two points. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred between two points. So, if you have a 120V battery, and you connect it to a 240V circuit, then the voltage is higher, but the power is the same. 3.   relationship between voltage and power is that the voltage is the potential difference between two points, and the power is the rate at which energy is transferred between those two points. So, if you have a 120V battery, and you connect it to a 240V circuit, then the voltage is higher, but the power is the same. 4.   transformer works by creating a magnetic field in one coil, and then using that magnetic field to induce a voltage in another coil.   voltage induced in the second coil is proportional to the current flowing through the first coil. So, if the current flowing through the first coil is higher, then the voltage induced in the second coil will be higher, and the power will be the same. 5.   voltage is not ""created out of nothing"".   voltage is created by the magnetic field.

"How does using a revolving door ""save energy"" as compared to a normal door?"," tl;dr: It saves energy by slowing down the flow of people. This is the most energy-efficient way to get people in and out of a building. You don't need to use a door at all. You can just walk through the wall. It's much more efficient, but not as practical. I'll explain why it's practical in a moment. First, let's consider the energy use of a building. The biggest energy users in a building are the heating and cooling systems. The biggest energy user in a building is the heating system, followed closely by the cooling system. The heating system is used to heat the building when it's cold outside, and the cooling system is used to cool the building when it's hot outside. The heating and cooling systems use energy to heat and cool the air inside the building. This is because the air inside the building is different from the air outside the building. The air inside the building is heated or cooled, but the air outside the building is not. The heating and cooling systems are designed to heat and cool the air inside the building, even though the air outside the building is already heated or cooled. This is a waste of energy. A revolving door is designed to slow down the flow of people into and out of a building.  ","It reduces the amount warm air going out/cold air coming in. This helps reduce the cost to heat the buildings. As well as what other people have said about allowing wind to blow in and out of a building I'm sure I've read something about if a building is extensively cooled, particularly in a hot country, the air inside the building is denser than outside, so has a tendency to want to leave the doors rapidly, even to the point of preventing a normal door closing properly. Revolving doors are designed in such a way that airflow is reduced compared to normal doors, so less energy is spent trying to offset the temperature differential from cold or hot air coming in. In moderate climates where a building doesn't necessarily need to run air conditioning/heating, it can be negligible at best.

"What's the difference between winter, all-season, and normal tires?","In general, there are three different types of tires: summer, all-season, and winter. The main difference between these types of tires is how they handle different weather conditions. Winter tires are designed to handle very cold temperatures and very wet conditions, which is why they are best for driving in the winter. All-season tires are designed to handle a wide range of weather conditions, and are best for people who live in places where it rains a lot, but don't really get cold. Summer tires are designed to handle very hot temperatures and very dry conditions, and are best for people who live in places that are always warm and dry. Tires are designed for specific driving conditions. The most common are: * Winter: These tires are designed for snowy and icy roads. They are made of a softer rubber compound that grips the road better and has more tread to grab snow. * All-Season: These tires are designed for all weather conditions. They are made of a harder rubber compound that lasts longer and are designed to handle all road conditions. * Summer: These tires are designed for warm weather and dry roads. They are made of a softer rubber compound that grips the road better and has more tread to handle wet conditions.  ","summer tires: awesome in summer, disaster in winter winter tires: horrible in summer, awesomeness in winter all season tires: meh in summer.....aiiight in winter the difference is in the tread depth and design and the stiffness of the rubber. winter time is also colder than summer time, so rubber is naturall harder in cold. so winter designed tires are designed so that in cold temps, it's still able to grip the road. The difference is in the composition of the rubber and the tread pattern/design. Rubber tends to get very hard and brittle in colder temperatures, which is bad for grip. Winter tires are made of rubber that stays softer and grips better at lower temperatures compared to a normal or all season tire. The key though with winter tires is in the tread design. Winter tires have very deep treads, and lots of them, in order to dig through the snow and find grip. A tire with a shallower tread design would float on top of the snow (ask me how I know). They also have serrated [siping]( URL_1 ) that allows for much better grip on snow and ice. The rubber wears very quickly in the summer though, and the tread design means they are louder than a tire that is design to be quiet. The polar opposite of a winter tire is a summer performance tire. These often have a few shallow treads in order to maximize the amount of rubber contacting the road. And have rubber that is extra soft and grippy in warm temperatures. These are usually overkill outside of racing applications and might even be dangerous in the rain. A normal tire probably is an all season tire. It attempts to be an ""all around-er"", providing a compromise between noise, wear, and grip at all temperatures and conditions. Some do this better than others, and how ""good"" they do all of these things can vary between manufacturers or individual tire lines. Generally these are good enough to be on a car year round, but it'd be best to stay home if you expect slippery conditions in the winter.

This is why water companies use specialized equipment to monitor the flow of water on the surface. These devices are equipped with sensors that can detect changes in water flow. 2. Noise detection: Another way to detect a burst water main is by using noise detection equipment. This equipment is able to detect the noise generated by a burst pipe.

Digital Aliasing and the Nyquist Frequency,"The Nyquist frequency is the highest frequency of a signal that can be reconstructed with perfect accuracy. If a signal has a frequency higher than the Nyquist frequency, then it cannot be reconstructed accurately, and aliasing will occur. Aliasing is the distortion of a signal that results from the signal being sampled at a rate lower than the Nyquist frequency. When a signal is sampled, it is essentially a series of discrete values, each representing a particular point in time. If the signal is sampled at a rate higher than the Nyquist frequency, then each point in time is represented with perfect accuracy. However, if the signal is sampled at a rate lower than the Nyquist frequency, then each point in time is represented with a slight error. This error can build up and distort the signal, causing it to appear as if the signal contains frequencies that are not actually present. Aliasing is a problem that can be avoided by ensuring that the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency of the signal. This is known as the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem.","The real world is analog, things like sound and radio are continuous oscillations. While quantum field theory is true, most all real-life things are much, much too large to have discrete quantum behavior. When you sample something digitally, you are making a discrete measurement at a specific time and using that to represent the continuous signal. This is never correct, the real world is analog, but it's often plenty good enough. The Nyquist Frequency is all about knowing when it's good enough. Let's say you sample at 1000 samples per second. If the signal is 60 cycles/second, like wall electricity, you have each sine wave represented with 16-ish values. That's 8 for the positive side of the wave and 8 for the negative side. That will produce a very good representation. At 250 cycles per second, you're down to 2 for the positive side and 2 for the negative side. This could be 0, 1, 0, -1, ... which looks a lot more like triangles than a sine wave; or it could be .6, .6, -.6, -.6, ... which looks wrong in a different way.

The pressure would be incredibly high. You can’t do that because it would burst the pipe and cause a lot of damage. So instead you use a smaller pipe. It’s called a low pressure pipe. It’s a pipe that is designed to be used at lower pressures. It’s what’s called a “low pressure” pipe. The water pressure is not high enough close to the source because the pressure is used to push the water through the system.

You may ask, then why isn't it quite low near the end? Two reasons. 1. The pipes are fairly big, commonly 20cm or more in diameter. These carry water well, without much pressure loss per km. 2. Often the supply continues to run downhill, adding more pressure along the way. Finally! a ELI5 topic I can respond to! For a transport system involving a pump, the point of highest pressure (or head) is right at the pump outlet. We take this value, give it a safety margin (say, around 10%), and assign it as the design pressure of the entire system. So the entire line is designed to handle the highest pressure.

This crystal lattice is very strong because the SiO2 and Al2O3 molecules are bonded to each other in a very strong way.   of very small molecules that are bonded together in a very strong way.   of very small molecules that are bonded together in a very strong way.   of very small molecules that are bonded together in a very strong way.   of very small molecules that are bonded together in a very strong way.   of very small molecules that are bonded together in a very strong way.

How Dual-Clutch Transmissions and Continuously Variable Transmissions use clutches but do not stall.,"Jokes aside, I have a decent understanding of how clutches work but I'm not sure how they work in these transmissions. I know they are both continuously variable transmissions but I don't know the details. I'm just curious. Thanks in advance for the answers. Dual clutch transmission uses two clutches. One clutch is used to engage and disengage the gears in the transmission. The other clutch is used to engage and disengage the engine from the transmission. The clutches are designed to be very smooth and are only engaged and disengaged when necessary. The clutches are also designed to be very fast and to switch between gears very quickly. When the clutches are disengaged, the gears are free to move and the transmission is able to change gears very quickly. This is what allows the transmission to change gears so quickly and smoothly. The clutches are also designed to be very low friction. This is what allows the transmission to change gears so quickly and smoothly without any slipping or stalling. The clutches are also designed to be very low friction, which allows the transmission to change gears very quickly and smoothly without any slipping or stalling.  ","standard manual transmissions leave the operation of the clutch to the driver. dual clutch tranmissions have a computer thats controls the clutch thru vacuum and hydraulic systems. the computer doesn't make the mistake of misengaging the clutch . Dual clutch transmissions are basically a sequential manual transmission controlled by computers and therefore automated and programmed not to stall. If you are able to override the computer, then yes, it can be stalled. CVTs are like automatics and use a torque converter and will not stall as if it were an automatic. However it is not strictly true that CVTs cannot be stalled as nothing prohibits you from installing a foot-operated clutch to the CVT(same with automatics), in that case, it can still be stalled First, DCT: These transmissions use two clutches - one for even gears and one for odd gears. This is what helps make them so fast. As you are about the upshift or downshift, the computer ""readies"" the other clutch's gear by selecting the higher or lower gear depending on whether you want to go up or down a gear. When the next gear is connected, and the computer is ready to shift, it can very quickly release one clutch and engage the other. Then it can select the next gear again on the disengaged clutch. You save the ""gear change"" time consumed by a normal manual transmission. If we had more legs, we could do the same thing with 2 clutch pedals. That answers why they are fast and desirable, but why don't they stall? Well, the computer-controlled clutches do the same thing humans do while driving. When you come to a stop, the car selects first gear, but disengages the clutch. It can hold it's position using the brake (even if you aren't pressing it enough, like on a hill), or by slipping the clutch like a human might do. This can cause extra wear on a clutch, but it's pretty much the same way humans drive a manual transmission. The computer decides when you want to stay still, creep forward slightly, or move forward and continue accelerating. Then the computer modulates the clutch appropriately just like a human so that the car does this. This technology is still improving, and many people complain of ""jerky"" driving behavior especially in parking lots or with a cold car because the computer isn't as smooth with the clutch release as a human might be. CVTs: These actually use a torque converter typically. The ones that don't (like a motorcycle) use a clutch to follow the same principles as a normal manual transmission. CVT is all about the gears (not the clutch engagement of those gears). To understand how CVTs work, picture a typical multi-speed bicycle where you have front and rear gears. You know that by moving the derailleur in or out on the front or rear gear sets you can adjust for high power and fast acceleration with a low top speed, or low power with low acceleration but a much higher top speed. The whole time though the chain on the bike remains the same length (I know that fixed gear sizes actually mean the derailleur needs to pick up some slack, but I am simplifying the explanation). A CVT works on the same principle. Instead of using a chain, it uses a kind of belt that always stays in the same place. Both of the ""gears"" the belt rides on are actually like cones where one end is very small and the other end is very wide. Picture them like the small gear and the large gear on the back of the bicycle. By moving the cones towards or away from the belt, we can change the diameter of the front gear to be larger at the same time the rear gear is smaller (the belt stays in the same place). This would be like going to a large gear on the front of the bicycle, and a small gear on the back of the bicycle, except because they are cones the change is ""continuous"" instead of in steps like a bicycle. The result of all this is that we change the gear ratio in the transmission continuously, so as the car accelerates (higher MPH) we can adjust the gear ratio to keep the engine at the same speed (RPM). This is more fuel efficient and produces more power across the MPH range. EDIT: Added some paragraph separation so it doesn't look like a 5 year old typed this. some CVTs and DCTs use electronically controlled clutches (or similar tech), which automatically engage the clutch when the engine revs above a certain limit. these cars are notable, because they do not inch forward when you release the brakes while the engine is idling in drive gear. some CVTs and DCTs use torque converters, similar to how traditional automatic transmission vehicles. in both cases, the system actively prevents the engine from stalling.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 68.5, 'recall': 16.35, 'fmeasure': 26.4}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.57, 'recall': 3.46, 'fmeasure': 5.6}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.0, 'recall': 7.16, 'fmeasure': 11.56}}"

What is the science behind overclocking a CPU?,"The CPU is a computer chip that runs all the instructions that your computer needs to run. It's like a tiny computer inside your computer that runs all the programs you use. It does this by moving electrons around, which are tiny particles that carry electricity. The CPU has lots of tiny wires that carry these electrons, and it's all controlled by tiny switches that turn on and off. When a switch is turned on, it allows the electrons to move to a particular part of the CPU, and when a switch is turned off, it stops the electrons from moving. Overclocking a CPU means making the CPU run faster by making the switches turn on and off faster.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ","Imagine 500 workers in your company. Each worker fills out a form, their work. You give them 10 minutes for one form, since some guy has calculated that to be the best ""base clock speed"" of 3000 forms per hour. You actually sell your company to other people and they perform as advertised, but every company you sell has DIFFERENT workers (obviously). It is still kind of the same company though. It turns out, your workers fill out the form in 8 minutes on average and then meet in the hallway to chat. One of your customers thinks he can 'overclock' his company: he tells all the workers they only have 9 minutes to fill out the form. Works great, there were still resources left in that company and now you have a company that gives 3300 forms per hour (10% increase). One of the customers friends got wind of the overclocking and tries it with his company. It's horrible: the workers take 9 minutes on average to fill out a form, so on average they should meet the 9 minute requirement, but they have no more time to chat, get depression and burnout. Eventually a worker quits because he had enough. This is where your company becomes unstable and locks up, e.g. the overclocking went too far, not enough untapped resources were available, mistakes are made that cannot be undone, etc. The 'potential' for overclocking is different for each model and even differs with each CPU sold. If you increase the clock speed, some signals can get lost in transit if the physical layout of your CPU is 'bad' (this means that one of the circuit paths during the lithography process was less than ideal, too thick or too thin for example) so you also need to increase voltage, but THAT in turn increases temperature and also, since each circuit path is an antenna, the influence one circuit path can have on another. This can go to a point where to circuits cancel out each other's signals when they 'transmit radio signals' too much. That 'interference' is what cannot be overcome by any means other than designing the CPU differently. In essence, there's potential to do stuff faster. How MUCH is determined by the quality if the design AND the individual 'print' of your CPU. To get your CPU to a stable processing speed that is higher than what the manufacturer intended is tricky but can usually be done reliably without damaging the component by 1. increasing the frequency until failure 2. increase voltage to strengthen signal 3. repeat 1+2 until failure because of interference The reason a manufacturer picks a certain clock speed is simple: yield. One printed wafer gives a certain percentage of functional dies (the heart of your CPU). Each die is tested to run at the base clock speed. The better the design and the better the manufacturing process as well as how carefully chosen the clock speed is: more dies per wafer = more cash. The idea is to get the best die per wafer that can reliably be produced with as few losses as possible. Nothing is perfect, but some parts of the processor chip are better than others. The chip company, on the other hand, wants to have about 3 speeds of parts for sale. They test all the parts, to see how fast they can run without making mistakes. The parts that work best get the high speed rating, the middle parts get the middle rating, etc. You, on the other hand, only have one part in your computer. You can choose to provide better cooling than the chip manufacturer requires. As a result, you can choose to slightly increase the speed of your CPU to make a faster computer. It's a bit of work, and it gives you a non-standard configuration, but it might be worth it. Processor manufacturers practice boxing. They have one assembly line that makes all their CPUs of some kind. Then they test them. You see, manufacturing at the atomic scale isn't a perfected process, so lots of flaws make it in. If your CPU has 4 cores and one is dead, disable it and sell it as a 3 core CPU. This is why Intel has such variation in their product offering. The CPU you're running is discounted because it's mostly broken. The CPUs that make it through manufacturing fully functional are the top end offering and the most expensive. Among this testing process, they see how fast a CPU can change state, because there are some trillion-plus transistors that all have to switch at the same time, and your CPU can only go as fast as the slowest one. All this is ostensibly true. If their process improves and they make more fully functional CPUs, they may hamper the device intentionally, so they have commodity offerings and they can capture that segment of the market, lest they go to a competitor for a CPU in their price range. So all this is locked in to a CPU by physically breaking connections. Unlocking the CPU means reestablishing these connections that enable, at the very least, higher clock rates. The improved performance comes with a risk of reduced reliability and stability. It also means the device will run hotter, because faster switching speeds are accompanied with additional power consumption. There are overclocking motherboards, but they increase the bus speed, which is the speed your memory is running at, which is much lower than your CPU speed. This can give a good boost in performance because your CPU spends most of it's entire life idling, waiting for data to arrive from memory. This also comes with increased power consumption, and heat, and reduced stability and reliability. System memory, RAM, is made from banks of tiny capacitors which hold a tiny charge, and writing data to one requires either charging or discharging it. This takes time. If you run the bus speed too fast, then this transition can't happen fast enough, and you end up with memory corruption, false 0s and 1s.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 66.12, 'recall': 7.8, 'fmeasure': 13.95}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.83, 'recall': 1.85, 'fmeasure': 3.32}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 37.19, 'recall': 4.39, 'fmeasure': 7.85}}"
why is the tail wheel on an airplane usually tiny?,The tail wheel is used for steering the plane. It is not used for landing. The tail wheel is smaller because it doesn't need to be as strong to support the weight of the plane. It also needs to be able to move up and down in order to steer the plane. If it was larger it would be more difficult to steer the plane. The main wheels are larger because they need to be able to support the weight of the plane when it is on the ground. They also need to be able to handle the force of the plane when it is taking off and landing. The tail wheel is used to steer the plane. It is not used for landing. It is smaller because it doesn’t need to be as strong. It needs to be able to move up and down to steer the plane. If it was larger it would be harder to steer the plane. The main wheels are larger because they need to support the weight of the plane when it is on the ground. They also need to handle the force of the plane when it is taking off and landing.,"There’s not much weight on the rear of those aircraft so the smaller wheel works fine. The smaller wheel also saves weight. The center of gravity is almost over the front wheels, so there is very little weight on it. You can easily lift the tail of a single engine aircraft with one hand. You do not want a tail heavy plane (a front heavy plane flies badly, a tail heavy plane flies once). Also, you don't want anything heavy in the tail. 1 kg in the tails means you need 5 kg in the front to balance it, due to the leverage of the long tail. If you look at a taildragger landing or taking off, you'll also notice that the tail is only on the ground at low speeds. As soon as it gets some speed, the tail lifts and the plane becomes horizontal. That said, for these reasons and a few more, taildraggers are being phased out. They remain in some applications (aerobatics (weight), bush flying (robustness), glider towing (works better with the towing forces) and a few more), but most new aircraft use a nose wheel. They are less likely to ""nose-over"", and the pilot has a better field of view during taxi (if you look at old warbirds, which have a huge engine, you often see them zig-zag during taxi, because the pilot can't see straight ahead).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 38.81, 'recall': 32.77, 'fmeasure': 35.54}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.5, 'recall': 3.8, 'fmeasure': 4.12}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.4, 'recall': 17.23, 'fmeasure': 18.68}}"
"Why do Guitar strings go out of tune Sharp, and not Flat?","Because it's easier to tune a guitar string sharp, than it is to tune it flat. Think about it, if you're playing a note that is sharp, it's easier to tune the string up, than it is to tune it down. It's easier to tune a string up, because you can play the note you want to tune up to, and then you can tune the string to match that note. If you want to tune a string down, you have to play the note you want to tune down to, and then you have to tune the string to match that note. If you tune a string sharp, it's easier to tune the string down, because you can play the note you want to tune down to, and then you can tune the string to match that note. If you tune a string flat, it's easier to tune the string up, because you have to play the note you want to tune up to, and then you have to tune the string to match that note. I hope that makes sense.","Your strings have gained tension due to the change in temperature and humidity causing the wood of your guitar to expand and contract. Metal strings don't expand or contract enough to cause detectable tuning issues alone. The wood of your guitar, however, does. The truss rod does the best job it can for keeping your neck at the right angle relative to the body, but it's not perfect. A slight movement of the neck backwards (towards the z axis relative to the body of the guitar) will cause your strings to go sharp enough for your ear to discern. You can test further this by playing open strings and pushing on the headstock in different directions perpendicular to the body of the guitar--just don't push too hard. As relative humidity changes, the wood of the body and neck of a guitar will expand and contract in two ways: tangentially and radially. Tangential movement lies parallel to the growth rings of the wood while radial movement is perpendicular across the growth rings. Another thing to consider is that different species of wood are more hygroscopic than others. This simply means that one species, take Maple with a radial growth coefficient of 0.00353 for example, will absorb more water--and thus move more--than another species like Cherry that has a lower radial growth coefficient of 0.00248. So, while the neck of your guitar gains or looses moisture, the wood will expand and contract relative to one of the two directions I explained earlier. This movement in either direction can very well be enough to cause more tension on the strings, thus bending them sharp.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 27.13, 'recall': 18.28, 'fmeasure': 21.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.6, 'recall': 1.08, 'fmeasure': 1.29}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.55, 'recall': 11.83, 'fmeasure': 14.13}}"
Surveyors who survey land and roads before a new construction project. What are you doing?,Surveying is the process of determining the exact dimensions and position of a property or structure. We use various methods and tools to do this. One of the most common methods is called theodolite survey. This involves setting up a theodolite instrument on the property and using it to measure the distance between the instrument and a known point on the property. We then use this information to determine the position of the property corners. This is important for new construction projects because it allows us to know exactly where the property lines are and where the new construction will be. This is important for the construction company because it allows them to avoid any potential legal issues with the property owner. This is important for the property owner because it ensures that the construction company will not build on the property without permission.,"They are measuring the land (the actual dimension of plot, etc.) and the topography, or changes in elevation. They need to do this so they know exactly what work needs to be done, make sure they comply with set-back and other zoning considerations, know how much dirt needs to be cleared to level the site, and so on. I was a surveyor for a time. If you are talking about a road or construction, they are marking off exactly where everything is supposed to go. Both location and elevation. The place where a road is supposed to go is surveyed before any plans are made. This lets them know what space is available, etc to place the road. Then a plan is made that says, ""the road should go right here"". The surveyors come back and put in stakes and other markers that let people know, ""The center of the road should be here at this height"" and other things about where construction should occur. As they go, new surveying is done to make sure everything is where it is supposed to be. Also, when someone buys a piece of land, they also mark off where the piece of land is that the person is considering buying. The way all of this is done is by comparing to things that you know where they are. The little tripod thing- it shoots out a little laser light that reflects off a mirror on a stick held by a second person. They find location by determining the angle that the laser light was shot and the time it takes for the light to come back. The laser shooting thing is called a theodolite. Here is a pic URL_0 The mirror thing is called a traverse prism. It is usually on top of a stick held by a person. Here is a pic URL_1 If you have any specific questions, please do ask. I'm pretty sure I can answer them. Be happy to tell you about any of the specifics of pretty much anything. Roads and pipes and things need to be built at certain slopes to allow drainage to happen according to plan. So all the water that builds up on a roadway during a rainfall can roll off the road and into the storm drains where it can be properly carried away. If the road is sloped wrong the water may pool up and cause a serious hazard to traffic. When the road is being made, layers of sand and gravel are laid down and compacted. Surveyors measure the height of the land and the slope and tell the equipment operators where to shave a little off here or add a little there, until the numbers are all correct. There are markers all over the place, laid down in the past by surveyors for the government, that have known heights above sea level. These are used as a constant reference point to gauge the height of the measuring stick. There is a telescopic device on a tripod that the surveyor looks through and the assistant holds a very tall ruler and stands at the spot where they want to know the height of the ground. The surveyor looks through the telescope and reads the numbers on the ruler and through some simple math using the number obtained from the known marked point, the exact height of that particular location is now known. Mapping. Imagine you want to build a curb, sewer, bridge or even just lay down some new pavement. You want to design them accurately so they're easy to build and match into the existing conditions perfectly. Remember not everything you build starts on a clean plot of land, likely there are lots of man made objects you need to avoid or tie into. So to get your existing conditions, you need survey. Accuracy of topographic mapping (flying a plane and taking a picture) is accurate depending on the height of the plane, but say +-0.5 feet. That's usually only precise enough for large scale grading, not bridges, pavement, utility work. So you'll need higher accuracy. That means boots on the ground and survey usually by GPS. So you'll have a surveyor with a big rod, the bottom end is a point, the middle has a small computer, and the top has a super accurate GPS. This instrument gives an accuracy of +-0.005 feet in all directions. The surveyor will walk the entire site and mark all objects and a grid for anything in between. The surveyor will see an object, determine what the object is (say a manhole lid) then describe the object by inputting a code into the computer, then physically put the pointy end on the object to measure it's exact coordinates. Once you get all the coordinates and codes, you send it back to the office to process and produce a map of the site. As you can imagine this is a laborious process for big sites, but to make an engineer's work easier and more accurate a good survey is where it all starts.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 63.19, 'recall': 10.57, 'fmeasure': 18.11}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.88, 'recall': 3.14, 'fmeasure': 5.38}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.72, 'recall': 5.81, 'fmeasure': 9.95}}"

"Twin-Jet vs. Quad-Jet, and why the latter has a declining usage in Aviation Industry?","Quad-Jet is more fuel efficient than Twin-Jet. However, it is more expensive to maintain and has a higher noise level. In the aviation industry, the choice between the two is dependent on the route and the purpose of the flight. For shorter routes, Twin-Jet is more efficient. For longer routes, Quad-Jet is more efficient.","There are organizations who make rules about aeroplanes, so that the people who fly on them will stay safe. One of the rules is about how far an aeroplane is allowed to fly over the ocean away from land in case something goes wrong, so that it can get back again. Many years ago jet engines weren't very reliable or powerful, so plane makers had to use four of them to get across the oceans quickly and safely. Over time, new kinds of jet engines got more powerful by blowing more air round their outsides. So powerful in fact, that just two would do the job for even huge aeroplanes. Now it was no problem to cross the atlantic on just two engines - and of course it was much cheaper too! But in the beginning, they weren't sure how reliable just two engines could be, so the safety people made a law called ETOPS that said you had to stay within 60 minutes of land at all times, and be able to fly for that long if one engine failed. This wasn't very useful because it meant taking more indirect routes across oceans, staying near the land quite a lot. So some places still needed four engines to get to, while a few could use two. Over time, those new engines got ever more reliable and the safety people began trusting them more and more. They changed the law from 60 minutes away from land, to 120 minutes, then to 180 and recently to even 370 minutes! If you are allowed to fly 370 minutes away from land on two engines, then you can go pretty much anywhere you want in the world - so four engines aren't needed for safety any more except for the very biggest aeroplanes - who need them more for the power than reliability. And that's why you don't see many four-engined aeroplanes any more - because twins are much cheaper, and have become so unbelievably reliable that we trust them to fly more than six hours across the ocean, even with one engine failed.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.55, 'recall': 7.63, 'fmeasure': 13.11}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.26, 'recall': 0.85, 'fmeasure': 1.46}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.03, 'recall': 5.08, 'fmeasure': 8.74}}"

How is concrete poured/set underwater when making bridges?," In short, it's a combination of the right mix and a lot of pressure. Concrete is a mixture of cement, sand, and water. The cement is the hardening agent, the sand is the aggregate, and the water is the bonding agent. When you mix concrete, you need to make sure the water content is just right. If it's too wet, it will collapse under its own weight. If it's too dry, it won't set properly. If you're making a bridge, you need to make sure the concrete is set properly before it's subjected to the weight of the bridge. This is why you need to pour the concrete in sections. You start at one end of the bridge and pour it in sections. Once the first section is set, you move on to the next section and pour it. Once you've set the last section, you let it cure for a few days before you put the bridge on top. If you're building a bridge in the ocean, you need to make sure the concrete is strong enough to withstand the pressure of the water. You can do this by adding more cement to the mix. The more cement you add, the stronger the concrete will be. You can also add steel reinforcement to the concrete. This is a steel mesh that you put into the concrete before you pour it.  ","When they can or are required to, they remove the water from the area by putting down something around the intended concrete volume to keep the water out, essentially like a ""moat of air"" that's either open on top or fully sealed. [It's called a cofferdam if open]( URL_1 ). When they can't or it's not cost-effective to do that, they can use underwater concrete, which is usually poured via pipe into prebuilt forms. The heavier concrete displaces the water as it fills the form. In many bridges, particularly ones that cross deep water, they manufacture the posts and stands for the bridge elsewhere and move them to their locations. Requires some pretty damn big transports to do this though. [Here's how the parts look for the ""Confederation Bridge"" which connects Prince Edward Island across 12 kilometers of the Atlantic Ocean to New Brunswick in Canada.]( URL_0 ) I saw some of this in action and it was pretty impressive engineering. When the conditions are right, for some really big projects like dams, for example, they divert rivers to other areas until the structure is ready.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 28.45, 'recall': 35.42, 'fmeasure': 31.55}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.78, 'recall': 4.71, 'fmeasure': 4.2}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.9, 'recall': 19.79, 'fmeasure': 17.63}}"

This accomplishes two essential goals is watch design. It minimizes energy loss due to friction, allowing the watch to run longer between windings. It also makes the movement much more consistent, translating to better accuracy. Because some gems like sapphire are really resistant to abrasion.

How is it possible for AC current to move from point A to point B?,"( URL_0 ) > AC (Alternating Current) is the flow of electric charge that reverses direction periodically. This means that the current flows in one direction for a certain period of time, and then reverses direction for the same amount of time. This is in contrast to DC (Direct Current), which flows in one direction only. AC is what is used in homes and businesses. AC is what allows the power in your wall sockets to turn on and off. > > > > AC is a sinusoidal waveform. This means that the voltage (electrical pressure) varies in a sinusoidal pattern, with the voltage being at its highest at the peak of the waveform, and at its lowest at the trough.  ","They do not. In an AC line, the electrons move less than 1 meter before the current reverses direction. But *all the electrons throughout the wire* move back and forth together, like a mob in a very crowded room. The electrons don't, current does. Think of hose filled with water, the water is the electrons, but when you turn the water on it instantly flows out the other end, the water didn't instantly travel the full length of the hose, but the pressure did, and it pushed the water at the other end out. You could have two hose and alternate what one is one and what one is off to get the water to flow back and forth from one hose to the other and back. The water would move back and forth, and work can be extracted from the flow. But in that case the water is just moving back and forth a few inches at the time, and isn't moving in any particular direction over the long term.

"The recently released footage of the “UFO” filmed by US Fighter Jet Pilots. So if it’s not aliens, what is it?","I am going to be honest here. I am not an expert in this field and I am not sure I can answer this question. I am not a scientist, I am not a pilot, I am not an engineer. I am just an ordinary citizen who is interested in this topic. I have been following this topic for a while now, and I am intrigued. I have watched all the videos, read all the articles, and read all the comments. I have even read all the conspiracy theories. I have to say, I am still confused. There are so many theories and opinions, but no one seems to know for sure. It is like the UFO mystery is never going to be solved.

","When the US launched a raid on Osama Bin Laden, Seal Team Six breached an ally's border in a top secret stealth helicopter that had never been seen publicly before. The only reason anyone found out about it was because the helicopter crashed and though they attempted to destroy the helicopter with explosives, it wasn't fully destroyed. The most likely explanation is that, just like the US uses top secret drones, satellites, and other aircraft to spy on it's allies, other countries also use top secret locally developed equipment to spy on the US as well. China, Russia, India, Israel, etc. are all possible origins of this aircraft. UFO simply means it's unidentified, not that its extraterrestrial. But it's a lot more fun to think about aliens visiting than countries spying on each other. We don't know, its Unidentified. However, it 'could' be...light reflected off of optics or glass; forged video and audio; human created aircraft; slow moving meteor, time-travelers. It could also be misleading if any of the statements made by the pilots or video readings were mistakes in judgment, like wind speed and direction. This video is of the vintage, that I would expect the pilots would have coming forward and claim to have seen it or been the ones recording it. The fact this hasn't happened (yet) gives me some pause in the veracity of the video. Even if they do come forward in the future, any number of explanations make more sense than aliens. It's an experimental surveillance balloon drone that uses dynamic supercavitation to make rapid changes in velocity and direction. These drones use both lighter-than-air gasses, a local low pressure atmospheric manipulation, and heat, to maintain buoyancy. This is why the object appears warm, with a surrounding bubble of cool air. The drone is only capable of operating at high altitudes with extreme wind (hence the 138 MPH winds cited in the video.) These drones are launched from submarines and are controlled using various methods. Newer systems use a main controlling drone that communicates with the rest of the networked swarm for less latency. This eliminates the need for the submarine to maintain direct control, and much of the decision making is left to pre-programmed flight path and AI that is designed to adapt to environmental situations. Spreading the drone swarm over a large enough area, satellite communications become viable, and human controllers are permitted. Some drone systems (aerostats) are tethered to an underwater extraction vehicle. When the drones are spotted, the submersed vehicle fills underwater ballasts and quickly descends. The drones, likewise, deflate their own lifting gasses, thus filling the surrounding supercavity vacuum, and creating a rapid decent. An envelope of pressurized air is created before re-entry into the water, however, newer systems forgo retrieval and instead are designed to be destroyed upon impact. This explains several things: 1) How did the vehicle make such advanced and rapid maneuvers? (supercavitation) 2) Why did the vehicle appear to have such a strange heat signature? (vacuum combined with low-pressure zone) 3) Why was the water below the craft behaving in such a unique manner? (submersible craft for either release or extraction) 4) Why was there a ""fleet"" of them noticed on the ASA (radar)? (swarm ability for better communication and surveillance) 5) Why did this event occur in the ocean, during a military exercise? (typical military testing itself) 6) Why did the craft operate in such windy conditions? (supercavitation is only capable in these conditions with current technology) 7) Why did the craft turn sideways? (retrieval stance requires maneuvering towards submersible) 8) Why did the Pentagon scramble some of the pilots language?

How do they make stainless steel truly stainless?,"The term ""stainless"" refers to the lack of staining. The stainless steel is made by combining iron, nickel, and chromium.

Depends on the quality of the ""stainless"" steel and the conditions it's exposed to. In general, it's ""stainless"" because it's a mixture of metals that cause it to form a protective, hard layer of oxide as it corrodes which prevents oxygen from reaching the metal underneath and continuing to corrode more.

"If an airliner is flying at 30,000ft the outside temperature is around -30F, so why do airliners need to run A/C instead of heat while at cruising altitude?","There's a lot of air in the atmosphere. Airplanes are moving very fast, and that air is moving very fast. This is what creates the wind that we feel on the ground. The air is moving so fast that it is creating a sort of ""wind tunnel"" effect. This is what causes airplanes to fly. Now, when you are flying at 30,000 feet, the air is moving at 30,000 feet per second. That's fast. This is why you need to fly at a very high speed in order to get up to 30,000 feet. But, when you are at 30,000 feet, the air is not moving as fast as it is at the surface. So, this means that you don't need as much air to keep you flying. This is why airplanes at 30,000 feet don't need to fly as fast as they do when they are at the surface. They just need to fly fast enough to stay in the air. And, the air is not as cold at 30,000 feet as it is at the surface. This is why airplanes don't need to run heaters at 30,000 feet.  ","Basically the engines suck in air and compress it before mixing in fuel and igniting it. When you compress air, it gets hot. Turbofan engines compress the air so much it heats up to oven-like temperatures. In order to pressurized the cabin, airplanes ""bleed"" a small amount of this high pressure air from the compressor sections of the engines, but it has to be cooled so that it doesn't cook the passengers. A person produces about [100 watts of heat]( URL_0 ). That's the same heat as a 100 watt lightbulb. Or to put it another way, a basic [space heater]( URL_1 ) equals about 15 people.

The air pressure in the cabin is the same as the air pressure outside. If you were to open the door or window, you would be sucked out of the plane. If you were to open it in a descent, the air pressure would be too low and you would be sucked out. It's not a question of ""pressure equalizing"" but the air pressure being too low to allow you to survive.","That is pretty much what they do, except without opening a door or window. Oxygen masks in the passenger cabin are only intended to give enough oxygen while the aircraft descends to a height where they're no longer needed.

"Why do leather belts start out straight, but after being worn a lot, get curved?","The leather is made of fibers, and those fibers are stretched when the belt is worn. The fibers get thinner, and the leather gets softer. The leather is now thinner and softer, so it is able to bend more easily. As it bends, it forms a curve. This is why your belt will get curved over time.","When one bends over or even sits, the back belt loop pulls down on the belt where the pants would want to gap. Over time, this stretches it out and causes it to curve. A straight flat belt fits around a cylinder perfectly. Chances are you're not cylinder, because you have a bum, and maybe some belly. Your girth is bigger at the bottom of your belt than at the top of the belt. ( A contoured waistband is curved instead of straight, but most ready to made clothes have straight waistbands because it takes less fabric.) When you sit down your body becomes longer in the back and shorter in the front. The pants will rise in the front and make accordion folds, while the back will pull down lower and the straight waistband wants to stick out from your body. In this position you aren't anything like a cylinder. Your hips are not a perfect circle. A leather belt will reshape itself around your bodies natural curvature. the belt gets conditioned into a curve from being held in that position for long amounts of time, or multiple periods of use (E.G. from wearing it). you can achieve a similar result when conditioning a new baseball glove (rubbing conditioner the leather, putting ball in mit, then wrap a few rubber-bands around it.) baseball players do this whenever getting a new glove because it helps them catch the ball easier.

How do speedometers work on boats?," The speedometer is a mechanical device that measures the rotational speed of a shaft. The shaft is connected to a propeller or other device that generates torque. The torque causes the shaft to rotate, which in turn causes the speedometer to measure the speed of the shaft. The shaft is connected to the propeller by a transmission, which is a system of gears that transfer the power from the engine to the propeller. The transmission is designed to provide the right gear ratio to match the engine speed to the propeller speed. The transmission includes a gearbox, which is a set of gears that are designed to transfer power from the engine to the propeller. The gearbox includes a set of reduction gears, which are gears that reduce the speed of the engine to match the speed of the propeller. The reduction gears are designed to provide the right reduction ratio to match the speed of the propeller to the speed of the engine. The transmission also includes a set of multiplication gears, which are gears that increase the speed of the propeller. The multiplication gears are designed to provide the right multiplication ratio to match the speed of the propeller to the speed of the engine. The multiplication gears are used to increase the speed of the propeller, which in turn increases the speed of the boat.  ","Besides GPS, a ship uses a speed log to determine speed. There are multiple types of speed logs: - Impeller log: A small device with a propeller is towed or attached to the ship. When the ship moves along the water, the force turns the propeller. The rotational speed of the propeller is proportional to the speed of the ship - Pitometer: A tube faces the direction of the ship and another tube faces 90 degrees. When the ship moves, the water pressure builds up in the forward facing tube while the 90 degree tube remains at static water pressure. The meter calculates the difference in pressure between the two tubes, which is proportional to the speed of the vessel. - Doppler log: The Doppler log emits a sonar wave (TX). The wave travels out, bounces back, and returns to the receiver of the log (RX). If the ship is still, the TX and RX have the same and frequency. However, due to the Doppler effect, the forward motion of a ship compresses the waves closer together, changing the frequency. The change in frequency is proportional to the change in speed. Finally, on larger ships, you can determine the speed by doing calculations using the engine RPM, the pitch, and the load. This will give you the mathematical speed, but won't account for friction and other variables. The classic analog speed sensors are just little paddle wheels on the transom or bottom of a boat. There are also pitot tube versions. Now we just use GPS for speed over ground. In the old, old days, they would throw a piece of wood(log) tied to knotted line overboard and count the knots. Thus, knots for speed. It depends on what you mean by speed. Speed over ground, or the rate at which you cross from one geospatial point to another, is determined by GPS. Speed through the water, or the speed at which the water is passing by the hull, can be determined a few ways. Olden times, a log on a regularly knotted rope was thrown overboard. The number of knots to pass over the gunwale corresponded to the speed in ""knots."" Today, a number of methods including a small free-spinning prop (flow meter) and doppler are used. If you don't need to be terribly exact and you know the vessel, many of us just approximate based on engine RPM.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 52.63, 'recall': 29.93, 'fmeasure': 38.16}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.78, 'recall': 7.25, 'fmeasure': 9.25}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.02, 'recall': 18.2, 'fmeasure': 23.21}}"

The shell has a small impact point that it shoots and that is where it hits the target. The sight is adjusted to compensate for wind, elevation, and declination.

"How do cellphones slow down ""naturally"" after 2 years or so?","It’s not that they slow down, it’s that they stop getting updates and support. The hardware in them can still run the software, but the manufacturer stops providing new software and security patches. The reason for this is that they want to encourage people to buy newer phones, and they want to make money.","They don't. I explain this to my customers at least twice a week. One of the biggest misconceptions in the world of computer technology is that it slows down as it gets older. Computers (including mobile devices like phones) don't slow down with age. They are exactly as fast today as they were (x) years ago when you purchased it. That 2.5GHz computer you bought three years ago is still running at 2.5GHz. Technically, the term you're looking for isn't ""slower"" but ""less responsive"". It is an accurate assessment that computers et al often get less responsive over the years. So why are they less responsive with age? If you discount legitimately accidental programming bugs then you have a few reasons: 1. Additional code to the existing operating system, generally in the form of OS and/or security updates. Any time you add additional code, the device has to spend time executing that code. Security updates, OS updates, maintenance patches, etc all contribute additional code that the device has to process. This takes time away from other tasks, like registering a mouse click or a finger tap, so your device feels less responsive. 2. New OS installation. As with the additional code issue, new OS's typically have more features and functions than the OS it replaces. This is additional code that your device has to process. 3. OS degradation. All OS's crash, even phone OS's. Sometimes when this happens the OS can be damaged which can result in unpredictable behavior. Take something simple: setting the clock. Let's say the (simplified) code for setting the clock is ""every 2 minutes, reach out to URL_0 and set the clock"" and normally this works perfectly and invisibly. But then there's OS corruption and the code turns into ""every 2 seconds, reach out to URL_0 and set the clock"" which means the phone is going to be doing little more than setting the clock all the time. Or even ""every 2 minutes, reach out to jknwjkdhsiuh and set the clock"" which will result in the phone making potentially hundreds of DNS requests to jknwjkdhsiuh which doesn't exist, so the phone basically gets locked into an error loop. 4. Apps that overextend the capabilities of the device. Pokemon Go was released in June 2016, just a few months before the iPhone 7 was released. It was quite playable on an iPhone 6S, but on my iPhone 5 it was ridiculously slow. It worked, yeah, but it was slow and it sucked battery life like there's no tomorrow. The app is just too big for the iPhone 5 to run efficiently -- but the app was never designed to be run efficiently on the iPhone 5 in the first place. Apps are generally designed around the current, and perhaps the next, generation of hardware. If it runs on older hardware then, yay, but that's more of a happy circumstance than an intended result. So how do you avoid this? Simple. Don't upgrade your OS after a new hardware revision comes out. Don't install any new apps or update your existing apps after a new hardware revision comes out. If your device crashes, clean-reinstall the OS and repeat. Your device will remain as lively and responsive as it was the first day you took it out of the box. And as far as the Apple thing goes, that's another misconception. Apple *did not* slow down **old** phones. What Apple did was, they programmed the OS to identify dying batteries and in response throttled CPU performance so as to allow the battery to power the phone throughout the day (rather than dying in the early afternoon). Yes, old phones accounted for most of the affected devices because their batteries were naturally older. But if you had an iPhone 7 or 8 with a dying or defective battery, you would have seen exactly the same thing. IMO Apple didn't do anything wrong with this programming decision. What they *did* do wrong, IMO, was when customers came in to complain about ""slow phones"" they didn't direct them to have a new battery installed, but instead directed them to buy a new phone. That's a really shitty and evil thing to do. Default your device back to factory settings and then see if it acts the same way. Usually, I find that there a rouge apps running in the background sucking up available memory / cpu cycles (that even a restart of the device doesn't clear). The kind of battery technology we use right now, at least, is only good for a certain number of charges. Afterwards, it's capacity starts to drop, as does it's output. A lot of the time what people really need is a new battery. Most also use solid state memory, which also has a limited number of writes and rewrites before it starts to suffer damage and lose some speed and capacity.

Your computer is simply sending color data that the display circuitry turns into voltage to control the crystal polarization that lets a fraction of the available backlight out. First, your computer just does math at a speed you you cannot imagine. A 3 GHz processor, like an average desktop computer, can theoretically make as many as 3,000,000,000 calculations every second. That's more than enough to draw 2,073,600 pixels 30 time a second. (1080x1920 resolution at 30 frames per second.)

You you've had graphical glitches in games or even just stuttering frames on you screen, you've seen a time where the program running might just be too much for the hardware to handle. Edit: if you're asking about the manufacturing side of things, remember that each pixel isn't a distinct light, but an adjustable filter made out of liquid crystals with a backlight of LED's behind them.

"Since metal is a conductor, why are electrical boxes made of metal?","The reason that electrical boxes are made of metal is because the metal is strong enough to withstand the stress of the electricity. Electricity is a very strong force, and if it were to flow through a weak material, it would deform or even break the material. This would cause a short circuit, which could be very dangerous. The metal is also a good conductor, so it can carry the electricity without losing any of it. The metal is also a good conductor, so it can carry the electricity without losing any of it.","Electrical boxes are made out of metal *because* metal is conductive! The metal of the box is grounded/earthed so that if it's touched by a live wire, the electricity will be safely redirected away from anything that could be harmed by it (blowing a fuse or tripping a breaker in the process). A plastic electrical box could melt and catch fire when exposed to a large electrical current. The box is *supposed to be* tied to ground so that if there is a miswire and something touches the box then it will short to ground and trip the breaker, cutting the power and making everything safe again. The wires in the box should be properly insulated as well, this keeps them from touching things they aren't supposed to and keeps the electricity only in the wires that it is supposed to be in. Metal boxes are also really inexpensive. You take a sheet of steel, fold it a few times, throw in a few rivets and you've got a box. This is much easier than injection molding a plastic box which really wasn't an option until relatively recently.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.32, 'recall': 26.94, 'fmeasure': 36.24}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.9, 'recall': 6.25, 'fmeasure': 8.42}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 35.11, 'recall': 17.1, 'fmeasure': 23.0}}"
Why do some lights hum?,The hum is usually caused by an electrical current flowing through the bulb. This is especially common in compact fluorescent bulbs. The hum is caused by the electrical current flowing through the bulb. It is very similar to the hum of a fan or air conditioner. This is why some people prefer to use incandescent bulbs because they don’t hum.,"It's typically old fluorescent, LED or halogen lights which can't run straight on 110 / 230 V AC and therefore have a big transformer or ballast, basically big copper coils. Those cause a hum because when you run an AC current through a copper coil, it creates an alternating magnetic field, which makes the whole thing vibrate. Modern LED and CFL lights don't do that because they use more efficient electronic circuits for that purpose. These also have copper coils, but they run at much higher frequencies so we typically can't hear them. If they do, it's a very annoying, high pitched sound. Older, non-electronic fluorescent ballasts often make noise when the steel plates (laminations) in the core of the inductor get loose or the magnetic field causes nearby sheet metal to vibrate. Ballasts used to be sold with various audible noise ratings. Newer bulbs also contain inductors which can buzz if used with dimmers. Are they on a dimmer? A modern light dimmer works by turning the power on or off part way through a cycle. This results in a sudden inrush of power into the light 120 times per second. This inrush causes things to change shape quickly which makes them ring or buzz depending on how they're built.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 47.54, 'recall': 13.36, 'fmeasure': 20.86}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.33, 'recall': 0.93, 'fmeasure': 1.45}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.59, 'recall': 6.91, 'fmeasure': 10.79}}"
how do hotels have enough hot water for all their guests. Big hotels like Las Vegas and such?,"Hotels have hot water tanks, and the hot water is pumped to the floors. They have a system in place to keep the water hot. Hotels use a combination of hot water tanks and heat exchangers to keep water hot. The water is pumped to the floors and the water is heated as it flows through the pipes.","Hotals don't usually have to preheat water. There are flowthrough water heaters that heat the water while it is running through the pipes. So as long as there is power, there is warm water available without needing to build up a reservoir. They have really big water heaters. I work at a hotel of 80 rooms & we have four water heaters on the first floor. Never any complaints from guests. At a 15 floor 200 + room hotel, we had one giant heater in the basement. That one sucked. Ive also worked at places with a couple heaters on the roof, another with heaters on each floor. Im in the maintance department at a 17 floors 380 room hotel. Usually you have boilers and a holding tank. Boilers heat the water and store it in the holding tank which can hold around 500gallons or such. You then have hot water risers that send the water to the guest rooms. Because these buildings are so large you have a recirculation line for hot water. So essentially the hot water is constantly flowing even not in use. This is so you have instant hotwater when you need it. You usually have pumps on the supply and return lines, depending on water pressure to circulate. If it did not constantly flow, the further you are from the boilers/holding tank the longer it would take to get hot water. This would be because as its not being used it was start to cool down. Then you would have to run the water till it gets hot again. There are also a ton of factors that play into a hotels water system that can royally screw with it. If it takes longer than 15 seconds to get hot water, theres a problem. Plumbing and HVAC designer here... There are many options to heat water for large buildings. The simplest is to have a large water heater for each wing/floor. This can get expensive real fast especially if you have a situation like a Vegas hotel. The most popular is to have high temperature boilers and large storage tanks in a central location. You can heat the water up to around 180°F and then mix it with cold water through a thermostatic mixing valve to make 120°F water. This makes the 180° water last longer and you don't need as much storage. Another mandatory piece of equipment in almost all commercial applications is a recirculation pump. It pumps a designed amount of water from the hot water pipe at the furthest fixture back to the water heater. The amount of water pumped is determined by a set of calculations that take into account the size of pipe and pipe material. Constantly recirculating the water keeps the water in the pipe hot and you don't have to wait for hot water for very long.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 81.03, 'recall': 9.73, 'fmeasure': 17.38}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 26.32, 'recall': 3.11, 'fmeasure': 5.57}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 58.62, 'recall': 7.04, 'fmeasure': 12.57}}"

Why does the FCC require devices to accept interference?," Sounds like an interesting topic. I'm not sure why they require it. I'd love to know more.

I'm sure it's not their job to make sure devices don't interfere with each other, but it's probably a good idea. There's a lot of things that could go wrong, and it's better to have the FCC be involved to prevent any problems.

Pilots occasionally note some interference from government comms, but can't do much more than switch to another frequency. Further down the list are public broadcast stations, radio and TV. They are also serving the public good, unless you look at their bland content :-) Normal people should not be interfering with TV broadcasts, this means your power drill or computer interfering with your neighbors soap opera is a bad thing. If your neighbor complains, you must stop using your drill or switch off your computer. At the bottom of the shit pile is consumer electronics.

Why do they launch boats sideways instead of forward when first launching them?,"Because the boats are not yet balanced. If they launch them forward, they will flip over and sink. If they launch them sideways, they will flip over and sink, but they will also have a chance to float back up. The boat is not yet balanced because the weight of the boat is not yet evenly distributed. When they launch the boat, the weight of the boat is concentrated at the bottom. As the water fills the boat, the weight of the boat is distributed evenly. This is why the boat is able to float and move forward.","Boats are designed to have their weight supported for the entirety of the keel length.

"If oil comes from the ground, then why are oil leaks from a pipe back into the ground such a big deal or does it only apply to leaking in water supplies?","Oil comes from the ground, but it is not the same as the oil you buy at the gas station.

Why do you have to wait a few seconds before starting a Diesel engine car?," The reason is that the engine needs time to warm up before it can start. It's not just the engine itself, but the fuel system, the oil system and the exhaust system. The fuel system needs to warm up so that the fuel can flow freely through the engine. The oil system needs to warm up so that the oil can flow through the engine and lubricate all the moving parts. The exhaust system needs to warm up so that the gases can flow through the exhaust system and out of the car. If the engine is started too quickly before the systems are warm, the fuel can't flow properly, the oil can't lubricate the engine and the exhaust system can't get rid of the gases properly. This can cause the engine to stall, and potentially damage the engine.","Diesel is hard to ignite. If the diesel is cold it will not even ignite in the engine. So diesel engines comes with electric glow plugs that can heat up the fuel before it enters the combustion chamber. These glow plugs take a little while to heat up. So when you turn on the ignition the glow plugs are connected. You may have a light that turns off when the glow plugs have heated up. You can then start the engine with the heated fuel. If the weather is cold you have to wait for longer and if the weather is hot or the engine have recently run you may not need to wait at all. To explain this, I think it makes sense to explain how gasoline works in comparison, first. People, myself included, generally seem a lot more comfortable with it's operation. Gasoline would be considered ""lighter"" than diesel, meaning it will boil at a lower temperature than diesel will. This is pretty much how the two are separated. If you imagine a big pot of gas and diesel, refineries turn the heat on, and at a certain temperature, the gasoline will boil off just like steam when you boil water. The vapors are ""caught"", cooled back down into a liquid, and you have gasoline in one container and diesel in your original container. A lot more goes into it than this, but this is a start. However, this exact method of separation is really the key to the difference. At room temperature, gasoline readily gives off vapors. No extra heat is necessary. So when gas and air are injected into the cylinder, the spark plug ignites the vapors already present, and this is what drives the piston. Diesel, on the other hand, does not give off a lot of vapor at room temperature. One would say that it's boiling point is too high to do so. So if you add a spark, there isn't anything to ignite. Liquids don't burn, the vapors do, thus we need to add heat to vaporize it. The interesting thing with diesel is that it is added to the cylinder with air as little tiny (atomized) droplets. The piston then compresses the space in the cylinder. When the air and diesel are compressed, all the little gas and air particles run into each other because there isn't as much room, and when this happens they generate heat. The heat from the compression vaporizes the diesel, which we needed, and it actually heats the fuel up so much that it ignites on its own, and drives the piston. Where letting your engine warm up comes into play is when its cold and the heat from compression is not enough heat to vaporize the diesel. It needs a little extra boost of heat. Now I'm not actually a car guy, so I'd be curious to know if technology has improved any such that new cars don't require the same TLC. Diesel and gas haven't changed (much), so maybe there isn't much technology can do aside from insulated or gently heated fuel tanks or something. I work at a refinery, so that is my two cents on the process as it relates to diesel and gas, but I'd love to hear a real car guy's thoughts.

","The binary number system is a base-two system. The system most people use is a base-ten system. A base ten system is based on powers of ten. Each position is multiplied by a power of ten to get the resulting value. For example, the number 101 is actually 1 * 10^2 + 0 * 10^1 + 1 * 10^0, which equals 100 + 0 + 1, which equals 101. Binary is based on powers of two. The binary number 101 actually represents 1 * 2^2 + 0* 2^1 + 1* 2^0, which equals 4 + 0 + 1, which equals 5. That's the basics of binary; how computers use binary is complicated, but it basically boils down to the fact that in binary, the only possible values are 0 and 1 (unlike in base-10, where the values range from 0 to 9). Computer engineers have taken advantage of this, and have set the computers up so that if there's electricity on a given wire, that counts as a 1, and if there's no electricity on a given wire, that counts as a 0. When you press a key on an analog keyboard, you're completing a switch. The switch sends electricity down a series of wires (called a ""bus""); each key corresponds to a different series. Originally, alphanumeric characters were represented by a system called ASCII, which assigned a given graphical character to a given 8-bit (that's 8 digit wide) binary number. I think most keyboards use Unicode or something else now, but the principle is the same. Completing the switch sends a specific pattern of electricity down the bus; the computer knows to display the correct symbol in response to that particular pattern.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 42.22, 'recall': 26.57, 'fmeasure': 32.62}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.26, 'recall': 4.56, 'fmeasure': 5.6}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.0, 'recall': 12.59, 'fmeasure': 15.45}}"

Why are objects smaller than they appear in rear-view mirrors?,"I think it's a combination of the physical effects of aging (your body is slowly getting weaker and less resilient), and the psychological effects of aging (you're more aware of your own mortality). But I think the biggest reason is that your body's ability to regenerate and repair itself is decreasing over time. For example, your muscles are less able to repair themselves after exercise, and your bones are less able to repair themselves after injury. You can also lose your hair, and your skin becomes thinner and less elastic. Your body also has a harder time regulating your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. These changes can make you feel like you're getting weaker and less resilient, even if you're not actually getting weaker.","Passenger-Side mirrors are often convex, in order to provide a larger field of view.

This is a multi part answer, and I'll do the best I can. Engines rely on lubrication from engine oil to be able to run. Engine oil is responsible for preventing wear, reducing friction, preventing corrosion, and is used as a hydraulic fluid within the engine. Because of all of the properties it has to achieve, even the lowest-viscosity oils available are rather thick. Ever heard the expression ""slow as molasses in winter time""? As viscous(thick) liquids cool down, they become more viscous, gradually getting thicker as temperature drops, until the eventually freeze. Engine oil does not exactly ""freeze"" in any conditions you'd likely find in nature, but it does get quite thick when it's in very cold climates. They make special oils with very low viscosities for cold-climate operation, but even those have a hard time in climates where temperatures are below 0* F. If oil within an engine becomes too thick, it cannot do its job properly and damage to the engine or poor performance could occur. The device in question is called an Engine Block Heater. It is basically a powerful electric blanket that plugs in to household power, and it warms the engine block constantly. The warming prevents the engine oil from becoming too thick, so when you go outside to start the car, it's much easier to start, and prevents damage from extremely cold starts. The increased engine temperature also helps with combustion, or the burning of fuel /air inside the engine. Engines run most efficiently at a certain temperature, and when they start at a very cold temperature, much more fuel is used and wasted to achieve combustion. Engine block heaters are not commonly sold built in to vehicles, and are an accessory that must be added if needed. In very extreme climates, diesel-fueled vehicles also use heaters inside the fuel tanks to prevent the diesel fuel from becoming a gel in the extreme cold. This is because diesel fuel is much more viscous than gasoline, and behaves similarly to engine oil in cold temperatures. It's kind of like insulating your plumbing pipes in the winter to keep them from freezing.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.4, 'recall': 27.42, 'fmeasure': 33.61}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.41, 'recall': 4.04, 'fmeasure': 4.96}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.28, 'recall': 13.44, 'fmeasure': 16.47}}"

Your car is turning it off with it's headlights. This is an indication of a faulty light sensor and you should report it to the township. Older ones also overheat and shut off periodically so if you are noticing them a lot you'll see them turn off every so often I had no idea anybody else noticed this, and I am too creeped out to google anything. But I agree with others, it's probably just that we notice the ones that turn off and flicker since they stand out. We don't notice the ones that work. The ones that do it all the time are probably broken. The ones that you notice are just that, the ones you notice. You don't notice the fully functioning street lamps because they're doing their job correctly. The ones you do notice that suddenly turn off when you go under it just *happened* to short circuit/get burnt/get falsely tripped off at that moment. Sorry, you're not psychic, nor is your car (though that would be dope). You're just noticing it happen because it's something out of the ordinary. Did this happen once, or has it happened more than once under similar circumstances? What were those circumstances? I told reddit about this being my lame super power a couple years ago. They came through. URL_0 On my daily route to my last job there was one street light on an overpass that very consistently went out as I approached it. This happened for years. For all I know it went out every 5 minutes but it was still strange at the time. You're probably finding yourself under a high pressure sodium-vapor lamp. As they age, they start to cycle repeatedly. This cycling is caused by a lack of sodium in the bulb, which is lost over time due to the reaction created which is what makes the arc, producing the light. What happens is that the light will start up, but as the arc reaches full intensity, there is not enough sodium left to maintain it, and it basically flames out and starts all over again.

Why is the leaning tower of Pisa actually leaning?," Pisa is a city in Italy. It’s a city with a long history. People have been living there for a long time. A long time ago, the people of Pisa built a big tower. The tower was meant to be a church. The tower was called the Pisa Cathedral. The people of Pisa built the tower in the 1200s. It was supposed to be 180 feet tall. But the tower was built on a weak foundation. It was built on soft ground. The ground was soft because it was full of water. The water made the ground weak. The tower was supposed to be straight. But the tower started to lean. The tower started to lean because the ground was weak. The tower leaned and leaned. Eventually, the tower was 20 feet off the ground. People were worried that the tower would fall down.   were worried that the tower would fall down and hurt people. But they couldn’t fix the tower.   couldn’t fix the tower because the ground was too soft.   tried to fix the tower.   tried to fix the tower by digging into the ground.   tried to fix the tower by putting big rocks under the tower.   tried to fix the tower by building a wall around the tower. But they couldn’t fix the tower. The tower was still leaning. But the people of Pisa didn’t give up.  ","The leaning of the leaning tower of Pisa is due to both a wrong assumption and poor engineering. When the second floor of the tower was being built, the soil under the tower began to sink. This was because of a very weak 3 meter foundation. The construction temporarily stopped because of the war going on at the time. Construction was resumed after a century when engineers decided to compensate for the tilt by building the upper floors having one side larger than the other. This is the reason why the tower has a curvature to it. Some engineers also try to do stuff with the soil underneath which caused the tower to lean even more. The later engineers didn't want to touch anything because of the fear that the monument would topple. In due course of time it became famous because of the tilt and people decided to keep it that way.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 31.62, 'recall': 48.05, 'fmeasure': 38.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.58, 'recall': 8.5, 'fmeasure': 6.74}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.95, 'recall': 27.27, 'fmeasure': 21.65}}"
Why is it so difficult to create accurate hot-cold water controls for toilet use?,"I have no idea, but I would imagine it’s because it’s hard to get the temperature right. Hot water is hot, and cold water is cold. How do you measure that? Do you have a thermometer in the toilet? If you do, how do you know it’s accurate? Do you have a way to get that temperature to the water? How do you do that? I’d imagine it’s hard to get it right. You’d have to have a heating and cooling system in the toilet that’s accurate and can be controlled. And then you’d have to have a way to get that temperature to the water. And then you’d have to have a way to make sure the water is hot enough to kill bacteria. And then you’d have to have a way to make sure the water is cold enough to be good for your skin. I’m sure there’s a lot of stuff like that that you have to think about.","The range that you find 'ideal' is relatively narrow compared to the range of temperatures delivered by your hot and cold water pipes. Temperature sensors lag actual temperature by a noticeable amount. Hydraulic systems react to slowly to mechanical changes. Changes in temperature cause changes in pressure that can impact your hot/cold mix. This combines to create an engineering problem where it's nearly impossible to create a stable control system for use in a consumer environment. If the temperature in the pipes shift, your system probably doesn't notice for 2-3 secs and then spends the next 6-7 sec oscillating towards a compensated value - at which point something changes again and you're back in that loop. If you wanted to create a hot-cold water control that worked the way you want, you have to start with water that is precisely controlled for temperature/pressure so that it always delivers the same amount at the shower head. That eliminates the need for a feedback loop with temperature/pressure sensors and you'd simply be able to dial in a temperature and keep it there. Obviously, they can do this in industry. But for your average consumer, redoing the plumbing in their house to accommodate such precision doesn't have enough value-add over simply using mechanical controls to vary the hot/cold mix manually.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 45.4, 'recall': 34.5, 'fmeasure': 39.21}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.09, 'recall': 6.14, 'fmeasure': 6.98}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.84, 'recall': 16.59, 'fmeasure': 18.86}}"
Is it cheaper to automate processes than to outsource them to cheap labour?,"Yes, automation is generally cheaper than outsourcing to cheap labor. The cost of automation is typically the cost of the hardware and software needed to automate the process. The cost of outsourcing to cheap labor is the cost of labor, which can vary depending on the location. There are also other costs to consider, such as the cost of training the workers, and the cost of traveling to the location of the workers. Automation is generally cheaper because it doesn't require the same level of training, and it doesn't require travel. Automation is also faster, and it can be done with fewer workers. Automation is generally more efficient than outsourcing to cheap labor. Automation is faster, and it can be done with fewer workers. Automation is also more efficient than outsourcing to cheap labor because it doesn't require the same level of training, and it doesn't require travel. Automation is also more consistent than outsourcing to cheap labor, because it doesn't depend on the quality of the workers. Automation is also more reliable than outsourcing to cheap labor, because it doesn't depend on the quality of the workers. Automation is also more scalable than outsourcing to cheap labor, because it doesn't depend on the quality of the workers.  ","It really depends on the product, the process and the size of the run. If you are trying to perhaps, bottle beer, or box cereal, a simple, constant product and process, automation makes sense if demand is high. You really don't want workers putting bottles of beer in six pack holders all day, and then placing them into cartons. On the other hand, if you are making short run products, 100 of these, 50 of those, then automation becomes less important and flexibility becomes more important. For example, if you only make 20 jet engines a week, but the engines are of four different types than only certain aspects can be automated. However, if you want to eliminate unskilled labor, like fork lift drives, box closers, packagers, assemblers, and demand for the product will exist for a long period of time, then automation becomes cheaper than unskilled labor. This question is probably best answered using the concept of 'Net Present Value', which is essentially the value of future cash flows in 'today's money'. It is calculated by reducing ('discounting') future cash-flows (cash money after all costs) by a certain rate that reflects the cost of borrowing money from somewhere *and then* deducting your initial investment cost (the cost of buying your machinery or equipment used in producing a good or service) from this. This can give you and objective 'value' of a project in today's money and can be compared with other projects to see which is best. In the short-term, outsourcing is often cheaper as automation involves an up-front investment (called 'Capital Expenditure'). If the cost of this investment is not recouped by future cash-flows from producing and selling your good or service, then the same project offering short-term cost savings by outsourcing costs of production could be a more attractive alternative. In the longer-term however, the cost savings made by automating production often outweigh the initial investment as the project has longer to recoup that initial investment and the cost savings (particularly wage costs in developed economies) tend to significant. This is a generalization, and is dependent on a number of factors (such as average wage costs, tax rates, depreciation rates, residual value of the machinery, the labour intensivity of producing your goods) but is a key reason why so many manufacturers in developed economies have either turned to automation (e.g. Japanese Car Industry) or a combination of automation and 'offshoring' (moving production to a foreign country) (e.g. Nike's production of shoes in Asia). If you are interested, this scenario can be compared through using a 'discount cash-flow' (DCF) model (there are plenty of explanations of how this can be done on youtube). Good to finally use my Finance Degree for something other than answering emails! In my experience it is enormously cheaper to outsource because there is zero investment. To automate requires capital investment for machines and time to switch over which is itself downtime. There are still vast populations willing to work for peanuts compared to Americans.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 50.7, 'recall': 21.21, 'fmeasure': 29.9}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.21, 'recall': 4.68, 'fmeasure': 6.6}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.72, 'recall': 9.92, 'fmeasure': 13.99}}"
Why do solar panels expire?,"Solar panels don't actually expire, they just get less efficient over time. It's a gradual process and it can be slowed down by cleaning the panels and by using better quality materials. There are two main reasons why solar panels become less efficient over time. The first reason is that the materials used to make the solar panels degrade over time. The second reason is that the solar panels become less efficient because they get dirty. The solar panels are covered in a thin layer of dust and dirt that reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches the solar cells. If you clean the solar panels regularly, they will last longer. You can also use a special cleaning solution to make the solar panels last longer. The panels are made of a material called silicon. Silicon is a very good conductor of electricity, and it's also very cheap. This makes it the ideal material for solar panels. However, silicon is not a very good material for solar panels. It's very cheap, but it's also very brittle. The solar panels are made of many layers of silicon, and these layers can crack over time. This means that the solar panels can become less efficient over time. There are many different types of solar panels, but they all work in the same way.  ","I don't think they expire like food. However, the 'active' parts that do the job of converting light to electrical energy are very thin and fragile. They eventually degrade and fail. Like anything they suffer from ware and tear. This results in loss of productivity (eg solar cells dying, the glass getting worn and becoming more opaque, etc). Companies tend to guarantee that a certain % of output will remain after a period (typically 80% after 20-25 years I think).

They are more expensive and more difficult to use. #2 pencils are made of softer wood and are used for most everyday writing.

If you get into art or mechanical drawing, you will be exposed to different hardnesses of leads. That's the type used for writing in school and all the other types of pencil are primarily for art or other niche purposes (architecture drafting, etc). When scantron tests became so widespread, it wouldn't work with lighter pencils so they mandated the dark #2. This led to #2 pencils being pretty much exclusively sold except for art stores. It has to do with the hardness of the lead. Harder pencils write really nicely, and don't smudge, but as a byproduct they also don't erase very well. Also if it's too sharp or your paper is too thin it'll just punch through the paper. Softer pencils write really pretty and smudge in an artistic way. It's a great asset to apply shading and wipe effects. However, that means they will smudge for no reason, which makes for a shitty drawing if you don't know what you're doing. Number 2 pencils are just right. They write and erase well, and resist smudging on a clean hand. True!

What happens when a generator is running but no load is being applied?,"/u/mr_sandman_915 is spot on, but I want to add a bit more context. The generator is essentially a motor, and it's a special type of motor that runs on AC (alternating current) instead of DC (direct current). When a generator is running but no load is being applied, it's essentially running in a ""self-excited"" mode. This means that the generator is creating its own magnetic field, and it's using that magnetic field to drive the current. The magnetic field is created by the rotor, which is the rotating part of the generator. The rotor is made up of a lot of tiny magnets that are arranged in a special pattern. As the rotor rotates, it's creating a rotating magnetic field, and that's what drives the current. The generator has a special circuit that's designed to detect when the current is being used by a load, and when it's not being used, the circuit reduces the amount of power that the generator is producing. This is done by reducing the amount of current that's being produced, and it's done in a way that's controlled by the generator itself. When the generator is running but no load is being applied, the generator is producing a certain amount of power, and that power is being dissipated as heat.  ","> Is electricity still being made? Yes. There's voltage, but no current. Static electricity is a different example of accumulation of potential without a load. Voltage is sometimes called ""potential"" because it *could* make current flow if a load is connected. Since no load is connected, no current is flowing and no electric *power* is generated. Power is voltage times current. Short answer: with no load generator is easier to turn. It gets more difficult to turn (and takes more energy) as the load increases. essentially it has to do with inductive reactance in the coils of the generator. in simple terms, a magnetic field moving near a conductor will induce an electric potential within that conductor. when the generator is spinning with no load you still have electromotive force (voltage) but no current flows and in an ideal generator no *power* is produced. P = VI (ohms law). The amount of torque required to spin the generator's rotor is proportional to the amount of load. the more load the more *work* to spin the rotor one revolution. The rotor will be ""easier"" to turn with no load. Its all physics. so you have basically an electromagnetic coil spinning inside of some other coils, and really a generator is not much different than an electric motor (in fact many types of AC motors will function as generators, producing a voltage when you spin them while *off*) current flowing through a coil of wire produces a magnetic field and the north pole will attract the south pole of another magnet. With alternating current the polarity reverses cyclicly so when the rotor poles gets close to the stator coils, the direction of current flow and thus the magnetic poles reverse so they dont just get close to each other and stick (3 phase AC is really useful here). If you spin the rotor and attach a load instead of a current source, a rotating magnetic field is produced, which induced an AC voltage in the coils. (the term AC voltage just made me wonder, alternating *current*, well thats just what its called i guess) The rest is a lot of physics, and math. Basically a lot of electrical engineering technical shit that hopefully somebody that knows more about it than me can explain in elegant simple terms that ur average person thats not an electrical engineer or can understand; I'm a computer science student but I dont know everything about electrical circuits (but wants to know everything there is to know about everything), especially when it's not digital logic.

Why are cars that use automatic transmission less energy efficient than those that use manual transmission?,"1. The energy loss is from friction. In an automatic transmission, the engine has to drive the transmission, and then the transmission has to drive the wheels.   engine drives the wheels directly. This means that there is less friction, which means less energy lost. 2.   engine has to be running at a lower speed, which means that the engine is more efficient.   engine is only running at the speed that it needs to be running at, which means that it is more efficient. 3.   engine has to be running at a lower speed, which means that the engine is more efficient.   engine is only running at the speed that it needs to be running at, which means that it is more efficient. 4.   engine has to be running at a lower speed, which means that the engine is more efficient.   engine is only running at the speed that it needs to be running at, which means that it is more efficient. 5.   engine has to be running at a lower speed, which means that the engine is more efficient.   engine is only running at the speed that it needs to be running at, which means that it is more efficient. 6.  ","For the most part, this is no longer true, fuel economy is a usually a wash between a stick and an automatically. It used to be true, because: * automatics weren't as good as humans at deciding when to shift * automatics were often sold with fewer gears * automatics added weight to the car The technology for automatic transmissions have improved to the these are no longer big factors, and some automatics now get a little better mileage. Automatic transmissions are less efficient than manual transmissions because they use a torque converter to exchange the power of the engine to the forward motion of the car. A torque converter works much like two fans facing towards each other where one is blowing and one is not. The energy from the blowing fan makes the non-blowing fan turn. Anyway, it is a less efficient process than using a clutch in a car to transfer the engine power to the forward motion of the car because there is less energy wasted. An automatic transmission tries to get you on the appropriate gear for your speed and acceleration without your input, but it is controlled very specifically, so if you do a lot of speeding up or slowing down, it can jump you up or down a gear multiple times, giving you less than optimal gas mileage. On a manual transmission, as long as you don't screw up, you can stay on the same gear even if you have to slow down a little, allowing a more consistent fuel consumption.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 29.85, 'recall': 23.26, 'fmeasure': 26.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.5, 'recall': 4.28, 'fmeasure': 4.81}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 16.42, 'recall': 12.79, 'fmeasure': 14.38}}"
Why do American school busses not have flat fronts?," Painted with a flat front and red and yellow striped down the side. It’s a bus, not a car.

If you’re a kid on a bike, you’ll see it from far away, and you’ll have plenty of time to get out of the way. If you’re a pedestrian, you’ll see it from far away, and you’ll have plenty of time to get out of the way. And if you’re a cyclist, you’ll see it from far away, and you’ll have plenty of time to get out of the way. It’s big, it’s red, it’s yellow, and it’s coming for you. The design is not just to be aesthetically pleasing. The design is to be functional and safe. The bus is designed to be easy to see from a distance. It has a high profile and is painted bright red and yellow to make it stand out. The school bus has a high profile, meaning that it has a large front end and a large back end. This design allows the bus to be seen from a distance.  ","Some do. As to the visibility, most school busses have an arm that automatically swings open from the front of the bus to force a walk forward to get around it. Also, most bus routes are built to have the children not crossing the street if possible. For starters, most school buses with a nose are older models. Flat front designs are fairly modern. A lot of school districts simply can't afford to update their models to the newer version/ it's cheaper to buy the older design. Secondly there are somewhat naive concerns with flat front buses due to where the engine is located. Having under the kids = parents are afraid of engine problems harming their children. Finally, and this ties into the first point, it's easier to make sure the fleet stays homogeneous for repair purposes and for aesthetic reasons.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 22.22, 'recall': 36.11, 'fmeasure': 27.51}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.86, 'recall': 6.29, 'fmeasure': 4.79}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 12.82, 'recall': 20.83, 'fmeasure': 15.87}}"
"What do 'Space Coordinates' look like?

(2) Keeping track of the actual spacecraft position while the mission is in flight; this is the work of orbit determination. And (3) creating maneuvers to bring the spacecraft back to the reference trajectory when it has strayed; this is the area of flight path control. It's not just ""coordinates"" for the destination, but which of he infinite number of paths between the two points you want the craft to follow. Since stopping is as hard as getting going, they tend to work in terms of loops. Try playing kerbal space, it will give you a really good idea of how orbital mechanics and space flight works They're calculating how much velocity they need to send the rocket to its target, when to launch it or perform other maneuvers, and the exact direction to point. All of this is managed using what's called inertial guidance. Inertial guidance is a system that calculates an object's (in this case a spacecraft) speed, direction, and location by remembering the starting values and making changes based on those initial values. It keeps track of it's orientation using roll, pitch, and yaw, so for example if the rocket started with a pitch, roll, and yaw of 0 degrees, and then pitched up 40 degrees and later down 10 degrees, it would know it's at 30 degrees. Same applies to velocity. Essentially those are the only things the rocket itself needs to know to get where it's going: Which direction to point, and how much thrust to apply in that direction.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.4, 'recall': 11.67, 'fmeasure': 19.61}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.71, 'recall': 2.01, 'fmeasure': 3.38}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 36.84, 'recall': 7.0, 'fmeasure': 11.76}}"

If you're standing next to the track and you see a train coming, it's going to be a lot louder than you expect, and you'll feel a rush of wind. It's the same reason that a car horn is so loud.

The sections have a small gap to the nearby sections to electrically isolate the sections from each other. The two tracks are also isolated from each other. Each section then have a small voltage applied across the tracks in addition to the main supply. When a train moves over the track it short circuits the tracks. This will then be able to trigger relays in the crossings to close the gates and control the signals. The simplest crossing is just a yellow light that is lit when it is safe to cross, this light is just hooked up directly to the rails. The crossing (lights/gate) relay is always powered. The train shorts this power to ground causing the (lights/gate) relay to de-energize. Once this happens the normally open contacts of the relay close powering the lights and or gate.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 33.33, 'recall': 25.0, 'fmeasure': 28.57}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.64, 'recall': 2.72, 'fmeasure': 3.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.82, 'recall': 14.86, 'fmeasure': 16.99}}"
Why Moor's law saying that amount of transistors will double every two years. And that is about how it goes. Why it is so linear?,"Moor's Law was a prediction made by Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Intel, in 1965. It was a prediction that the number of transistors on a microchip would double about every two years, leading to exponential improvements in computing power. This prediction has proven to be remarkably accurate over the years, with the number of transistors on a chip doubling every 18 months.   reason for this is due to the way in which the transistors are built.   transistors are built on a silicon chip, which is made up of tiny transistors. Each transistor has three terminals (source, drain, and gate), and each terminal is connected to a tiny wire. In order to make the transistors smaller, the wires must be made smaller.   way in which the wires are made smaller is by using a process called lithography. Lithography is a process in which a beam of light is used to create a pattern on the silicon chip. This pattern is then used to create the tiny transistors on the chip.   process of lithography is repeated over and over again, with the wires becoming smaller and smaller each time. This is the reason for the exponential growth in computing power.   transistors are getting smaller and smaller, and the number of transistors on a chip is increasing rapidly.  ","The processor industry chose to use Moore's law as a goal to achieve, so they managed to achieve it. By doing so they are able to design chips and circuits knowing how many transistors they will have available before the technology to make that circuit exists. There's no actual law, it's just what the industry has strived for. That being said, Moore's law is soon to meet it's end. We are running into physical limits, as in transistors are reaching the size of dozens of atoms, and we can only get so much smaller. Advancements will shift to new materials allowing faster clockspeeds, more efficient circuit designs, etc. It isn't linear, it's an exponential growth. It might look linear if you're looking at a logarithmic plot. An [article]( URL_0 ) from Investopedia: > Because Moore's law suggests exponential growth, it is unlikely to continue indefinitely. Most experts expect Moore's law to hold for another two decades. Some studies have shown physical limitations could be reached by 2017. The extension of Moore's law is that computers, machines that run on computers, and computing power all become smaller and faster with time, as transistors on integrated circuits become more efficient. Transistors are simple electronic on/off switches embedded in microchips, processors and tiny electrical circuits. The faster microchips process electrical signals, the more efficient a computer becomes. Costs of these higher-powered computers eventually came down as well, usually about 30 percent per year. When designers increased the performance of computers with better integrated circuits, manufacturers were able to create better machines that could automate certain processes. This automation created lower-priced products for consumers, as the hardware created lower labor costs.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 33.49, 'recall': 25.17, 'fmeasure': 28.74}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.15, 'recall': 3.11, 'fmeasure': 3.56}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.68, 'recall': 11.03, 'fmeasure': 12.6}}"

The jet will use full reverse thrust for nearly the entirety of the stop; they also have anti-lock brakes to prevent too much skidding, so whatever stopping power the brakes can add is used to the fullest. For the most part, a runway is kept as clear as possible with plowing + de-icer so the plane is really just landing on a wet runway. To the guy who says that 'no tire can be expected to provide traction,' jets have to be certified to stop entirely without reverse thrust (on a dry runway) and many airports restrict the use of reverse thrust for noise consideration. Reverse thrust will decrease stopping distance by 20% or so, it doesn't do the whole job. Because the tires and brakes on a 737 aren't really expected to grip all that much, they just provide a buffer between the fuselage and ground. Most of the stopping force is extended airflow speedbrakes and reverse thrust.

How does Solar Power convert energy from the sun to electrical power?," Sounds like you're asking about how the sun's energy is converted to electricity. Well, the sun is a massive ball of hot gas, mostly hydrogen and helium. As the sun's gas is heated by nuclear reactions, the gas expands. This expansion of gas causes the sun to spin faster and faster, creating electric currents in the gas. These electric currents are then converted into electricity by special machines called generators, which are connected to the solar panels. The machines are called generators because they generate electricity from the sun's energy.","The PV cell has what's called a p-n junction of two semi-conducting materials layered next to each other. Semi-conductors, as the name suggests, are able to conduct electricity but do not do so all of the time, unlike regular conductors like copper and aluminium. Instead a semi-conductor requires a little 'nudge' in order to become conductive, and depending on what it's made from, that nudge may come in the form of enough heat, enough voltage or - as with a PV cell - enough light. The p-n junction is made up of a positive and a negative layer; you can think of the negative layer as having an excess number of electrons that it is looking to get rid of, and the positive layer as having an excess number of 'holes' that it's looking to fill. When the energy contained in sunlight hits the negative layer, it provides enough energy for the electrons to jump the gap across the junction, thus allowing electricity to flow around the circuit","{'rouge1': {'precision': 35.11, 'recall': 18.97, 'fmeasure': 24.63}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.15, 'recall': 1.16, 'fmeasure': 1.5}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 22.34, 'recall': 12.07, 'fmeasure': 15.67}}"
"What Americans mean when they say their infrastructure is crumbling. Which parts of US infrastructure are broken, and why were they allowed to go defunct?","The ""infrastructure"" of the United States refers to the systems that allow for the functioning of the country. It includes things like the roads, bridges, railways, electrical grid, water supply, sewage systems, and airports. These systems are all owned by the government, and are maintained by the government. The US government is notorious for underfunding the infrastructure, and many of the systems are in disrepair. For example, the roads are often in disrepair, and the bridges are often unsafe. The water supply is often contaminated, and the airports are overcrowded. In some areas, the sewage system is so bad that sewage backups are common. The US has a system of taxation that allows for the government to collect money from its citizens, and use that money to pay for the infrastructure. However, the government does not always collect enough money to pay for the infrastructure. This is because the taxation system is not designed to collect enough money, and because the government is often corrupt and spends the money on other things. For example, the government may spend money on wars, or on bribing politicians. The government is also often corrupt, and will spend money on things that are not necessary.  ","Roads are probably biggest example. Major highways get much of their funding from per gallon taxes on gas. But the federal gas tax hasn't been raised since 1993 and many states haven't raised theirs in years either. So with inflation and increased fuel efficiency of cars, there just isn't as much money available for maintaining highways. In Michigan, they're closing a section of a major highway into Detroit for 2 years so they can do major repairs of a bridge. The bridge had gotten so bad that holes in the road were going all the way through and concrete was falling down onto roads underneath. So in this case, it is literally crumbling. In 2003, some tree branches falling on power lines in Ohio caused a blackout that affected over 50 million people. In my city, the rail cars used in the public transit system are 30+ years old and there are no current plans or funds available to replace them. The current fleet is kept running by salvaging parts from broken trains. Over the past few years, the state has cut funding for public transit, leading to reductions in bus and rail service. A significant part of the problem, not yet mentioned, is that the U.S. had a binge of infrastructure building in the early and middle of the twentieth century. But that created a huge amount of infrastructure that then had to be maintained, a costly consequence that seems not to have been considered at the time. In many states, the funds typically used for infrastructure repair come from a general fund and tend to get redirected to other issues. Lawmakers tend to do this because maintaining roads is boring and gets relatively little praise even though it's very important. A prime example is a set of bridges in Rhode Island. One bridge is maintained totally with tolls collected from drivers who travel over the bridge. It's in really good shape and always has been. The other bridge never had tolls and was maintained by the state department of transportation. It had to be replaced due to safety reasons about halfway through it's projected lifespan because it wasn't properly maintained. While lawmakers thought they could get away with deferring maintenance on the bridge they ended up spending many times the ""saved"" amount building a new bridge. Roads, Bridges, Phones, Power, Water, etc. All the infrastructure is decaying. As to why? Government not wanting to spend money on it, and private companies not doing so. There is not a single category of infrastructure in America where the majority of the country is not in bad shape. Roads, bridges, electrical grid etc. Probably the largest reason is that those public works have always been sold to the public and funded solely on construction costs, with nothing in place for upkeep/repair/replacement. Those costs are huge, and no one in government wants to be the one to require the increase in taxes or decrease in others services needed to fund it. So the can gets kicked down the road until a bridge collapses, and then funding is approved as emergency. As an example, here is a report on structurally deficient bridges from 2016. URL_0 During the depression, the president put a huge income tax in place. I don't want to pretend like I have current money equivalent. If ya made 10k a year it was a small percent 50k or over it was higher 100k it was higher.... If you made more than 100k.... The NEXT 50k you made had a MUCH higher bracket... Kinda like that...but the first 10k was taxed the smallest, even for the wealthy... Well when america's good guy, actor, and already very wealthy man with very wealthy friends became president....he stopped that and changed the tax code.... Basically....the money that the government got from the taxes on the very wealthy went to making sewers, roads, bridges, railroads, power grids....etc....and also put many of the unemployed to work, while also bringing basic utilities to nearly everywhere, which fixed a lot of sanitation issues, which means there were less sick people, less poor people, less people living in harsh conditions, and the country blossomed. The basic idea was that (to put in current terms) who the heck needs MORE than a million dollars a year to live comfortably? NOBODY who isn't doing stupid and ridiculous things like buying a gold plated airplane? But when already rich actor became president, he struck all that down and declared that if the rich guys have more money, they will spend more money and that money will slowly and eventually make the poor man have more money. But now we all know that isn't and hasn't worked and we are at the point now that many of these roads, bridges, pipes....are rotting and we don't have money to fix them. This is basically a consequence of the United States' extreme tendency for privatisation. Phone lines, railways, some roads, and other public necessities are often sold off to private for-profit companies, which aren't required to really act in the public interest so long as the service is provided. Likewise, the government isn't interested in fixing the problem, because any solution would take years to implement- by which time it's a different government's issue. So, the politicians ignore it beyond bandaid solutions, because they won't be around to get the credit for the job. One thing not mentioned here is the lobbying by businesses who have an interest in one thing or another. The trucking & tire industries lobby to limit railway funding at the expense of the public good. I am sure there are other examples, but the famous one is General Motors [killing streetcars in San Fransisco]( URL_0 ). Currently 1 in 4 bridges in the US are either functionally obsolete or structurally deficient. That places people that travel over them at an unacceptable risk of injury / death should an event like the I-35 Bridge collapse in Minneapolis. Bridges typically have a design life of 50 years. Government has ignored the fact that bridges are going to need replacement and thus haven't funded for such.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 69.65, 'recall': 13.3, 'fmeasure': 22.33}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.0, 'recall': 3.42, 'fmeasure': 5.75}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.33, 'recall': 6.55, 'fmeasure': 11.0}}"

"How can Motorcycles hit and maintain ~10,000 RPM's, whereas my 6 speed car feels like it's about to fall apart at 7500?","There are several reasons. First, most motorcycles have a much smaller engine than most cars. Motorcycles usually have engines that are less than 1/3 the size of a car engine. This means that the motorcycle engine is spinning much faster than the car engine to produce the same amount of power. This is because the motorcycle engine is designed to be more efficient than a car engine. The motorcycle engine is designed to produce more power for its size than a car engine, which means that it can produce more power for a given amount of fuel. Second, the motorcycle engine is designed to be much more compact than a car engine. This means that the motorcycle engine can fit in a much smaller space, which makes the motorcycle lighter. This means that the motorcycle can accelerate and brake faster than a car. This is important for motorcycles because motorcycles are much smaller than cars and are much more agile.   make much tighter turns than cars. Finally, the motorcycle engine is designed to produce more torque than a car engine. This means that the motorcycle engine can produce more power at lower engine speeds. This means that the motorcycle can accelerate faster than a car. This is important for motorcycles because motorcycles are much smaller than cars and are much more agile.  ","Stroke length - the distance from the bottom on the cylinder to the top- plays a huge part of this. The shorter the distance the less speed the piston has to have and the less rotational G force applied to the piston. 80's indy cars had over bore engines that could turn over 18k rpm. Meaning the diameter of the piston is most larger than the stroke of the crank. (Rod length that connects the two makes no difference in piston speed, but on side load it does. Totally different subject) Stroke is torque, rpm is horsepower. Indy cars going around a track don't need much torque because horsepower carries them around a track more efficiently. A street car uses torque to take off from a stop and gain better fuel economy. A motorcycle doesn't have the wieght disadvantages a car has. So they don't need the tq a car has. If you need any more technical data and math to go with this I can supply it. General rule is basically: longer the cylinder stroke is, slower the max rpm. Longer cylinder stroke means cylinder moves more per revolution compared to shorter stroke. Also forces and accelerations endured by cylinder are higher. That is why car engines have usually lower max rpm than a motorcycle. Ship engines run with much lower rpm and rc car engine can run over 20000rpm. I like to use the analogy of a twig. Take a long twig and apply a force to each end in compression. The twig will bow the break. However take a twig the is shorter and it will require more force to break. The same logic applies to the connecting rods in the cylinders of the motor. Motorcycles tend to have short strokes. My FZ-1 has 1000cc of displacement but only travels 58mm or 2.28in. That is a pretty small stroke and keeps bikes connecting rods acting like the short twig. Smaller engines have shorter piston strokes, essentially. If you've ever watched a Formula 1 race, you've observed that the cars have a high pitched whine, like motorcycles, despite being 8 or 10 cylinder engines. Same principle at work. If you looked at the *actual speed* the parts inside the engine are traveling and also the acceleration as they change direction, they may be *relatively* similar. Because the smaller engine parts travel shorter distances each cycle, they are (potentially) not moving faster in absolute terms. A motorcycle engine may be built to withstand higher forces for performance reasons but in short, it actually doesn't need to be.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.64, 'recall': 23.85, 'fmeasure': 31.56}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.76, 'recall': 3.45, 'fmeasure': 4.57}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.63, 'recall': 10.55, 'fmeasure': 13.96}}"
the difference between the dam in Oroville failing versus the spillway failing. Or any city dam/spillway.,A spillway is a dam that is designed to fail. It is designed to release water in case the water level in the reservoir gets too high. The spillway is designed to be able to handle the amount of water that would be released if the dam failed. The spillway is designed to be able to handle the amount of water that would be released if the dam failed. The spillway is designed to be able to handle the amount of water that would be released if the dam failed.,"The dam itself is made of a single comparatively thin vertical core wall of concrete and clay reinforced on both sides by enormous amounts of earth (40,000+ trainloads worth that took eleven years to move). This structure is strong enough to hold back the enormous pressure being exerted by the water in the main channel, however it is NOT designed to be overtopped. If water flows over the dam proper, it would cut a channel through it like a knife through butter, all the way down to the natural river bed. [As enormous as the artificial dam is, it is still much thinner than the hills surrounding it.]( URL_0 ) Which is where the spillway is. As bad as the erosion is on the spillway (and it is bad), it is still happening at a rate MUCH slower than if the dam itself was overtopped. The Dam holds back all of the water. The main spillway is to the left of the dam wall itself. It is an entirely different structure from the dam. It is where all of the water is supposed to go, since the main spillway has a nice concrete chute for all the water to go down. Weee!!! The emergency spillway is a 30 foot tall wall built even further to the left of the main spillway, built as a last-resort just-in-case thing to prevent water from EVER going over the dam itself. If the emergency spillway were to fail, up to 30 feet of water would drain into the Feather River uncontrollably. If the dam would fail, about 770 feet of water would drain into the river uncontrollably. Fortunately the emergency spillway has stopped flowing now that the main spillway has increased its output. TLDR/ELI5 timeline from my POV is: Cracks filled in 3 years ago, not fixed, floods caused re-failure of spillway few days ago, they reduced overflow through spillway to prolong lifespan, this action now compromised whole dam as it's overflowing an emergency spillway (never used in 50 year history of the dam) and also the overflow of the overflow (aka a car park) and only getting worse as more rain is scheduled. This water simply removes top soil and loose rock, destabilising the walls of the dam above it, causing them to collapse if this continues. If rain stops, you're lucky. If not, it's gone. Hence they are evacuating because they know this is the truth.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 64.44, 'recall': 14.04, 'fmeasure': 23.06}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 24.72, 'recall': 5.34, 'fmeasure': 8.78}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 45.56, 'recall': 9.93, 'fmeasure': 16.3}}"
Why is the United States' infrastructure in such disarray?," & #x200B; I think the short answer is that we've been neglecting it for a while.

How can the Oroville Dam is overflowing when California is experiencing a prolonged drought?,"The dam is overflowing because the rain is more than the dam can hold. It's not a question of how much water the dam can hold, but how much rain is coming in. California is in a drought, but that doesn't mean it's not raining anywhere in California. It's just that the rain isn't going into the reservoirs that feed the dams.","[This nice graphic]( URL_0 ) shows the status of the reservoirs relative to their capacity and normal level. This shows surface water not in drought conditions. The time to refill the underground aquifers is much longer. Drought is an extended period of lower-than-normal rainfall. It doesn't mean that it never rains. Think of it this way. If you stop eating, and only have one meal every four days at an all-you-can-eat buffet, you are still malnourished. In the last two months, much of California has received significantly more rainfall in a shorter amount of time than average. This results in a lot of surface water pooling in some reservoirs and leading to floods. You can see a weekly layout of the California drought over the past five years here: URL_0 Notice the last row of entries. California stopped being in drought conditions two months ago when massive storms started raining on most of the State. The Dam is overflowing because it rained so much that it filled the Dam, then rained so much that the primary spillway was not able to handle it and the secondary ""emergency"" spillways which are earthen are also not handling the volume of water and are failing (may have failed by this point).

Where does water pressure come from?,"Water pressure comes from gravity. Water is heavy, and it's also very dense. So when you put water into a pipe, it wants to stay where it is, and it's going to fight the force of gravity. But gravity is a lot stronger than water, so the water loses, and it starts to flow downwards. The more water you put into the pipe, the more water you have to fight gravity with, so the more water pressure you get.","I'll just try to elaborate a bit. There are only 2 common ways to increase the pressure of any fluid (including water). Pressure is equal to the density of the liquid times the height, it doesn't matter how wide or deep the pipe is, the water pressure at the bottom of a 2 inch diameter tube that's 100 feet tall will be the same as a 2000 inch diameter tube that is 100 feet tall. So water is either collected at high elevation (rain collecting) or pumped to a higher elevation (tank at the top of a tower). Pumping is the second method to increase pressure, which is pretty obvious, using electrical power, to turn mechanical parts that apply force to the fluid to increase pressure.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 32.1, 'recall': 20.16, 'fmeasure': 24.76}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.25, 'recall': 3.91, 'fmeasure': 4.81}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.99, 'recall': 13.18, 'fmeasure': 16.19}}"

"Why are cab-over trucks virtually non-existent in the US, but used almost exclusively in other countries?","The cab-over engine is a compromise between a forward-mounted engine and a rear-mounted engine. The cab-over engine is a compromise that is rarely seen in the US, because the US has a culture of large pickups. The cab-over engine is smaller than the rear-mounted engine, but it is not as efficient as the forward-mounted engine. In a pickup, the cab-over engine is not as efficient as the rear-mounted engine, because the cab-over engine is not as aerodynamic. In a truck, the cab-over engine is not as efficient as the rear-mounted engine, because the cab-over engine is not as aerodynamic. The cab-over engine is also not as powerful as the rear-mounted engine, because the cab-over engine is not as powerful. The cab-over engine is not as powerful because the cab-over engine is smaller than the rear-mounted engine, and it is not as powerful because it is not as efficient. The cab-over engine is also not as powerful because it is not as efficient.   it is not as aerodynamic.   it is not as powerful. The cab-over engine is not as powerful because it is not as efficient.  ","The USA is a spacious country. Design trade-offs that reduce the truck's length are not as valuable when you have lots of room. And the USA is a large enough market to have its own truck designs. Note that other very spacious countries (Australia, Canada) also have lots of non-cab-over trucks. Cab-over trucks are shorter, and so more useful in countries who have bad/small road systems. But the tradeoff is that you have bad aerodynamics and use more fuel to drive. The US is spacious and designed for car and truck travel with larger roads. This means that we can have the longer, more aerodynamic models for our truck which will operate more efficiently. We have max total length of 25 meters and 64 metric tonnes here, so a cab-over makes room for a lot of cargo. In the US, the weight limit is less and only the trailer is limited in length. It has nothing to do with power or aerodynamics. To add to the other disadvantages mentioned, cab-over trucks are less safe for the driver, because they are closer to the point of impact in a crash and not protected by the engine. I think cab-over trucks are still quite safe in crashes compared to small cars, but this is just one of many small reasons to avoid cab-overs if space constraints don't make them necessary. Countries have limits on the size of trucks. In the US, the length limit is on the trailers. In the EU, the length limit is on the trailers plus the cab. So in the EU, it's better to have shorter cabs, because every extra foot you put in the cab is a foot you can't use for revenue-generating cargo space. In the US, if you make the cab a couple of feet longer, you don't have to make the trailer shorter. A lot of countries have more restrictions on the overall length of the vehicle. Even if there is no legal restrictions there are tighter corners and smaller intersections on the roads which makes it hard to maneuver a long truck. A cab-over have the advantage of being shorter but have more drag. This helps close maneuvering but have higher fuel consumption on the open road. Another difference is that lorries with trailers are more common outside of the states. The lorry might have the same size frame as a standard American tractor but with a short cab-over there is room for a cargo room on the chassis where the fifth wheel usually goes. Then there is a shorter trailer behind that. This have the disadvantage of having to uncouple the trailer when you want to unload the cargo and not being able to quickly move the cargo to another truck. However you can get more room in a more maneuverable vehicle. American trucks on the other hand is going the other way and is adding long trailers to their already long 18 wheeler which makes it hard to maneuver and almost impossible to back up. However this is nothing compared to the Australian road trains that are able to pull lots of trailers after each other but need special turning circles and only drive on straight roads.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.17, 'recall': 16.46, 'fmeasure': 23.98}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.78, 'recall': 3.26, 'fmeasure': 4.76}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.13, 'recall': 10.85, 'fmeasure': 15.81}}"
"Why do products have such seemingly arbitrary numbers and letters? What goes into the naming convention? E.g ""HP Pavilion 15-bc200"" or ""Sony Bravia KD-55XD8505"".",It's called [Trademarking]( URL_0 ). It's the process of protecting your brand name by registering it as a trademark. It's the same as copyrighting a book or song. The letters and numbers are just a way to uniquely identify the brand. It's a way to make sure that only the company that owns the trademark can use that name.,"This will vary by manufacturer and product, so there's no general answer. It's safe to assume the digits and letters represent features and options within a model series. I can give one example that makes sense and is specific to Taylor acoustic guitars, e.g. 514CE-N. First digit: 500 series. Second digit: Number of strings and type of top wood. ""1"" is 6 / softwood. ""2"" is 6 / hardwood. ""5"" is 12 / softwood. ""6"" is 12 / hardwood. Third digit: Size. Dreadnought, concert, orchestra, etc. If the ""C"" is there the guitar has a cutaway on the treble side of the upper frets. If the ""E"" is there the guitar is acoustic / electric. If the ""N"" is there it's a nylon classical. So something like 256E will be 200 series 12 string spruce symphony electric. Assuming that one really exists. Usually it just denotes that items position in a lineup, what features it has, what generation of product it is, and so on. The naming i s arbitrary unless you know what those numbers and letters mean, which is usually why they have a marketable name out in front, like Bravia. The rest is technical. Because Sony makes a shittone of Bravia TVs and calling them all the same thing would lead to confusion. Look, per Sony's website there are 21 Bravia TVs and many of those models come in 3 or 4 sizes. So there's potentially 100 different Bravia TVs and that only includes this years models. They've been selling Bravia TVs since 2005 so there's likely thousands of combinations of features and sizes. It might be that the complex model numbers are confusing. In the case of Sony, they DO mean something it's just that the average consumer might not be aware of what they mean. Take your example: KD-55XD8505 KD notes that it's a Bravia TV, as opposed to a Sony camera or something. 55 is the size of the TV. X means it's an 4K Ultra HD screan. D notes the year, in this case D means 2016. 8505 notes the exact panel and features within that size and model year. Generally the nigher the number the more features it'll have. For the informed consumer, this tells them a lot of information about a TV. The average consumer need only know it's a Sony Bravia. This is opposed to Apple's strategy. Look at iPads, there's a world of difference between a gen 1 iPad and a current gen one, but they are all branded the same ""iPad"". If you walk into some backwater electronics store 2 weeks after a new iPad comes out, how do you know it's the new one vs the old one. What if you're buying on Ebay, how can you tell. I'll give you a hint, there's actually a model number there. My iPhone just says ""iPhone"" on the back. If you look at the fine print under it, it says ""model A1533"" I can look that up and know it's a 5s GSM model intended for the North American market. The A1453 is a CDMA intended for the US and Japan, A1457 is for the UK, Europe and the middle east, A1528 is for China and A1530 is for Asia Pacific.

How are engineers able to build subway tunnels under already built infrastructure?,"It depends on the type of tunnel. If it's a subway tunnel, it's built on the surface, then covered with earth and grass, then covered with a layer of concrete, then covered with the subway. If it's a road tunnel, it's built underground, then covered with earth and grass, then covered with a layer of concrete, then covered with the road.","There's loads of technology. The old fashioned and cheap (still used where possible) method is cut and cover. Dig a big trench, build the tunnels and then cover them up. [Here's them doing it in 1861, London for what is now part of the tube]( URL_2 ) [And here's a modern version for a road tunnel in Scandinavia]( URL_3 ) However, for digging under buildings and such there's another technology - tunnel boring machines. [Here's one of the TBMs used in the newest London underground expansion, Crossrail]( URL_1 ) They're basically giant worms pushed by hydraulics. The front head turns slowly, grinding the ground in front. Conveyor systems carry the sludge away. [Little trains]( URL_0 ) bring precast concrete tunnel segments, which are placed against the wall and bolted in place by a giant robot arm. This is pretty efficient, provided the ground is stable. Unfortunately, many large cities are built on river basins or other flat, muddy ground. This requires more advanced techniques. Back in the day (eg Paris metro) they used to freeze the ground by pumping cold liquid through pipes that they pushed in. Then they could excavate a tunnel and build walls before the ground started to melt. A more modern technique is to use a Earth-Pressure-Balance TBM. If you just use a regular TBM ground will just fall down in front of the cutting head, causing a sinkhole above the TBM. In a EPB TBM the cutting head is kept pushed hard against the tunnel head, so that the ground doesn't start caving in. The front of the TBM is sealed, linking seamlessly with the tunnel lining (built from those concrete segments) that the TBM is always assembling as it moves along. Subway tunnels are pretty well mastered nowadays. The main issue is cost control. In the US you're looking at $200-1000 million a km! (Yes, a million dollars a *meter*). Spain on the other hand has managed to build subway systems well below $100 million/km. This is mostly a management/legal problem. Other tunnels can be more difficult though! Highway tunnels are much bigger, so cause more problems. A recent example would be Seattle where the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement tunnel caused sinkholes to open in the city, or Boston's Big Dig which cost billions upon billions above predictions. There's always new innovations as well. One big one is the New Austrian Tunneling method (which is really a collection of good practices) which is particularly applicable in hard rock. This basically uses pretty standard-looking earthworking equipment, the top half of the tunnel is dug first, the rocks natural strength holding up the tunnel. Then spray-concrete is thrown on the roof. After that the second team comes through and digs out the bottom half, concreting that as well. Very carefully. There are big drills that chew rock very slowly, deposit it onto a conveyor belt that takes it out of the tunnel. Right behind them is a similar machine that lays some brand of concrete, reinforcing mesh, and usually a polymer coating. At no time is more than a very little bit of the tunnel exposed without reinforcement. The whole process goes very slowly, and only really vibrates at the surface entrance/exit, which is usually in an industrial area anyway. Basically, we know the math behind the forces that would ruin existing surface structures, and make sure we don't do that. Or if it's unavoidable, you design for the outages too, and build repairs into the budget.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 66.15, 'recall': 7.17, 'fmeasure': 12.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.19, 'recall': 1.84, 'fmeasure': 3.32}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 38.46, 'recall': 4.17, 'fmeasure': 7.52}}"

How can one rocket get over 100 satellites into each of their positions around the Earth?,"The rocket doesn't get to the satellites' positions, it just gets them into orbit around the Earth. Then the satellites use their own engines to move to their final orbits. It's not like the rocket carries the satellites into orbit and then drops them off, it's more like the rocket carries the satellites into space and then they move themselves into orbit.","I'll simplify and just consider two satellites. Their rocket launches them together into a certain orbit, and then the satellites split up and need to get far apart. They can use their own engines or one can get help by the launching rocket. It doesn't require much rocket fuel for one satellite to go ahead of the other. One satellite just has to drop its orbit a tiny bit and it will go faster and has a shorter path, so it will steadily pull ahead of the other one. It's a bit like a racing car taking the inside lane. Once the two satellites are far enough apart, they can get themselves back into matching orbits and they'll stay with one leading the other. It takes a bit more rocket fuel for one satellite to get into a higher orbit than the other. But not too much if you only need say a 50 or 100 km difference. And then the two satellites will be in different orbits and the closest they'll come to each other will be the difference in their orbital heights. But it takes a *lot* of rocket fuel if you want one satellite to tilt its orbit round so it's different to another. This is because the satellites are doing about 7 km per second already, so to deflect that speed north or south requires a big push. So while the multiple satellites launched by a rocket can orbit at different heights or get into different positions around their orbits, they must all stay in nearly the same plane. If you looked at the orbits of just those 100 satellites, it'd be a bit like the rings of Saturn.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 81.54, 'recall': 18.28, 'fmeasure': 29.86}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 20.31, 'recall': 4.5, 'fmeasure': 7.37}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 46.15, 'recall': 10.34, 'fmeasure': 16.9}}"
How do you invent new origami sculptures?,"Origami is a mathematical art form, and as such, there are only a finite number of possible designs. However, the art of origami is to create new designs that are not possible by simply combining existing designs. This is done by using mathematical techniques to create new shapes, or to manipulate existing shapes into new shapes. This is the basic idea behind the ""Origami Zoo"" project. In this project, we create a mathematical model of a set of shapes, and then manipulate the model in various ways to create new shapes. The project is a great way to show how math and art are related, and how math can be used to create new art forms.","Origami experts are artists just like a sculptor who works with marble, they have a vision of the finished work and the knowledge of what needs to be done to achieve it. There is an element of trial and error but for the most part creating new works is based off of previous experiences. As for recording the steps necessary to recreate a new origami design, most people work backwards from a finished work. It's much easier to deconstruct and record, since there will be some folds that were made in error.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 27.59, 'recall': 34.41, 'fmeasure': 30.62}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.0, 'recall': 0.0, 'fmeasure': 0.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 16.38, 'recall': 20.43, 'fmeasure': 18.18}}"
why are american and european electrical outlets different?,"northamerica, southamerica, europe, and asia all use different types of electrical outlets, and there are no obvious reasons why. this has to do with the evolution of electricity in each region. the united states was the first to use 120v, 60hz alternating current (ac) for electricity, and the rest of the world (except for some parts of south america) followed suit. the rest of the world, however, uses 230v, 50hz ac, and the u.s. has never adopted this standard. the reason for this is that the u.s. was the first to use ac, and was the only country to do so for a long time. as a result, it was able to use its own standard for electrical outlets, and it has never changed. europe was the second to adopt ac, but it didn't use the same standard as the u.s. the u.s. and canada used 120v, 60hz ac, while europe used 230v, 50hz ac. the u.s. and canada were both isolated from the rest of the world for a long time, and the u.s. was the only country to use ac for a long time.  ","Because the standards for generating, delivering, and using electricity were developed independently by different countries. This has been discussed several times before. Electrical systems were developed independently with differing choices along the way. Most European systems chose 50 cycles per second. American systems use 60 cycles per second so simple clocks would be wrong even if the voltage were correct. The US uses 110 to 120 volts while others use higher voltages.

Since the negative side is flat, you can place a spring of some sort on that end and not risk it slipping off. Because the positive nub is smaller, it's concentrating the force applied to the back end by the spring onto a smaller area, ensuring good contact on the positive end without needing a second spring. Since there's only one spring, it's a lot simpler to load than if you had two springs pointed opposite directions. Also it's easier to show pictorially that ""the side with the nub goes here"" than ""the positive side goes here"" to someone with zero knowledge of how electronics work or that there are positive and negative charges.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 33.33, 'recall': 21.64, 'fmeasure': 26.24}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.98, 'recall': 4.51, 'fmeasure': 5.48}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.89, 'recall': 19.4, 'fmeasure': 23.53}}"

This is hard enough even when you're not thinking about people putting the device in water. If you want to worry about having the device be submerged, that's an extra layer of precision (and more expensive quality control) that has to go into how the parts fit together that form the outside, as well as things like polymer seals in the places where water could get in (like at the microphone, or between the lens of the camera and the shell). You could just put a special case all the way around a ""normal"" phone but this makes the device bigger and heavier. You also have to make some guesses as to how deep into water the device may go, because the forces involved in submersion are directly proportional to depth. Other guesses need to be made about the possibility of contaminants or solutions in the water that could get stuck or corrode your seals, like naturally occurring acids. There are other possible things to worry about, but it's all another layer of engineering that has to have its own quality control layer, which just increases the complexity of manufacturing. All, for something that most people think is something you should naturally avoid anyways. Of course it's becoming a competitive point for some products these days and the market is always changing.

Why do some cars have gas tanks on the left and others on the right?,"Because the driver's seat is on the right side of the car in the US, so the gas tank is on the right side so that it's easy to fill it up.

There are some cars that have gas tanks on the right side, but that's mainly because the manufacturer decided to do it that way.","It's not that there is a reason they aren't on the same side. It's that there's not a reason to have them on the same side. So each manufacturer dies what's best for their factory and design. Researching this I found a few candidate explanations: The filler cap is on the opposite side to the exhaust pipe. Makes sense that it would reduce the risk of igniting spilled fuel, and it might also be mechanically easier to build. As for which side the exhaust is on, that will be influenced by the engine mounting especially for a transverse engine. If there's a lever in the car on the driver's side to release the filler cap, putting the filler cap on the driver's side too is mechanically simpler. But my own car goes against this - UK model Suzuki, so right hand drive, lever on the floor just next to the driver's door, left hand side filler cap. Probably the car designers just put it where it's easiest, considering the rest of the vehicle. Things like which side the driver sits, a transverse-mounted engine, and certain rear lights all create asymmetries in car design.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 65.69, 'recall': 33.0, 'fmeasure': 43.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.8, 'recall': 9.9, 'fmeasure': 13.2}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.31, 'recall': 17.24, 'fmeasure': 22.95}}"
"Why are we so amazed at what past civilizations created (pyramids, temples, etc) how did we lose the way these types of mega structures were created?","It's not like we lost the way to build them, we just don't build them as frequently or with the same level of resources. We've gotten a lot better at building things with less effort and resources, and we've also gotten better at building things that are more efficient, functional, and sustainable. We've also gotten better at building things that are more aesthetically pleasing, so we're less inclined to build massive, impressive structures that are mostly just impressive.   better at building things that serve the same purpose without being as big and impressive.

","We are amazed because building massive structures without sophisticated machines and tools seems amazing to us today. We haven't ""lost"" anything though. People kept right on building amazing structures right the way through history. The pyramids, the Acropolis, the Aqueducts, hundreds of amazing Cathedrals, etc. The simple answer is we sorta didn't. When people say we don't know how they built the pyramids, it's more about us not knowing their exact methods, not about how they were so advanced and we could never do it today. We do have plenty of plausible theories but we can't say we know exactly for all of them. The amazement is about what they managed to achieve with what they had, not about us not being capable of replicating it at all. Also keep in mind the amount of time and effort that was put into some of these megastructures. They took many decades to build and were huge efforts that often took the resources of powerful kingdoms/states/empires. I'd say it's better to compare the building of the pyramids to something like the Space Race and moon landing rather than to buildings today. Also note that it's not as if these megastructures somehow prove that ancient peoples had better building technology. They would've found it impossible to build the skyscrapers we can put up in a few short years. The Roman ancient roads were an amazing achievement at the time, but they would not have found it possible to build the US highway system. And just because stone tablets will last hundreds of more years than paper doesn't mean that they are somehow more advanced to develop. We could probably build the Pyramids today if we had the motive. It would probably be cheaper than the border wall. I often hear amazement specifically for the size of stones used in ancient structures. As far as I know, the ancients haven't been surpassed in that regard. We could surpass them if we wanted to, but we have modern materials that are easier to build with. So, we don't surpass the massive stones, and we remain awed by the real achievements of engineering that used them. Similarly, entering a structure made all of wood with no nails can impress us for achievements that we do not emulate today. The examples abound of architectural practices that awe is that are out of vogue: gargoyles, stained glass, spires, even large scale brickwork is not seen so much and impresses me when I see the beautiful rows of bricks, and the devil's bridges, and the mud skyscrapers of Yemen, and so on. I've heard ""how did they get so many people to build that?"" on more than one occasion for an ancient structure that would've taken hundreds or even thousands to assemble. Well, to not be to blunt...slavery or forced servitude or conscripted labor. Many of the marvels of ancient times--like the pyramids--were heavily built by ~~slave~~ conscripted labor. **some structures like the Colosseum used slave labor** With slavery now much less prominent, and considered by most modernized civilizations to be barbaric and cruel, we rely on the heavy work to be done with engineering and usually individuals on risk-pay (relatively high pay for unskilled labor based on very high risk of injury or death). Even very large tasks in the last couple centuries utilized a good amount of forced or slave labor until we developed machines to expedite the work. Like the Railroad system of the US. Don't know if that was what you were asking. Edit: pyramids were a bad example, as some pointed out they didn't use a lot of slaves, but conscripted labor. Added the Colosseum example, as everyone will know that, and slaves were definitely utilized. I'm also not saying there wasn't technique involved, but the actual workload used a good amount of forced human effort. Omg I've been Binge Playing Civ 6 and my shallow knowledge of history thinks I have the answer to this. We can still build these structures, the thing that amazes people is the way we would do it today didn't exist back then. I suspect that amazes people primarily because it's so disjointed from the current reality. 1. We didn't lose the way these were created. 2. We can and do make much more amazing things today. The typical office building is a more complex feat than a pyramid and something completely impossible for an ancient civilization to achieve. 3.

Why do German luxury automobile brands such as Audi/BMW/Mercedes recommend oil changes every 15K+ miles whereas American standard brands like Ford and Chevy still recommend oil changes every 3-5K miles?,"The answer is that the oil changes are not the same.

","Service contracts. BMW used to recommend oil changes every 5000 miles or so, but then the marketing department got involved and offered free oil changes for the first X years, and once the dealers had to pay the cost of the service the interval magically tripled so you needed fewer of them. The effect is that with the reduced servicing the car will still run fine for the duration of the warranty, but at the end of the warranty period it'll have more wear and tear and may need to be replaced sooner - another win for the marketing department. It's mostly due to advances in petroleum engineering. German cars use full synthetic oil, usually 5w-40 or 0w-40 depending on the region you live. The first number measures the oil at very cold temperatures(0F). The second number measures the oils' performance at engine operating temperature (210F). This is important for oil life. Full synthetic oils last much, much longer than natural oils, since they have been specifically engineered to do so. Additionally by having a high heat tolerance -40 oils don't degrade due to heat as fast as lower rated oils. You could put full synthetic 0w-30 in an american car and go 10,000 miles between changes no problem. But I wouldn't recommend putting -40 in a car that wants -30, it might be a little too thick that what the engine was designed for. Check your owners manual. Many cars today don't go by the 3,000 mile thing anymore. The dealer will, but they sell oil changes so they want you in as often as possible. Here in Europe I had Ford, Peugeot, Citroen and Fiat. They all suggested an oil change at 20.000 km (13.000 miles). Some models even 30.000 km. Don't know how reliable this info is but I notice specifically with BMW that for a V8, the oil quantity is anywhere from 8.5-10 quarts of oil. Add full synthetic to the blend and essentially you have a huge oil storage capacity, thereby making your oil last longer and help your engine stay lubricated. BMW 6 cylinder engines are about 6.9 quarts as well. Whereas other domestic manufacturers seem to have less oil quantities for the comparable engine sizes. That's just what I've noticed, don't know if there's any truth to it. My oil changes on my 2015 Mini (which has a BMW motor) are 8,000 miles and I do oil changes every 4K because I drive hard on it and have a turbo motor.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.53, 'recall': 22.95, 'fmeasure': 30.06}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.49, 'recall': 3.42, 'fmeasure': 4.48}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.55, 'recall': 11.36, 'fmeasure': 14.88}}"
"From an electrical engineering perspective, how does binary code actually work?","Binary code is the language of computers. It is used to represent numbers, letters, and other information. It is made up of two digits: 0 and 1. In binary code, each digit is either a 0 or a 1. This means that the only numbers that can be represented in binary code are 0 and 1. However, this is not a problem because computers are designed to work with these two numbers. Computers can only store and use the numbers 0 and 1. This is because they are the only numbers that are represented as two digits: 0 and 1. This means that computers can only use two digits: 0 and 1. This is the reason that binary code is called a ""language."" It is a way of communicating with a computer. It is also the reason that computers are called ""binary computers."" It is a computer that can only use two digits: 0 and 1.","On a physical level, it works via logic gates. The principle behind them is that they take one or two bits (which will be a wire with a current going through it or not) and output a single bit. Here are the main ones used for every possible mathematical operation: * **AND** -- Takes two bits and only output 1 if both input bits are 1 * **OR** -- Takes two bits and only outputs 1 if one or both input bits are 1 * **NOT** -- Takes one bit and flips it. Output 1 if the input is 0, outputs 0 if the input is 1 * **XOR** -- Takes two bits and outputs 1 if either bit is one, but will output 0 if *both* bits are one. This gate isn't actually necessary, you can get the same result by combining the above gates. But that's the key, we can combine gates to get more complex operations. With these operations you can perform any mathematical operation on any number, which is the only thing computers ever do. How do the gates work? Well let's imagine that we put a resistor into a circuit. It won't allow a current to continue unless the input is twice the current of a single wire, so both wires feeding into it need to be active. This is an AND gate. On the other hand, if we just connected the two wires together with diodes to make sure the current goes to where we want it to, that's an OR gate. If we have a power source constantly powering a wire, but a breaker switch is activated when an input wire is powered, that's a NOT gate. The actual gates don't work like this on a CPU level, with diodes and breaker switches and such, but the electronic concepts are the same. It is, as you said, a series of switches. In the right combinations those switches form some basic logic circuits. The 3 basic ones are AND - this takes two inputs and if they are both 1 it outputs a 1, otherwise a zero (no voltage). Next is an OR gate. Again this takes 2 inputs but if either of them is 1 (high) it outputs a 1. If both are low its output is also low. Finally we have a NOT gate. This inverts the input. A 1 becomes 0 and 0 becomes 1. Now these can be grouped together into logic circuits that perform computationally interesting operations. String lots of logic blocks together and you have a processor. Now again all the processor does is take +ve and -ve signals on the input pins, passes these through the processor and the result (+ve and -ve) is presented on the ouput pins. From there, transistor amplifiers can take these signals and amplify them into things we can see or hear.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 62.18, 'recall': 20.29, 'fmeasure': 30.6}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.74, 'recall': 2.52, 'fmeasure': 3.8}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.21, 'recall': 9.21, 'fmeasure': 13.88}}"
How exactly do planes compensate for the curvature of the earth when they are flying?,"...
It's not just a case of ""oh, I can just fly around the curve of the earth"" because it's not a simple curve. What do you mean by ""curvature of the earth""? The earth is not a perfect sphere, it is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. The curvature of the earth is not uniform, it varies depending on the location and the direction you are looking. In general, the curvature of the earth is greatest at the equator and decreases as you move towards the poles. The curvature of the earth is measured in radians, which is the angle between the line of sight and a point on the earth. In the northern hemisphere, the curvature is greater than 1 radian at the equator and less than 1 radian at the poles. In the southern hemisphere, the curvature is less than 1 radian at the equator and greater than 1 radian at the poles. The curvature of the earth affects the flight of planes in several ways. One of the most important effects is the difference in air pressure between the equator and the poles. The air pressure is greater at the equator than at the poles, which means that the air is denser at the equator than at the poles.  ","Planes **DO NOT NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VERTICAL CURVATURE OF THE EARTH WHEN MAINTAINING ALTITUDE**. Everyone telling you they constantly adjust down a little bit is wrong. The Earth is curved, as is its atmosphere. An aircraft determines its altitude based on atmospheric pressure. Therefore, we do not define ""level flight"" as being tangential to the Earth's surface, but rather as being an altitude relating to a specific atmospheric pressure. Therefore, if the plane is trimmed for level flight it will ALWAYS remain at the same altitude above the Earth. Picture a plane flying [perfectly level above a point on a curved globe]( URL_0 ). In your question, you're assuming the plane flights horizontally (the first image in that link). However, this would only be the case if there were no atmosphere. A more accurate visualization is to rotate the Earth beneath the aircraft (second image). You see how the surface of the Earth directly below the aircraft is at the same location? Because the atmosphere moves with the Earth, THAT is level flight. Aircraft don't move quickly enough for the curvature to be significant over the minor corrections just to maintain level flight. If the aircraft is kept level it is following the curvature already. They control their flight by aerodynamics, and the atmosphere of course curves with the Earth. So when a plane is 'trimmed' for straight and level flight it will automatically follow the curvature of the Earth. Also a plane isn't a dumb object, it's being actively controlled by a pilot or an autopilot, and they will use either their eyes or instruments to determine the orientation and height of the plane compared to the ground and make control inputs to maintain that straight level flight. EDIT PS: If a plane went fast enough that the Earth's curvature would be significant, it would simply fly as though it weighed less than its true weight. The same way absolutely everything else does. There's two ways you need to compensate. One is flight path and the other is altitude. Flight path is easy. Instead of using flat maps, you use great circle routes. North of the equator, the fastest way to reach a target due east or west of you isn't to go due east or west but to take a more northeast path. This depends on distance, something diametrically opposite would have a great circle route through the north pole. South of the equator it's the other way. As for maintaining altitude, the plane has to deal with two factors: gravity and curvature of the earth. The former is causing the plane to veer downwards and the latter is causing it to veer upwards. Well, as it turns out, gravity is a LOT more of a factor than the curvature of the earth! So, like every other object travelling over the earth, it doesn't have to compensate AT ALL for the curvature, because gravity has already done that. It just has to compensate for what's left of gravity. And sometimes gravity's effect and the curvature' effect are equal. We call that an orbit.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 59.38, 'recall': 25.14, 'fmeasure': 35.33}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.39, 'recall': 7.77, 'fmeasure': 10.92}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.14, 'recall': 13.61, 'fmeasure': 19.12}}"
How do some mechanics know what's wrong with a vehicle just by sound?," Makes me wonder how mechanics can tell what's wrong with a car just by the sound it makes. It's like they have a special sense for it. I've seen them check out a car, hear the sound, and then tell the owner exactly what's wrong with it. How do they do it? The answer is actually very interesting. They use a technique called the ""car sound diagnosis."" It's a process that involves listening to the engine, transmission, exhaust, and other parts of the car to determine what's wrong. The process is actually very complex and involves a lot of science. Here are some of the things they listen for: 1. Engine noise - They listen to the engine noise to determine if the engine is working properly. If the engine is making a knocking or tapping sound, it means that the engine is experiencing problems with the valves, pistons, or crankshaft. 2. Transmission noise - They listen to the transmission noise to determine if the transmission is working properly. If the transmission is making a grinding or clunking sound, it means that the transmission is experiencing problems with the gears, bearings, or other parts. 3. Exhaust noise - They listen to the exhaust noise to determine if the exhaust system is working properly.  ",Its usually sound and when that sound happens or what your doing when that sound happens. You can narrow it down to what parts are used for that action and the sound they make when they are breaking. Like a bad wheel bearing on tbe left side will make a rubbing grinding noise when you turn right because more weight is put on the left side. High pitch whine when you accelerate. Is usually a pully if it gets louder when turning wheels its a power steering pump.

How do 3-D printers actually work? Why can't we just 3D print everything?,"Ъ. So you want to know how 3D printing works? Well, I have to start with a warning: I'm going to explain this in a very simplified way, and I'm going to use a lot of metaphors. I'm sorry, but I don't know of any other way to explain it. But I hope you'll get the gist of it. So, the first thing you need to understand is that 3D printing is a process of adding material to a surface, one layer at a time. The way we do this is by using a machine called a 3D printer. The printer has a big, long tube that sticks out of it. That's called the extruder. The extruder is where the magic happens. The extruder has a little nozzle on the end of it, and it shoots out a stream of hot, melted plastic. It's like a hot glue gun, but it's much more precise. The extruder shoots the plastic out in a line, and that line is called a ""layer"". When the printer is done shooting the plastic, it's done with the layer. Then it goes back to the beginning and starts again. So, what happens to the plastic when it's shot out of the extruder? Well, it's a bit like when you make a snowman.  ","The technique used by 3d printers is called ""additive manufacturing"" which means they put down one thin layer after another, eventually making a solid item. We can't use it on everything because it ends up being fairly weak. Think of a baseball bat made of solid wood versus one from particle board. The latter would wear away and snap in half long before the former would show any signs of problems. And, combine that with the fact that 3d printers are limited to materials which can be turned from somewhat liquid to solid fairly easily. You can't do it with something like steel, at least with currently available machines. Once you have the ability to assemble the material on a molecular level, then you'll be talking when it comes to 3d printing becoming dominant. The most common variety of 3d printers works by melting down plastic to create 2D layers (of a small thickness) stacked on top of each other (a program slices a 3d model into those quasi-2d slices). There are a few disadvantages with 3d printing that other manufacturing techniques solve. The first is cost and time. 3D printing is horribly slow, and the material isn't cheap due to processing. For bulk production, an alternative example is injection molding, which has a startup cost, but can produce a lot of an object many times quicker than a printer. The second is accuracy. 3D printers can not produce perfectly smooth surfaces (especially if non-linear) and have a finite resolution. There are many more precise techniques of creating a feature on an object. Another is materials. Commercial 3D printers are only able to work with a handful of materials, and what would be the best choice for an object may not be us bale in a printer. The properties of a product of 3d printing may be undesirable (such as strength) compared to other production methods.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 45.58, 'recall': 31.99, 'fmeasure': 37.59}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.56, 'recall': 5.3, 'fmeasure': 6.23}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.14, 'recall': 12.73, 'fmeasure': 14.96}}"

Why are power line wires exposed and not covered with a coating?,"Because they're meant to be used by humans. A lot of power lines are used to distribute electricity to homes and businesses.

Why can we not harness lighting as an energy source?,"It's actually really hard to harness lightning, and the energy it provides is very short lived. It's not like a solar panel, where you can put it up and it will just keep generating power. Lightning is like a very powerful battery, and once it's used up, it's gone. Also, it's very rare, and it's very difficult to predict where it will strike. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. It's also very dangerous, and you need to be very careful when trying to harness it. Lightning is also very short lived, and it's very difficult to capture. It's like a lightning bolt, it's very hard to catch and store.","Lightning is unpredictable and at the same time very powerful. The voltage is extremely high and also the current. This results in the components and power stations need to be really robust and will be much more expensive. Anorther thing with electricity is that it's a fresh produce, and only produced for immidiate consumption. No power plant is producing more power than what is being consumed, that's because there's no effective way of storing energy. So this means that the lightning would have to strike exactlt at the moment people need it. And since it only last for a fraction of a second it can be a problem if you want to watch tv for 2 hours. 1. Unpredictable. 2. If you solve the issue with unpredictability (building a lightning rod, for example and placing it somewhere stormy), gathering that energy in batteries would be difficult, as the energy source discharges the energy episodically and in very short periods of time (think what happens to your phone charger when there is spike in electricity). 3.

Why do elevators decide to wait at the floors they do?," Elevators are programmed to go to a certain floor. Once that floor is reached, it is programmed to stop and wait for a signal from the occupants. The occupants will typically press a button to indicate they are ready to leave the elevator. Once the occupants have left the elevator, it will then be programmed to go to the next floor. This process is repeated until the elevator reaches the final destination. There are a couple of reasons why an elevator will wait at a floor. The first is that the elevator may be programmed to wait at a floor if there is a lot of traffic at that floor. This is often the case in large buildings where many people will use the elevator at the same time. The second reason is that the elevator may be programmed to wait at a floor if there is a problem with the elevator. This could be a mechanical problem or a problem with the elevator's programming. In this case, the elevator will not move until the problem is resolved. This is why it is important to have a maintenance program in place for elevators. This program will ensure that the elevator is regularly serviced and that any problems are identified and repaired before they cause any issues. Elevators have sensors that detect when the doors are closed and when the elevator is at the desired floor.  ","The simplest solution is to have elevators wait whereever they were called last. Some controllers are smart enough that they can be configured to move empty elevators around to prevent having multiple elevators waiting on one floor, and to minimize the wait time on high-demand origin floors.

Object Oriented Programming Languages,"are different from other programming languages because they are designed to model real-world objects and systems. in other words, the objects in the programming language are similar to the objects in the real world. the real world is full of objects and systems. an object is a thing that has a set of properties and behaviors. a system is a set of objects that work together to accomplish something. for example, a car is an object. a car has properties like color, make, model, etc. a car has behaviors like moving, stopping, etc. a car is a system because it has a set of objects that work together to move and stop. the same is true of a human body. a human body is a system of objects that work together to do things like breathing, eating, walking, etc. Object Oriented Programming Languages are designed to model these systems. in other words, they are designed to model the real world. the real world is full of objects and systems. a computer program is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to do things. a computer program is a system of instructions that work together to accomplish something. Object Oriented Programming Languages are designed to model these systems. they are designed to model the real world. they are designed to be used to build real world systems. Object Oriented Programming Languages are designed to be used to build real world systems.  ","I actually had to explain this to my 5 year old. A procedural program is like a recipe. If you want to make a cake you take the recipe and do each step. Sometimes the steps refer to other recipes (like the icing); we call those ""methods"". And there are amounts of things you have (like cups of flour); we call those variables. Now let's say you were baking a 8 course meal. You'd have a ton of recipes (methods) and amounts of stuff (variables) to keep track of. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of organizing the methods and variables to keep everything together. An object is a thing (a noun) and you attach variables (usually called properties) and methods (verbs). The object keeps all of that stuff together and makes sure that you don't mix up your cake recipe with another one. But one important takeaway is that these are not mutually exclusive. Most (but not all) OOP languages are procedural, and a lot (but not all) procedural languages offer OOP. Note that in the following examples, I'm using pretty standard OOP terminology, but things may vary by language. The basic idea of OOP is that you describe your program as a set of objects, each of which have their own data and behavior. For example, a game might have a Player object containing the data ""health"", ""speed"", and ""strength"", and containing the behaviors ""Move with keyboard input"", ""lose health (and possibly die)"", and ""drink health potion"". Now let's say we want to add AI players, or networked players. Suddenly we need our Player class to be more flexible! The ""Move with keyboard input"" behavior is no longer acceptable. One simple way to solve this is to make Player into something called a ""base"" class: replace ""Move with keyboard input"" with the more generic ""Move with some kind of input"", then create ""child classes"" called HumanPlayer, NetworkedPlayer, and AIPlayer that all handle their ""Move with some kind of input"" in different ways. This is known as ""inheritance"": defining child classes that act like a special version of the base, or ""parent"", class. Alongside inheritance is ""polymorphism"" and ""encapsulation"". Your game could store a list of ""Player""s, each of which is one of the child Player types, and call each of their ""Move with some kind of input"" without caring which type each Player actually is! If you want a new networked player, just add a new NetworkedPlayer to the list -- the game doesn't care what kind of Player he is; it just runs his behaviors like it would with any other Player. In other words, the responsibility of handling all that player's networking code is ""encapsulated"" in the NetworkedPlayer class, so nobody else has to worry, care, or even *know* about it. This is the main advantage of OOP: a powerful way of grouping code so that other groups of code only have to care about the outward interface it exposes, not everything that might be going on underneath. Edit: typos For context, one of the reasons why explaining these concepts is difficult is that the last few generations of programmers did their entire computer science education within procedural and object-oriented paradigms. Both ideas came out of the [software crisis]( URL_0 ) in the 1960s where the complexity of software development projects was increasing too fast for engineers to keep up. Recent CS students and professionals (myself included) never worked in a world where these things were not the main way people did things. In a procedural programming language, a program consists of instructions describing actions the computer is to take. Pretty much every modern and popular programming language is procedural in some way, and your first CS teachers may have actually defined computer programs as ""instructions for the computer to follow."" One alternative to procedural programming is functional programming where a program isn't so much a list of actions but a list of expressions that represent the type of data the program is supposed to produce. Lisp and SQL are examples of this model of programming. Object-oriented programming is primarily a method of code organization. Generally, you learn about data (variables) and procedures (functions) as separate things. OOP languages package related data and procedures together. The primary advantage of this is that how a piece of a software system *works* is separated/isolated from how it's *used* by the rest of the software system. This idea is called ""encapsulation"" and allows software teams to work separately on parts of a large project and then easily join them together. These are not really different things. Almost all languages are procedural. Procedural refers to procedures. You can think of your code as being one procedure, with maybe sub-procedures in it. Procedure being one set of instructions that your computer follows. Typical example is a recipe, that's a procedure of sorts. Your CPU, at its core, works like this, so most languages derive procedural nature of theirs from CPU. However, once you start building these complex procedures(think of 1,000 page long recipes with cross-references), you'll notice that it's actually darn difficult to safely change any section of the recipe and still have any sort of prediction about what is gonna happen next. If you change one sub-procedure(sub-recipe that may or may not be referenced from elsewhere), you're gonna have to go through all the 1,000 pages with care to make sure none of those pages suddenly stop making sense as a result of your one change. OOP is a proposed solution to this. It packs sub-procedures with the data they handle into Objects. This means when you make changes into some sub-procedure, you only have to check the pages dealing with this object. You can, by purposefully programming so that you refrain from referencing to data outside selected pages, do Object-Oriented Programming even with programming languages that are purely procedural with no Object-Oriented Programming support. OOP languages exist to help programming this way, packing data and procedures that handle that data together. But the big key thing here is that you will have limited access to all Data, which is managed by objects, so that if data is corrupt, that must be because of the limited number of functions that are allowed to handle that data.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 64.61, 'recall': 14.6, 'fmeasure': 23.82}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.12, 'recall': 3.63, 'fmeasure': 5.93}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.16, 'recall': 7.72, 'fmeasure': 12.59}}"
How does the PID controller works?," PID stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative. It is a control algorithm used to control temperature, pressure, flow, and other processes. The algorithm uses three control terms to adjust the output of the process based on the error between the desired and actual values. The three terms are proportional, integral, and derivative. Proportional term: This term adjusts the output based on the current error value. The proportional term is calculated by dividing the error by the set point. The output is then adjusted by multiplying the proportional term by the set point. Integral term: This term adjusts the output based on the integral of the error over time. The integral term is calculated by multiplying the integral of the error by a gain factor. The integral term is used to adjust the output for processes that exhibit steady-state error. Derivative term: This term adjusts the output based on the derivative of the error over time. The derivative term is calculated by multiplying the derivative of the error by a gain factor. The derivative term is used to adjust the output for processes that exhibit rapid changes. The PID algorithm calculates the output for each of the three control terms and combines them into a single output value. The output value is then used to control the process. The PID algorithm can be implemented in a variety of ways. Here are some common ways to implement the PID algorithm: 1.  ","Consider a simple ""proportional"" controller. This device takes an input, determines the error between input and set point, and then generates an output which is proportional to the error. Let's take a thermostat. An oven has a thermostat with a set point of 250 C. The thermostat controls a heater. If the oven temperature is 220 C, then the error is 30 C. The controller multiplies the error by a constant (say 1%) and outputs a signal of 30% to the heater. If the oven temperature falls to 200 C, then the heater power is increased to 50%. If it rises to 250 C or above, the heater is switched off. This is fine, but what happens if something happens and the oven temperature suddenly changes - maybe the door is opened causing a rapid drop in temperature. The classic proportional controller waits until temperature drops before increasing heater power. Wouldn't it be useful if the controller could recognise a door opening, and give the heater a boost? This is where ""derivative"" control comes in - the rate of change of error is measured, and used to adjust the output. So, let's say the oven is at 240 C and the heater is at 10%. The door is opened, and the oven temperature starts decreasing at 1 C/s. The controller multiplies this by a constant (say 10% s/C), and adds this to the ouptut. In this case, the derivative term is 10%, which is added to the proportional term (10%) to give a total output of 20%. So what does ""integral"" control do? One of the problems with proportional control is that if you have an external drag on the system (e.g. heat loss from oven walls), then in order for this to be compensated (e.g. by heater power) you need an error input to the controller (because output = error * k, and therefore error = output / k) So, if your oven has 100 W of heat loss, and a 1 kW heater - then you need 10% heater power just to maintain power, and in the example above, this means you need a 10 C error. This means your oven will stabilize at 240 C, even if your set point is 250 C. Integral control integrates the error over time and adds this into the control. So, in the example above, after 1 minute with a 10 C error, the accumulated error integral is 10 C*minutes. In response to this, the controller multiplies this by a constant (e.g. 0.1% /C/minute), which in this case comes to 1% (for a total power of 11%), and adds it to the power. The oven temperature starts increasing and settles at 241 C. After another minute, the accumulated error integral is around 19 C*minutes, and the controller has increased power to 1.9% for integral control and 9% for proportional control - for a total of 10.9%. After several minutes the system settles down at exactly 250 C, the proportional control is at 0%, and the integral control is exactly balancing the heat loss. So, the proportional control, provides the basic control by negative feedback. Derivative control detects developing rapid anomalies and allows for faster correction than would be possible by proportional control. Integral control, detects long term anomalies, and ensures that the set point isn't affected by them.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.58, 'recall': 24.82, 'fmeasure': 34.87}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.18, 'recall': 5.15, 'fmeasure': 7.24}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.87, 'recall': 12.23, 'fmeasure': 17.19}}"

How does genetic engineering affect food?,"It affects food in the same way that all other genetic engineering does. It introduces new genes to the organism, and changes its genetic code. This can result in new traits, and can potentially make the organism more resistant to disease, pests, or environmental conditions. It can also potentially make the organism more toxic, or more likely to cause allergies. But this is true of any genetic engineering. The difference between genetic engineering and traditional breeding is that traditional breeding is a very slow process that requires many generations, while genetic engineering can be done in a matter of years. It also allows for much more precise changes to the genetic code, which can result in more predictable results.","Genetic engineering is a wide field in agriculture. It is a combination of selective breeding and genetic alteration to produce a desired result. For example, Monsanto is a major producer of GMO seeds. They sell their seeds to farmers at typically 10x the cost of a regular seed. Their seed, however, has been selectively bred and the DNA modified to contain genetics that are desirable to a farmer. The seeds are typically modified through CRISPR (google it if unsure what that is). Monsanto's best selling and most effective GMO seed to date has been soybeans. Their soybean seed has been modified so that it is unaffected by a chemical called glyphosate (also known to most people as Round Up). They market the seeds as ""Round Up Ready"". They have other GMO seeds as well, some not very effective (for example the GMO cotton seeds don't really work and aren't widely used). Basically a farmer plants Round Up Ready soybeans and they can broadcast spray the field with glyphosate periodically which kills all plants in the field (weeds) but does not kill the soybeans. End result: the farmers yield is significantly increased. Weeds are a major problem for large scale farmers. If you don't use GMO seeds then you have to use some other weed control method and most other methods are either labor intensive, cost prohibitive, or not that effective or even speculative. There is a lot of research (literally billions of dollars) going into new methods to control weeds. Over time, weeds develop resistance to herbicides (much like antibiotics and bacteria). There's other issues around GMO seeds, not health issues like you'll get cancer from GMO seeds, but rather issues of cost and genetic diversity among plants. You have to remember GMO seeds aren't manufactured in a lab. Rather they are developed through modification then selectively bred from plants (the seeds come from a fully grown plant). On a side note, the legislation that would require GMO labels on food products would literally result in 99% of food being labeled with a GMO label.

How do cities with high annual rainfall deal with construction?," Drywall, wood, and other building materials are made from organic matter, and are susceptible to rotting when exposed to moisture. To prevent this from happening, cities with high annual rainfall often use specialized building materials that are resistant to moisture, such as concrete, brick, and stone. These materials are also often used in construction in cities with low annual rainfall, but are particularly useful in areas with high rainfall. When it comes to wood, the most common way to prevent rotting is to use pressure-treated wood, which is treated with chemicals that prevent the growth of mold and fungus. However, this is not always an option, as pressure-treated wood can be expensive. In some cases, cities will use a type of wood that is naturally resistant to moisture, such as cedar. In addition to using specialized materials, cities with high annual rainfall often use specialized construction techniques to prevent water damage. For example, buildings in these cities are often built with a foundation that is sunk deep into the ground, to prevent water from accumulating around the foundation. In addition, buildings are often designed with a sloped roof, which allows water to run off the roof and prevent it from accumulating on the building.  ","Concrete doesn't 'dry', it 'cures'.

The sheet music is then scanned again, and the notes are read in. The computer then reads the notes, and assigns them to the correct grid locations. The computer then calculates the timing of each note, and the correct volume. The notes are then played back in the order they were written. The notes are played back in a loop, so that the computer can read the next set of notes, and play them back.

What's the black stuff that comes out of sprinklers when hey break?," Saw this on a local news channel and they said it was a type of oil. They also said that it was a common problem with older sprinklers. It is actually a type of oil called Poly alpha olefin. It is used to lubricate the moving parts of the sprinkler, and is designed to last a long time. It is not a problem with older sprinklers, but it is a problem with newer sprinklers that have more moving parts. It is a problem because it is not biodegradable, so it can not be washed away by water. It will just sit on the ground, and eventually it will break down into tiny particles that can be ingested by animals and plants, and it will cause them harm. It is a problem because it is not easily removed from the ground. It is not a problem with the water itself, but it is a problem with the sprinklers. The water is not contaminated with the oil, but it is contaminated with the particles that are left behind by the oil. It is a problem because it is not good for the environment. It is a problem because it is not good for the animals and plants that live in the area where it is being used.

Why has the technique for manufacturing a samurai sword never been replicated by modern engineering?,"  basic principles of the forging process have been replicated, but the unique qualities of the steel and the way it is folded and quenched have never been replicated.  re are also some differences in the way the sword is sharpened and polished, but that's not really a major factor in the uniqueness of the sword.   way the steel is folded and quenched is what makes the sword so strong and flexible.   process of folding the steel is called ""tamahagane"".   steel is heated to a high temperature and then folded over itself. This process creates a lot of tiny cracks in the steel, which are then filled with carbon. This process is repeated many times until the steel is as strong as it can be.   steel is then heated again and quenched in water, which causes it to harden.   process of quenching is what makes the steel so hard and strong.   process of sharpening the sword is also unique.   sword is sharpened on a stone called a ""yakota"". This is a very hard stone that is used to sharpen the sword.   process of sharpening the sword is called ""kizu"". This process involves sharpening the sword over and over again until it is very sharp.   process of polishing the sword is also unique.  ","Modern engineering does not replicate the technique for making samurai swords because the technique for making samurai swords, by definition, requires it to be done by hand. Modern engineering also does not seek to create a samurai sword because samurai swords were kind of crap. They were impressive for the material quality the ancient Japanese had to work with, but it's trivial to make a much better sword nowadays. Even back in old times, Europeans were cranking out much better swords because they had decent iron to make them from. Samurai swords being crap is also why modern things aren't influenced by them. The how it's made section would be pointlessly long, and you would end up with an inferior cutting tool compared to what can be produced from start to finish in a matter of days now. And about Japan holding off western powers: They really didn't. Japan wasn't conquered but their military power had little to do with it. Their weapons were not peerless, but it would have been impractical to go over there and conquer them when they let you trade anyway. The United States rather trivially forced Japan to open its gates to trade and Japan was soon after westernized by western powers. Then the United States went into Japan again and rewrote their constitution after Japan did something dumb. Any western power could have conquered Japan after a moderate fight way back in the colonial era had they wanted to do so. Edit: And you wanna know why Japan did that stupid thing that got the US mad at them?

"What effect does the curvature of the Earth have on really large buildings, roads and other infrastructure?"," Sounds like a very interesting question! I'll try to help. The curvature of the Earth is not really a big deal. The Earth is a pretty big ball, and it's pretty flat, and you can build roads and buildings and other infrastructure on it without much of a problem. The only real difference is that the horizon is curved, and that can make things look a little weird if you're not used to it. But it's not a big deal. As for really big buildings, there's a few things that can happen. First, the curvature of the Earth means that the horizon is curved. If you're building a really tall building, you can't see the horizon. You can't see the horizon because the Earth is curved.   can't see the horizon because the Earth is curved.   can't see the horizon because the Earth is curved.   can't see the horizon because the Earth is curved.   can't see the horizon because the Earth is curved.   can't see the horizon because the Earth is curved.   can't see the horizon because the Earth is curved.  ","First of all, yes, of course. They are building it on a spheroid. But second of all, we know or can calculate the average curvature of the earth, so could curve it properly if need be. However, practically, I don't think it matters. The only common structure big enough to even worry about the curve (that I can think of) is transportation like highways or railroads, or the occasional bridge. They just build them on the ground*, which has been moved around as needed with heavy machinery to be within tolerances. You can make sure it's all true with good ol' Euclidean (flat) geometry. I know there's a lot more that goes into roads and railroads than literally ""put them on the ground"" but I'm not a civil engineer and that's not really within the scope of the question. With buildings, practically never. They don't cover enough land area that curvature needs to be taken into account, and their sites will be graded flat prior to construction which will eliminate any residual effect of curvature. Tunnels basically ignore it, short ones are just built straight and longer ones (such as the Channel Tunnel) curve to go through the best rock formations. It only really comes into play with really big bridges. The Verrazano-Narrows, for example, has 693 foot tall towers that are 4,260 feet apart, and in order to take the Earth's curvature into account, the tops of the towers are 1.625 inches farther apart than their bases. Earth's curvature changes its height, on average, 11cm per km. This is far, far less than natural local variations in terrain. Therefore it has no effect on people making buildings. Generally, they almost always don't. The variations are incredibly small. However, one (amusing) exception are some proposed towers in the UK: URL_0 They want to use them for high frequency trading with Europe. Turns out over that distance, the curvature does matter, because they want unobstructed line of sight (HFT is sensitive to even millisecond delays). So they need to build the tower a bit higher than normally.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.33, 'recall': 23.96, 'fmeasure': 31.1}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.33, 'recall': 5.03, 'fmeasure': 6.53}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.65, 'recall': 11.7, 'fmeasure': 15.19}}"
"Why is SpaceX so interested in vertical landings? With all the knowledge we have about Mars and its terrain, wouldn't it be easier to plan a ""horizontal"" entry to the planet, similar to how astronauts land on Earth?","The key here is that the Mars atmosphere is very thin, so you don't have to slow down nearly as much as you do on Earth. That means that you can actually land with a lot of speed, and you have to be able to stop quickly. If you land on a flat surface, that's going to be a lot harder to do. If you land on a hillside, you're going to slide down the hill and it's going to be hard to stop. If you land on a rocky area, you're going to bounce. So, you want to land on a flat area. That's where the vertical landing comes in. It's a lot easier to land on a flat area if you land vertically. That means you can land on a flat area that's not necessarily flat. It's also a lot safer. If you land on a flat area, you can land on a rock or a bump that's hidden under the surface, and that could cause you to crash. If you land vertically, you can land on a rock or a bump that's hidden under the surface, and you'll just bounce off. That's why they want to land vertically. It's also worth noting that the vertical landing is not the only thing that makes this spacecraft special.  ","The issue is landing so you can reuse the rocket. The cheapest way to do that is vertically. You just can't deaccelerate quickly enough horizontally. Think of the old NASA shuttle. It ditched the booster immediately after launch so it didn't have so much mass to deal with and slow down on reentry. The goal of spaceX is to keep that booster. I don't think the whole landing trajectory is vertical, just the last part of it so they have a reusable rocket. Landing rockets is about the reusability and therefore reduced cost of rocket launch in the first place. Taking off from a horizontal landing is harder then a vertical landing. By landing vertically its technically possible to land on mars establish a colony and take off again in the future. The space shuttle lands at like 220mph... lol it requires literally a couple miles of flat runway. No such thing exists on Mars. And mars is capable of very high winds and an unforgiving rocky surface. If you're talking about landing like a plane, it would be very hard to land like that on Mars. Why? Because of the extremely thin atmosphere that wouldn't generate sufficient lift at all. It would also be hard to find stable ground until a proper runway would be built. It is much easier to just land vertically and take off vertically.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 39.06, 'recall': 38.89, 'fmeasure': 38.97}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.76, 'recall': 7.73, 'fmeasure': 7.74}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.45, 'recall': 18.38, 'fmeasure': 18.42}}"
How did people on the Apollo missions knew the specifics of the moon?,"  moon is about 239,000 miles away from the Earth. This means that the moon is moving in the sky at about 1.5 inches per second. To make things more complicated, the moon is also rotating on its own axis at the same time. This means that the moon is also moving in its own orbit around the Earth.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the sun.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Milky Way.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Andromeda Galaxy.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Perseus Galaxy.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Pisces-Cetus Supercluster.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Laniakea Supercluster.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Milky Way.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Andromeda Galaxy.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Perseus Galaxy.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Pisces-Cetus Supercluster.   moon is also moving in its orbit around the Laniakea Supercluster.  ","By knowing the mass and size of the moon, we can what sort of gravity to expect, whether or not there is enough gravity for an atmosphere (there isn't), and without an atmosphere we can determine the temperature of the moon by observing its spectrum from Earth. And we can determine the mass and size of the moon by observing how objects in space move around the moon, and how the moon moves around the Earth. Think of it this way - if you are in the desert and see a small city in the distance - you might not know if it's small and close, or large and far away. So you move closer to it and make another measurement, and now you can determine whether it's small or far away. A lot of it can be calculated or observed. Just by knowing how big and heavy the Moon is it's easy to work out how much fuel and what kind of engine it takes to land. Observations by Earth-based telescopes and space probes gave us a good idea what the surface terrain was like. And there had been robotic landers such as Surveyor 3 sent before humans got anywhere near the Moon. (Apollo 12 landed right by Surveyor 3, near enough for the astronauts to walk over and check out the space probe.) That said there were still some doubts.

"When accelerating a car, the sound made by the engine is a typical one (constant working of pistons) . But why does the car make more of a mechanical toy like sound while reversing?","When you accelerate the car, the engine is moving in the same direction as the wheels. When you reverse, the engine is moving in the opposite direction as the wheels. This creates a difference in speed between the engine and the wheels, which creates a difference in frequency of the sound.","The reverse gear in the gearbox is cut as a straight or spur gear instead of a helical gear. This is cheaper than helical cut. And it's noisier. The basic principal of a car is to move rotational energy from an engine to the wheels. To control this we can control the speed of the engine of the ratio of how fast the wheels turn to the engine speed using a gearbox. This is also used to reverse the rotation of the wheels in relation to the engine output. If you imagine a two wheels pushed together, when one spins it will have friction against the other one causing the second wheel to turn. If one wheel is bigger it will turn slower than the other. Obviously if this is not kept tight together to maintain friction the second wheel won't turn. The other issue is that one wheel can turn past the other. To stop this from happening we force the wheels to mesh, creating gears by cutting identical patterns across each face which interlock. This is more robust than the wheel system as there can be no slip, which is why we use gears in a gear box. The easiest gears to make are straight gears, which means the cuts of material are taken across the face of the wheel, from one side to the other. This makes the teeth interlock squarely when presented to each other, and only at one small point with 1 tooth of overlap. The contact between teeth will rub, eventually making the gear teeth smaller than the opposite detent. This means when the face wears, there will be a very small gap and therefore impact as the next tooth meshes against the other gear. This creates a whirring noise, like reverse gear and some older first gears. The gears are straight cut to reduce cost as they are easy to make. Other gears do not make this noise as they are cut on a diagonal, creating longer gear teeth with multiple teeth meshing at the same time/position on the gear. This allows for less wear to occur on the gears, which lets the gears mesh quietly. The helical cuts also make the gears more durable as the multiple teeth prevent wear and promote good meshing of gears. This is why the second gear and above in most cars are helical: You spend most time in them going forwards, so they need to last longer and wear less. The noise reduction is another benefit added in. This is why older cars are noisier to drive, as the gear faces are more worn in the straight cut gears allowing for more play and hence more noise. Tl;dr: reverse is a cheaper noisier gear because you don't spend enough time in it to warrant the manufacturer doing the work to improve the gear When helical gears mesh, there are multiple teeth in contact regardless of the angular position. Straight gears only have continuous contact in theory, but when worn even only a little it becomes an intermittent contact which is more audible. Straight gears can transmit higher torque though.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 80.39, 'recall': 7.77, 'fmeasure': 14.16}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 32.0, 'recall': 3.04, 'fmeasure': 5.55}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 50.98, 'recall': 4.92, 'fmeasure': 8.98}}"
Why are cruise missiles used if ballistic missiles can reach targets faster?," In general, the missile is launched in a ballistic trajectory, but the missile is guided to the target. The guidance system, the propulsion system, and the control surfaces are all designed to take the missile on a curved path, so it can change direction and speed in flight. In contrast, a cruise missile is designed to fly along a more or less straight path. The missile flies at a low altitude and a low speed, and it can be steered by adjusting its thrust. The guidance system and control surfaces are designed to take the missile on a curved path, so it can change direction and speed in flight. In contrast, a ballistic missile is designed to fly in a straight path. It is launched at a high altitude and a high speed, and it can't change its course. A ballistic missile can be steered in flight, but it is not designed to be steered in flight. Ballistic missiles are designed to reach their targets with the minimum of fuel, and they can be steered in flight only with the minimum of fuel. If the ballistic missile is steered in flight, it will use more fuel, and the missile will not reach its target with the minimum of fuel. In contrast, a cruise missile is designed to reach its target with the maximum of fuel.  ","Why do pistols exist if you can hit a target with a 50 caliber sniper rifle at 1000 yards? It's cheaper, smaller, lighter, easier to deploy, and easier to get up close. Because nobody wants to anyone to think they're launching a nuclear first strike. There is no way to tell what sort of warhead a Ballistic missile carries. Launch one of these and you set off all kinds of armageddon. The Minuteman (the USA's current ICBM of choice) cost $7M each in 1970 - that's about $43M in today's dollars. A Tomahawk costs around $1.5M today. That completely ignores the massive infrastructure associated with maintaining ICBMs. ...and a cruise missile isn't going to scare the Russians into thinking you're starting a nuclear war. Same reason people still drive fords when Ferrari's can get places faster. Sometimes you have to weigh the cost versus how fast you're wanting to get someplace. Cruise missiles can track a target, with the exception of some new Chinese anti-ship ballistic missiles ballistic missiles are limited to fixed targets and even then have limited accuracy. Also they are generally easy to spot on radar and easier to shoot down as they are easy to spot and follow a predictable path--although they can be significantly faster than a cruise missile. Part of it is in the name. Ballistic trajectory means that if you can track where it is, you can tell where it's going to land. It follows an arc based on gravity with some corrections. Contrast that to predicting where an airplane that's cruising around is going to land. A ballistic missile goes very fast, is very large and is incredibly expensive. A cruise missile is essentially a plane drone, pretty cheap. You can put a little warhead on it and target one building or a window or now with facial recognition, a person. Also there is very little chance any of the other nuclear powers mistake a cruise missile strike as an ICBM launch so there is that.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 45.13, 'recall': 29.39, 'fmeasure': 35.6}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.89, 'recall': 5.78, 'fmeasure': 7.01}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.8, 'recall': 13.54, 'fmeasure': 16.4}}"
What is fracking?,"> Fracking is a process in which a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals is injected into the ground at high pressure to create fractures in the rock. The fractures allow the gas to escape from the rock and be collected. > > The process is used to release gas from shale rock formations deep underground. It is also used to extract oil from shale rock formations. > > The process is also known as hydraulic fracturing.","Fracking is short for ""hydraulic fracturing"". The process involves drilling a hole down to a layer of earth where there is natural gas, then pumping fluid into the hole at extreme pressures in order to fracture the stone and release the natural gas. It is only useful for particular rock formations that have lots of small pockets of natural gas that isn't easily accessed by other means. The main polution problem is apparently associated with dealing with the waste fluids after it as been used to fracture the rock. If the disposal wells are not properly sealed, they can leak up and into the water table (normally located at a much shallower depth than either the gas wells or waste wells), thus contaminating the drinking water. As with many things, it is safe as long as it is done properly, but not so much if the proper procedures are not followed. Picture oilfields as a sponge. Lots of little pockets of oil, instead of one massive underground 'tank' we can just suck out. To get into these little pockets, we drill a pipe into the formation and use explosive charges (or other more fancy tech) that poke little ~0.5"" holes in the pipe. Then we pump about 5000 gallons/minute through that hole, at crazy high pressure creating an effect like a really focused power washer on your mom's garden. This forces a crack into the formation, connecting all those little sponge holes to the pipe of our oil well. Sometimes this process is aided by Liquid Nitrogen, that expands as it goes down, giving it even more pressure at the bottom. Other times we run a slug of HCL to chemically soften the rock formation, making it easier to crack open. Now, this process is occurring 10,000ft++ below the surface, so the pressure is crazy high. Consider the extreme pressures you hear about at the bottom of the ocean, then remember it's deeper than that, and loaded with granite instead of water. That's the pressure the fracking pumps have to beat just to get the cracks open. If the pressure stops, those cracks will almost immediately seal up. To prevent this, immediately after the cracks have been formed we pump sand carried by gel down into the crack, which forces it to stay open. Since sand is very permeable, oil can flow freely through it to our pipeline. The gel carries a chemical that breaks it down within a few hours, and eventually makes its way up to the surface through the pipeline along with the oil. Most of the time this is Guar gel, and isn't too chemically different from using wheat flour to thicken a beef stew. It just cheaper and performs better at extreme temperatures and pressures. The cracks don't extend more than ~100ft from the pipeline. We know this because we can compare the volume of sand pumped down to the base diameter of the hole we blew open, and conservatively estimate the volume filled by the sand as a cone. Generally speaking, public water tables stop at ~100-200ft of the ground surface. Fracking is 10,000+, giving at least 800ft of solid rock between Fracking and Groundwater. It is incredibly unlikely that the two shall ever meet, and as far as I know they haven't. ~~~ What HAS happened is surface contamination. Small scale 'violations' occur almost every day when crews rig up and rig down, dribbling whatever chemical was in their hoses on the ground. These will fuck a farmer's backyard and grazing fields, but not likely a city's municipal water supply. The most ethical companies line a site with plastic sheeting and vacuum up any drippings, but that adds $1mil in cost, and is only as good as the crew applying it and actually doing what they're supposed to. Larger scale violations are some operations that have blatantly drained their runoff and (hazardous) wastewater tanks into the city sewer system, or some corner of a farm, hoping nobody would notice. This is patently illegal and amoral for so many reasons. Typically it's a ""discount hazardous waste disposal"" firm that's doing it for a bigger company, and usually the bigger company is included in the lawsuits for failing their due-dilligence. Other grey areas are the wastewater lakes for re-used water. See, the water that is pumped down into the formation comes back out a hazardous material and full of varying levels of nastiness. However, it doesn't become hazardous waste until it's actually waste. Most oilfield developers will re-use this water for ""tomorrow's"" fracking job, as it's still plenty good for that. That means the trucking/piping/transporting of that water with minimal spillage must be accounted for as well (read: more money). Also, it leaves you with wastewater that is even more hazardous than it was before. Typically this not-yet-wastewater is stored in engineered tanks or ponds that hold the bad stuff in to a reasonable (EPA certified) level, however, eventually someone will be responsible for draining that literal swamp. Usually that wastewater is pumped INTO an existing well in the center of a formation, which pushes oil OUT of surrounding wells. Once the stuff coming out is more water than oil, it's left 10,000ft underground, and won't be seen for a time measured on the geologic scale. Alternatively, there are ways to actually treat the water back to potable standards. It just requires processes and facilities tailored to the particular hazards of the water that aren't usually found at municipal water treatment plants. Drought-stricken farming areas have been kicking in for upgrades to their local water plants, as it actually can be cheaper to use local not-hazardous-anymore-but-expensively-treated water than trucking it in from elsewhere. ~~~ So, is Fracking safe? When working as-designed, yes. Of course there are things that can go wrong, but that's why local, state, and federal regulations require checks and constant monitoring. Having worked in the industry, I'm actually very pro-regulation, because I know the bosses will always put the business first. Without industry-wide regulation evening the playing field, someone will get over the moral issues of bad environmental practice in the name of cutting costs. The only downside to regulation is that it makes OUR oil more expensive to produce than countries that are less environmentally concerned, but I'm OK with that, because that just means keeping more in our borders. I should also note that Fracking has been tied to increased earthquakes. So far, most of the affected areas are also high-tornado areas, so their buildings are already ruggedized for those types of loads, which is why nothing has collapsed yet that wouldn't have anyway. However, the science isn't in yet on whether or not the more frequent earthquakes could be a good thing. See, we're about 60 years behind schedule for a massive New-Madrid earthquake, and there's now speculation that all of the little quakes could be easing the tension, preventing a massive snap that last made the Mississippi River flow backwards for a bit, and would certainly level most major cities between Louisiana and St. Louis. Its safety can be very controversial. Oil wells were first drilled straight down. After a while they learned to tilt the drill and drill at a slant. They became capable of turning a drill hole parallel to the layer with oil or gas. They learned to drill multiple holes from one drill site radiating out in the productive layer. They also learned to pack drill holes with sand, fluid, explosives, and nasty chemicals. Setting off the explosives resulted in fracturing the productive rocks. The sand slips in to keep the fracture open. The nasty chemicals also keep the cracks open. Because of these techniques it is now possible to get oil and gas from shale formations. More can be extracted. It is an oil and gas boom. Supposedly the well hole is sealed for a few thousand feet in the region which has our drinking water. So water wells should not become polluted. Actually water wells were polluted long before fracking. The roofs of well houses would pop off when the pump motor kicked on because of gas accumulation. There are cracks in the rocks. Anywhere you see quartz there is a crack in the rocks in which water seeped. Only a few thousand feet separate our aquifers and the oil or gas layers. Earthquakes happen all the time. So we may have set up a permanent future where aquifers and water wells are destroyed when the chemicals start leaching out. Drilling companies say they seal the hole. Actually at least 5 % of the seals fail within a number of years. We could say they will all eventually fail. It is just a matter of time. Bedrock is not a dense compact material. However it is more like lots of densely packed rocks. And between these there is cracks and openings for gas and liquids to get in. When you drill a well you get some of these cracks and can get the gases and liquids in them. This will cause material from connected cracks to flow towards your well. However depending on the rock and the cracks in them this can be a very slow process. Or the cracks can even get clogged by silt or other materials. One way to get higher gas or liquid throughput is to drill more wells. This is why you might see lots of wells in close proximity to each other. But drilling wells cost money. A cheaper method is to pump liquid down into the well and actually open up the cracks even more. After some time you get small pieces of sand and gravel that locks the cracks open. So when you pump the liquid back up again the cracks stay open and you can get more gas or liquid from the same well without drilling more. This is a technique which is hard to control and there is a lot of crossed fingers involved. You can not control the cracks in the rocks directly but have to rely on the rock to behave like you want it to. And in some cases you can open up the cracks too much and it can get though to nearby reservoirs that might be linked to the ground water. There is also worries about earthquakes since you are in fact moving bedrock and this can cause things to shift. We do have a lot of experience with this technology but not on the scale that we now see it being used.

Which is stronger?"," Squashing the bug. I'm a software engineer, and I've been working on a new product for a while now. It's been a lot of fun, but it's also been a lot of work.

","In states like California, the wooden homes can withstand earthquakes (and is cheaper than the other earthquake code approved material, steel reinforced concrete) because they're flexible and can bend a bit. So what homes are made of is going to depend on where you are. Are you on Long Island in New York? The houses will mostly be brick or cinder block with aluminum siding. Of course a house made of stone and concrete is going to last longer than a house made of wood. Stone houses from over 800 years ago are still standing. But wood and drywall work well enough, and they are less expensive, and most people arent building a house because they want something to span the centuries...its just a house. Cost and adaptability. Imagine you wanted to add an electrical outlet to your kitchen. If the house was made of stone you're going to spend most of the time chipping away at the wall, hoping not to do too much damage. While stone is great for longevity, it really adds to the cost of a house. Framing systems can be bought pre-fabricated from a host of manufacturers and erected in a couple of days. There's a local developer near me that can go from foundations to drywall in about 5 days if they're really trying. That's not including a wholly pre-fabricated house that is just dropped onto a concrete pad by tractor-trailer. So it's not a question of ""stronger"" it's ""strong enough"". If the house is rated for a 50 year lifespan, what's the value in shooting for 500? For most, 25 is good enough. First, the foundations for US homes are generally made out of concrete slabs with re bar emerging from the concrete to form the basis of attaching the rest of the frame to the slab. The base of the home is the most critical aspect in terms of stability and durability. Second, in tropical areas, it is much more common to build with cinder block and mortar. Most homes in Hawaii are built out of cinder block (not brick) because termites and the humidity/salt water/rain make wood a poor building material, prone to rotting and being eaten. It is more expensive to build with cinder block, however, because there is more labor involved and in the US labor is expensive. Building with bricks requires even more labor because the progress is slower, so it is fairly uncommon in new construction (most ""brick"" you see in new construction is ornamental and not structural). Most homes in other coastal areas have some sort of cement siding, such as stucco, to add stability and insulation, and to withstand the harsh sea air. As for the standard wood with drywall construction, as long as water, humidity and temperature are controlled (which almost every modern home does through HVAC systems, insulation, and proper drainage/roofing), the wood frame structure can last indefinitely. Many wood framed homes from the 1600s are still standing. Those home used much thicker wood, but they were also less protected/insulated than modern homes. Also, with a wood frame, you can remodel pretty much every part of the home if necessary relatively easily, including the wood framing (if necessary). Just take some scaffolding. Wood and drywall is more than strong enough to withstand standard weather, those things it will not withstand are storms like hurricanes and tornadoes that will destroy cement and brick nearly as easily as they destroy wood. You have to build a 4 foot thick wall with steel reinforcement that has no windows and only a single steel door to make an above ground tornado bunker. Wood is more vulnerable to fire, but it is far better at withstanding earthquakes. So that is a bit of a toss up. So we are down to price. Wood and drywall are much much cheaper than cement and brick. As much as 1/10 the cost of a cement or brick home. Wood homes are also much more user friendly. It is easier to make modifications, put in electric/plumbing/internet/phone etc, and do all kinds of things. I think one part of the answer is certainly that America still has a great deal of forest so wood products are probably significantly cheaper here than in India and some other parts of the world, like the middle east. Our wood products/timber industry has powerful influence in government too and it's in their interest to keep people building houses from wood. Concrete does a good job of staying (relatively) cool and temperature stable in hotter climates which along with cost, adds to its popularity in certain parts of the world. As was mentioned, Americans often do a modifications to their homes, i.e. open up walls to add power outlets or knock down walls and add rooms to a house. A wood framed house makes that much easier to do. Part of it is also tradition. Historically most homes in America have been built from wood. As someone who has traveled a fair amount around the world, I definitely see the benefits of concrete construction. If I were to build my own house from the ground up I would prefer it be concrete than wood.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 47.35, 'recall': 12.04, 'fmeasure': 19.19}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.0, 'recall': 2.03, 'fmeasure': 3.23}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.89, 'recall': 6.07, 'fmeasure': 9.69}}"
Why do we use fresh water for our sewage?,"Water is a good solvent, meaning it can dissolve a lot of things.

Why does the same radio station on FM and AM last much further out on AM?," Cause of the lower frequency, the signal can penetrate through buildings and other obstacles much better. The frequency of the radio station is 96.1 on FM and 96.1 on AM. I'm not sure why it's the same number. I'm just an ELI5 here, but I'll try. Think of radio waves like water waves. The water wave (the radio wave) has to move through air to get to you. If you're in a big pool, the water waves can travel a long way before they start to get weak. But if you're in a small pool, the waves get weaker quickly. The same thing happens with radio waves. They have to go through air to get to you. If the air is thick, the waves get weaker. If the air is thin, the waves can go farther. That's why AM radio works better on the coast.  s less air in the way, so the waves can go farther. That's why AM radio works better in the mountains.  s less air in the way, so the waves can go farther. That's why AM radio works better in the desert.  s less air in the way, so the waves can go farther. And that's why AM radio works better in the city.  s less air in the way, so the waves can go farther.  ","AM radio generally transmits around a frequency of 1 Mhz or less. FM radio generally transmits somewhere between 88 and 108 Mhz. Each FM photon has 100 times more energy than an AM photon (note: this is not the same as suggesting that the FM signals are automatically stronger because the power of the broadcasting tower will establish how many photons are sent out). Basically FM radio is mostly line of sight, the radio signals coming off the broadcasting tower more or less just shoot straight at you (straight at everything they can see from that vantage point) when you receive them they're basically coming in on a line between that broadcasting tower and you. As you get further away the tower passes beyond the horizon and you can't get the signal anymore. AM radio because each photon has less energy can both reach you by direct line-of-site like FM, but also the radio waves going upward into the sky cannot punch through the ionosphere well. The ionosphere is a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere, and it will reflect lower frequency radio waves back down to the earth extending their range considerably. With favorable conditions the signal can bounce multiple times off the atmosphere and then bounce off the earth and then the atmosphere again and travel very significant distances.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 35.62, 'recall': 36.56, 'fmeasure': 36.09}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.6, 'recall': 5.75, 'fmeasure': 5.68}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.17, 'recall': 17.62, 'fmeasure': 17.39}}"
How do people manage to customize otherwise normal vehicles (and normal engines) to produce hundreds more horsepower than what it was originally designed to produce?,"It's called a ""tune-up"" and it's a bunch of stuff that makes the engine run better. There are a bunch of different things that can be done to make an engine run better, but most of them are pretty cheap and simple.","Essentially adding power to any engine all comes down to getting more fuel and oxygen into the engine with each stroke. Their are several ways to do this: You can increase the size of the cylinders to allow more fuel & air in. This can be achieved by boring out the cylinders and increasing the diameter of each. You can can also ""stroke"" the engine, increasing the stroke length of the pistons and therefore the effective volume of the combustion chamber. You can increase the amount of fuel and air being delivered through efficiency boosters. This would be a head and cam swap, new intake manifold, or exhaust system. These mods allow air to move more efficiently into and out of the engine. More air, means you can put more fuel in, equals more power. The most efficient method is to use a power adder. This would be a turbo charger, supercharger, or nitrous oxide. Turbo chargers are essentially air compressors. They suck in air, compress it, and then inject it into the engine. Compressed air has more oxygen per cubic inch, so you can then add even more fuel to the cylinder (remember if there is not enough oxygen, then all of the fuel won't combust). The turbo is driven by the exhaust gases exiting the engine, so as rpm's increase, the turbo spins faster and boost increases. Turbos can get up to 40 or 50 psi of boost. A supercharger has the same effect as a turbo, but is less efficient. The difference being that superchargers are driven by a belt that is connected to the crankshaft. As the motor spins, it drives the compressor. Most superchargers develop 5-10 psi of boost, so by comparison, they are not as good as turbos. The one advantage a supercharger has is that it develops boost instantly. Turbo have to spool up before they start creating boost causing a delay after hitting the throttle; this is called turbo lag. Nitrous oxide is a supplement that can be added to the air/fuel mixture to boost power. NO2 has more oxygen in it than air: air is 21% O2 and NO2 is 33% O2. The extra 12% oxygen allows more fuel to be added. Lowering temperature of the air coming in also boosts power. Again, denser has more oxygen and cold air is denser than hot air. A cold air intake kit moves the air filter away from the hot engine bay and relocates it to an area that will allows colder air to be sucked in. You can also swap out the thermostat in the engine. The engine thermostat is a proportioning valve that controls the flow of coolant in the radiator system. You can swap to a lower temp thermostat that will keep the engine cooler, making the air around it cooler, which is the air being sucked into the engine. For engines with a turbo or supercharger, you can add an inter cooler. It act just like a radiator, but in this case it cools the air before it enters the engine, making it more dense. Most other mods beyond those I mentioned are support modifications designed to increase the strength of the components to withstand the increased stress and heat of adding more power. Most stock motors have a horsepower limit that can handled. Most regular engines might have 200 hp but are actually rated to handle up to 400 hp. In the case of a 2JZ, the stock motor was actually designed to handle way more power than 276 hp and is actually good for about 700 hp. Once you start pushing the limits of the engine components you risk damaging the engine. This is why most high horsepower builds end up swapping out most stock components such as pistons, rods, valves, etc. to uprated parts that can handle the stress and be more reliable. There are a few ways to produce more horsepower than stock: Forced Induction: done by attaching a supercharger or turbocharger that forces more air into the engine, and therefore, creates a more powerful explosion in the cylinders, and thus, more power Upgraded Internals: By upgrading parts such as the camshaft, cylinder heads, valves, and other parts, an engine can become more efficient than stock and be able to run at higher RPM, and therefore, more power. Exhaust: by adding a free-flowing exhaust, more power can be generated by removing back pressure from the cylinders, at the cost of more noise. ECU Tuning: by changing the code in a car's onboard computer, it is possible to influence the timing of the engine firing, the amount of fuel put into the cylinders, and the psi created by any forced induction. If any car is generating 2 or 3 times more than it's stock output, it is quite likely it has had all these things done to its engine and possibly more.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 68.89, 'recall': 3.77, 'fmeasure': 7.15}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.18, 'recall': 0.97, 'fmeasure': 1.85}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 51.11, 'recall': 2.8, 'fmeasure': 5.31}}"

why are American toilet pipes bigger?,"The toilet is designed to flush with the water pressure of the house.

The reason American toilets are designed to use 1.5 gallons of water per flush is that they are designed to use the water pressure in the house.

When microorganisms spoil food, they're more or less eating and pooping all over it. Sometimes the poop itself is nasty, sometimes the poop reacts with the rest of the food. Chemicals are changed and added - plus the more a bacteria eats, the sooner it can reproduce and work as a team to metabolise more food into poop. The alcohol in most drinks is yeast excrement - yum! *metabolism* is a $5 word for whatever your body does with food. Humans generally process food at the same rate all the time. Being warm blooded is the best. Bacteria, fortunately, get cold. They aren't warm blooded or even blooded at all. Most organic chemical reactions, like the ones used for metabolising food, work faster when temperatures are warm and slow down or don't work at all when things are colder. Your fridge cools food and bacteria down to the point that most microorganisms cant effectively digest/metabolize food. Depending on the reaction/organism/temperature/food bacteria may starve to death before they are able to eat enough to reproduce, so no bacteria can grow except maybe in short bursts if you leave the food on the counter or something. The same basic concept applies to molds, as well as chemical spoilage - milk IIRC spoils due to denaturation or reaction (breakdown) of milkfat molecules. Something like that. Anyways cold temperatures slow that reaction down too. Other types of spoilage like breads going stale happens when breads lose moisture over time (they come out of the oven moist with water, yeast alcohol, etc. For the most part, stale bread is just dried out. Alcohol evaporates way faster than water, and this is a large part of why genuinely fresh bread is so awesome compared to standard not-stale bread. Biological activity and chemistry is temperature dependent. By cooling things you slow the rate of reactions. That's really all there is to it. Its differently effective to different decay processes.

Why is a tunnel ever preferable to a bridge when crossing water?,"In a tunnel you have a solid structure that is not subject to the same forces as the water. Water is always moving and is subject to a lot of forces from the wind and the moon. You also have to account for earthquakes, which can cause water to move in unexpected ways. A bridge is more flexible than a tunnel, but it is also subject to the same forces. A bridge also needs to be able to withstand the weight of the water, which is a lot. A tunnel doesn't need to withstand the weight of the water. A tunnel is also more secure. You can't build a tunnel in the middle of a lake. You can build a bridge, but it's going to be a lot more expensive. A tunnel is also a lot cheaper to build. In the end, it comes down to money. A tunnel is cheaper, but it also takes a lot longer to build. A bridge can be built in a fraction of the time. The time it takes to build a tunnel is the most important factor. It's also more expensive. So if it's possible to build a bridge, it's usually cheaper to build a bridge. It's a lot easier to build a bridge. The tunnel is more expensive and it takes a lot longer to build.","In some cases shipyards, which often produce heavy water traffic with quite tall ships, are located near the desired location to build bridge/tunnel. So instead of building a drawbridge, or bridges that are extremely high to let ships pass through, tunnels are just built instead. Bridges have many drawbacks. They obstruct ships. They require strong foundations and some places have bad geology for that. They're exposed to the weather. They're visually intrusive. They often require large elevated approach roads. I'm not saying tunnels don't have drawbacks either. They're generally more expensive than bridges. They can have problems with bad geology too. Fire safety can be a serious issue. They can be difficult to build without damaging foundations of existing buildings. So depending on the exact situation, either a bridge or a tunnel might be chosen. Taking examples from New York City. The Lincoln Tunnel and Holland Tunnel both avoid blocking river traffic. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel might have been a bridge, but a tunnel was chosen; it does mean not much surface space is needed at either end. Had the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel been a bridge instead it would have basically destroyed Battery Park. When a bridge would be impossible, but a tunnel not impossible? Imagine trying to design a bridge over the English Channel. I can't imagine it would be an easy feat. It would probably require advances in materials science, to a science-fiction type level. In general, tunnels require less land area at the approaches/access ways. This is especially true for the very high bridges needed over navigable waters. This is why you see tunnels in large cities with navigable waters. Land is expensive and ship traffic is important to the economy. In addition to the answers given, another reason is that a bridge might interfere with a significant natural, cultural or tourist site. e.g. when Sydney wanted to build a second major harbour crossing, they didn't build a second bridge, they built a tunnel. Why? Because a second above-ground crossing would have cut a swathe through significant parklands and Circular Quay, and effectively severed the Opera House from the city. Plus cut through a whole bunch of expensive housing along the harbour. No way that was going to be practical.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 49.78, 'recall': 29.87, 'fmeasure': 37.34}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.17, 'recall': 7.29, 'fmeasure': 9.12}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.11, 'recall': 15.06, 'fmeasure': 18.83}}"
How does satellite navigation work?,"Satellites are in orbit around the Earth. They are equipped with atomic clocks. These atomic clocks are extremely accurate, and they are used to generate time signals that are broadcast to the Earth. These time signals are received by GPS receivers on the ground. These GPS receivers are equipped with a computer that can use the time signals to calculate the position of the satellite in orbit. The GPS receiver also knows the position of the Earth's surface, so it can use this information to calculate its own position on the Earth's surface. This is done by calculating the distance between the receiver and the satellite, and then using this distance to calculate the receiver's position. The GPS receiver can also use this information to calculate the speed and direction of the receiver, and this information can be used to track the receiver's position over time. The GPS receiver can also use this information to calculate the speed and direction of other GPS receivers on the Earth's surface, and this information can be used to track the position of other GPS receivers. This information is broadcast to other GPS receivers on the Earth's surface. This is done by transmitting the information on a special frequency, and then broadcasting this information to all other GPS receivers on the Earth's surface.  ","If you know the distance between you and one satellite (whose position you know) then you could be anywhere on a sphere centered on that satellite with a radius of that distance. If you know the distances to two satellites then you could be anywhere in a circle: draw a triangle between you and the two satellites and that triangle is free to rotate around the line between the two satellites. If you know the distances to three satellites then you can only be in one of two positions: draw a triangluar pyramid between the three satellites and you and either that pyramid points down to your position on Earth or it points up into space. You can safely assume that you're on the ground. ****** That just uses three satellites and doesn't answer the question about clocks, though. The fourth satellite comes in to answer that question: your phone doesn't have an accurate enough clock to work with just three satellites, so rather than judging time by looking at the incoming time vs the phone's time you look at the incoming times compared to each other. Using this method if you receive one satellite you just know what time it is (with some error, since you don't know how far away that satellite is). With two satellites you know what time it is (again, with error) and how much farther you are from one satellite than the other. When you work out the consequences of this constraint you're left with a hyperbolic surface. The shape isn't important here; the important thing to note is that you get a surface, just like how in the first example one satellite gave the surface of a sphere. With three satellites you know one more piece of information. The result is that you could be anywhere on a line (just like how with the original example two satellites gives you a circle—just a line that's closed in on itself). Finally, with four satellites you get enough information that there's only one point that is consistent with all of the information you receive","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.69, 'recall': 28.21, 'fmeasure': 34.59}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.78, 'recall': 3.64, 'fmeasure': 4.47}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.35, 'recall': 12.85, 'fmeasure': 15.75}}"

What's the point of changing gear transmission in manual cars? What actually happens to the car when you do so?,"There's really only one type of electricity. The difference is in how it's generated. AC is generated by a rotating magnet, DC by a moving coil. AC is used for power transmission over long distances, DC for power transmission over short distances. The AC power grid is huge and very efficient, it's used to power entire cities. DC power transmission is used for things like trains and electric cars. DC is used because the voltage of a battery is DC. So if you want to charge a car battery, you use DC power. AC is used in the car to power the motor. So you need to convert the DC power from the battery to AC power to power the motor. The conversion is done by a device called an inverter. It converts the DC power from the battery to AC power that can be used by the motor. The inverter is controlled by a computer that reads the speed of the motor and adjusts the AC power accordingly. When the car accelerates, the speed of the motor increases and the inverter adjusts the AC power accordingly. When the car decelerates, the speed of the motor decreases and the inverter adjusts the AC power accordingly. This is how the car is able to control the speed of the motor.","Gear ratio is the way to express how many times the engine crankshaft turns around itself for one full turn of the drive wheels. This is what you change when you change gears. The engine has a limited RPM range that you have to work on. If you keep it in first gear all the time, you have a hard top speed limit due to hitting the RPM redline above which your engine is damaged. If you keep it in the highest gear all the time, you cannot get your car to start rolling because it's a lot harder for the engine to turn the wheels in that ratio. If you have ever ridden a bicycle with gears it is the same principle. The lowest gear on a flat road has you turning the pedals many many times to make progress. As you move up the gears you turn the pedals at a slower rate to make the same progress.

Why does every car that I've ever heard have a different sound in reverse?,"Because they all have different exhausts. The exhaust pipe is where the engine's exhaust gases exit the vehicle.

The exhaust system is made of a series of pipes that are attached to the engine, transmission, and muffler. The exhaust pipe is the final part of the exhaust system.

","It's the reverse gear. Most of the gears in your car are cut with helical teeth because they're much soother and more efficient.

A part of that efficiency loss is the whining or whirring sound you hear when the car reverses. You can see the difference [here]( URL_0 ). All of the gears have teeth cut at angles, except one on the left side, next to the biggest gear on the left (which is 1st gear), which likely means that particular gear is reverse. You mean different from when you drive forwards? This is due to the construction of the transmission. The forward gears are helical, meaning their cogs are cut not straight, but sort of ""diagonally"". This reduces the noise they make by a lot, but limits the amount of torque they can withstand. The reverse gear, however, is cut straight, which creates more noise, but makes it stronger.

What is difference between arguments and parameters?,"- Parameters are values passed to a function when it is called.

If you look at the function signature (i.e. the name of the function and the values it takes) then the first part of the signature is the parameter and the second part is the argument. The difference is that a parameter is an input that you use to define a function and an argument is an input that you pass to a function. For example: function add(a, b) { console.log(a + b); } function multiply(a, b) { console.log(a * b); } function divide(a, b) { console.log(a / b); } In this example, the first two functions are defined with two parameters (a and b) and the third function is defined with two parameters (a and b) and one argument (a).

Why does ISS cargo and soyouz take so long for rendezvous?,"The ISS is in a very high orbit, so the Soyuz needs to travel a long way to get there.

The ISS is also in a very stable orbit, so the Soyuz needs to be very accurate to get there. The Soyuz uses an automated computer to guide it to the ISS.

"In cars, why does oil need changed, rather than just refilled like other fluids?","The oil in your engine is used as a lubricant to keep the engine running smoothly. It is not a fluid that is used as a fuel source, it is not like the gasoline or diesel fuel that you put in your tank. The oil is used to lubricate the engine, and if it becomes dirty or contaminated, it will not lubricate the engine properly. The oil in your engine will also break down over time, and this will affect the performance of your engine. If the oil is not changed, it will eventually become dirty and contaminated, and the engine will not run smoothly. It is important to change the oil in your engine regularly to ensure that it is clean and lubricating the engine properly.","Engine oil wears out. It also becomes contaminated with byproducts of combustion, dirt and debris. Oil is made from long chains of hyrdocarbon molecules and other compounds. This makes oil thick and allows it to keep moving parts from rubbing directly on each other under pressure and heat. But those moving parts eventually chop up the molecules, making them shorter and less able to keep moving parts from each other. The parts will rub more, increasing wear and friction. Oil is also intended to capture and hold harmful contaminants, like partially burned hydrocarbons, moisture, dirt and tiny pieces of metal from engine wear. Some contaminants are removed from the oil by the oil filter. But others remain suspended. Eventually the contaminants build up so much the oils ability to lubricate and protect is compromised. The contaminants are removed when the oil is drained and fresh oil is added. In cars, oil doesn't run out with normal use (it might run out due to leaks), so the same oil is reused day in, day out, which causes it to pick up dirt over time. Other fluids e.g. petrol are consumed when the car is running and just need to be refilled. Let me compare car oil to fryer oil, and petrol to ketchup. In a fast food restaurant, the fryer oil is reused for multiple batches of fries, up to a day or even a few (ew). The same vat of oil can be reused just like car oil.

In earlier days when automobile safety standards were still coming into existence and traffic flow-related science was emerging, it was inconvenient for American civil engineers to cross the Atlantic ocean and consult the growing popularity and expertise of European engineers. Roundabouts have many attractive features, but without as much input from proponents earlier on in city planning, American city planners went with the basic, easy and efficient square grid layout of cities, which forced road intersections to use squared up signaled intersections. Change away from this in North America is somewhat slow, and moreso in dense areas because roundabouts can have a larger and oddly shaped footprint on the land around them, making a change expensive. Roundabouts also have different rules than signaled intersections, which will force drivers to think differently about what they're doing. The most important thing for a road to have for a driver to use it easily, is predictability. If they don't understand how a roundabout works, it will cause confusion, which causes accidents. Because plenty of Americans are uncomfortable with roundabouts or don't want to learn how they work, they'll try to avoid them or resist having them built. They take up more space than a standard cross or T intersection without providing sufficient benefit to merit that space. They are not friendly to pedestrians because there is no pause in traffic. Without having a pulse of traffic you make it harder to control traffic farther down the road. It's a vicious circle. They're rare which means drivers are unfamiliar with them which means public unpopularity and possible raised accident rates which means they're less attractive to city planners which means they stay rare. Historically, one problem is that early traffic circles often had different rules. For example, in many cases traffic on the circle was expected to yield to traffic wanting to join. That's a disaster - it lets the circle fill up with gridlocked traffic to the point that often police directions were required to disperse it. Also many circles were built large and meant for high-speed traffic, yet nonetheless not really built large *enough* for the intended speeds. The design of modern roundabouts, including the importance of the rule that traffic that wants to enter must yield, was only properly worked out in the 1960s in the UK. By that date the above problems had already spoiled the reputation of circles in the USA. Another contributing factor may be that US cities usually have strong grid layouts, and their simple right-angle crossroads work well with traffic lights or yield/stop signs. By contrast the older road networks of the UK and Europe often have roads meeting at unusual angles, or have five or more roads coming together into a single point, and roundabouts work especially well in those situations compared to other junction types. (EDIT: For example the roundabout nearest to me has exits at 2 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 7 o'clock, and 10 o'clock. Imagine that as an all-way-stop intersection.

What prevents water from flooding houses with chimneys,"Water floods houses because of gravity. The water falls from the sky, and gravity pulls it down. In the US, the water tends to run off into the ground, and then flows into rivers and lakes, and eventually back into the ocean. But in other places, the water can collect in low-lying areas, and flood houses. This is why some places have drainage ditches and canals, and some places have flood walls and levees. The purpose of these structures is to keep the water out of the houses.","Chimneys generally have a [chimney cap]( URL_0 ) that keeps the rain out. Separately, drain vents or ""plumbing stack"" vents (also coming up through the roof) are often open to the air without a cap, but that's ok because they lead vertically down to a sewage drain pipe.

How do combination locks work?,"Combination locks work by having a series of gears that are connected to each other. When you turn the dial, it moves the gears in a specific way. The gears are set up so that they will only align in a specific way, which means that you need to turn the dial in a specific way to get the gears to align. This means that the combination is a specific sequence of turns, and if you turn the dial in any other way, you won't be able to align the gears. When you turn the dial in the correct way, it will move the gears to the correct position, and then the lock will open.","[This ]( URL_0 ) should help you out Just to provide a written answer... There's an axle that begins on your dial and goes through the center of several parallel disks (there's one for each number). But only the last disk is actually attached to this axle, all other disks in-between are loose. Each disk has a cutout notch. The disks' edges are dragging on a movable metal pin or tab (parallel to the axle) being pushed towards the disks by a spring. To defeat the lock, all disks' notches have to be aligned, which makes a straight gap going through the disks, and allows the pin/tab to slip inside said notches. So, when you start turning the dial, only the last disk moves. Somewhere on its surface there's a pin that's supposed to make contact and attach to a small tab on the surface of the next disk. When that happens, this next disk also starts moving. This pin/tab mechanism between each disk is made in a way that allows the attachment to happen in just one direction, this direction being inverted on each subsequent disk. But when one more disk gets ""picked"", all previous pin/tab attachment will stay locked for both directions. That's how the lock controls the alternating rotation. Therefore as you input each correct number on the correct direction, one more disk starts moving alongside your dial and all previously dialed disks are guaranteed to be kept on the right position, rotating as a whole. When you're entering the last number, you're actually rotating all disks as a single cylindrical pack with the notches perfectly aligned. If you move the dial on the wrong direction at any time, any previous pin/tab attachment will detach and you'll be back to moving only the first disk. The whole combination of the lock is given by the position of the pin relative to the notch on each disk.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 59.48, 'recall': 20.85, 'fmeasure': 30.87}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.7, 'recall': 3.03, 'fmeasure': 4.49}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.9, 'recall': 11.18, 'fmeasure': 16.55}}"
"What is a car engine really doing when it is ""warming up""?"," Cars have engines that run on gasoline. When the car is on, the engine is always running, even when you are just sitting at a stop light. However, it is still doing a few things to prepare for the car to move. It is doing the following: * Checking the oil and coolant levels.   oil to run and coolant to run cool. * Checking the fuel levels.   fuel to run. * Checking the temperature.   to be at the right temperature to run. If it is too hot, it will burn too much fuel and be too hot for the engine to run. If it is too cold, it will not run well. * Checking the air filter.   air to run.

Moreover there are other fluids (oil for example) which are less viscous when warmer than ambient temperature, and when it happens motors work better. Well, first off you don't need to warm up the engine of a modern car. They are designed and built to such a fine tolerance you can simply turn them on and drive under normal operating conditions year round. As to what they are doing they are literally warming up, or getting hotter. Since the engine is made of metal which expands slightly when heated the parts of the engine will expand a bit, and the main engine components (the block and head, or lower and upper part of the engine) will expand enough to float off each other a bit when they get fully heated. This isn't a worry because the parts have a gasket between them designed to make a proper seal so no oil or radiator fluid leak out. This has been a problem in the past, some engines from the 70's and 80's that leaked notoriously did because newer materials expanded at unpredictable rates. We are well past the days of those exotic (for the time) alloys and early aluminum head/cast iron block hybrids.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 27.86, 'recall': 24.03, 'fmeasure': 25.81}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.5, 'recall': 3.88, 'fmeasure': 4.17}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.92, 'recall': 13.73, 'fmeasure': 14.75}}"
How do tanks turn?,"Tanks have a big problem when it comes to turning. They have a big mass and big size. This means that the turning radius is big. This means that if you want to turn left or right, you need to move the tank a long way. This is very hard to do. You can’t just move the wheels left or right. The wheels are the same size as the tank. So you need to move the whole tank to turn. This is very hard. It’s like trying to turn a big rock. It takes a lot of effort to move it. So, to turn a tank, you need to use a special way of turning called a crab turn. You know when you’re driving a car and you want to turn left, so you turn the wheel left and the car turns left. Well, tanks don’t work that way. They have a special way of turning called a crab turn. It’s called a crab turn because it looks like a crab. When a tank wants to turn left, it doesn’t turn its wheels left. It turns its wheels right. It’s like it’s turning the wheels of a crab. When it wants to turn right, it turns its wheels left.

"How are ""scratch and sniff"" stickers made?"," Scent is made up of molecules in the air, so it's not hard to imagine that a chemical compound, like any other substance, can be made into a sticker. However, the molecules in a sticker are much smaller than those in the air, and the air has a lot more of them. This means that the molecules in a sticker need to be more concentrated than the ones in the air. To make a sticker smell, you need to make a chemical compound that smells like what you want the sticker to smell like, and then put that compound into a sticker. The molecules in the sticker are small enough that they can't be seen with the naked eye. This means that the sticker will have a lot of small holes in it. These small holes will let the air in, which will then let the smell of the sticker out. The sticker will smell more than it would if it were just a solid substance because the small holes will let more of the smell molecules out.","Scratch-and-sniff stickers are one of those novelty technologies that sound like such a good idea... But they never really caught on except in children's books and the occasional perfume strip in a magazine. Why shouldn't nasal information be just as important audio and visual information? Perhaps because no one has figured out how to encode language in smells. Nonetheless, if you have kids, you probably have a scratch-and-sniff book around the house. And even if the book is 20 years old, it still works! The reason the stickers last so long is because of the microencapsulation technology used to create them. The basic idea behind scratch-and-sniff is to take the aroma-generating chemical and encapsulate it in gelatin or plastic spheres that are incredibly small -- on the order of a few microns in diameter. When you scratch the sticker, you rupture some of these spheres and release the smell. The smell is essentially held in millions of tiny bottles, and you break a few of the bottles every time you scratch the sticker. The tiny bottles preserve the fragrance for years. -howstuffworks","{'rouge1': {'precision': 37.78, 'recall': 35.79, 'fmeasure': 36.76}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.59, 'recall': 5.29, 'fmeasure': 5.43}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.44, 'recall': 18.42, 'fmeasure': 18.92}}"

why do most electronics run on 110 or 220 volt systems? Is there something special about 110 and multiples of 110?,"The answer is simple, it’s because the power grid is set up that way. In the US, 110v is the standard for household power. It’s the voltage that’s used to power everything in your house, from your lights to your stove to your TV. 220v is the standard for industrial power. It’s used to power big machines, like industrial machinery in factories. The reason it’s not used in homes is that it’s dangerous. It’s a lot more dangerous than 110v, and it’s only used in industrial settings. 110v is safe enough that it can be used in homes, and it’s the standard voltage for most of the world.","Most electronics dont run on that voltage but use an internal (or like laptops or phones in the chargers components) transformer to step it into the actual voltage required. For the US the 110 is just what we decided to convene as the norm. For devices that require more (say an electric oven or range) they are wired into 2 different ""phases"" each receiving 110 so they add to 220. So your power company energizes the lines at a high voltage/low amperage setting to travel miles on the poles. A local transformer changes that into a few phases of 110 volt supplies, regulated by your electrical panel. Each slot in your panel is from one of these phases, alternating each spot. A single breaker pulls from one phase and supplies those wires in your house with 110. A two pole breaker receives one from each phase and supplies 2 lines of 110 for a 220 total. Your standard receptacles supply your standard plug with 110, and an in line transformer (the larger block somewhere in your charging cable) turns this into what your device uses. Devices designed to operate in your region (presuming the US) will either be engineered to run on these standards, or have some transformer in them to go from the 110 ac to the devices preferred voltage. For your standard cellphone as an example turns 110 ac into a near single digit voltage at 1 or 2 amps. Edit for source: Handful of years as electrician, and many more of repairing my home electronics When electricity started, Edison was using 110V/220V DC at homes to light them. The voltage had to be at leas 110V to drive the lamps. When the war of currents ended, America stayed with the 110V but now AC and the rest of the world started using 220V since the higher the current the smaller electricity loses during delivery, thats why power lines are using thousands of volts to deliver electricity over bigger distances. 110V was needed to drive the lightbulbs, 220V came up because Edison was installing 3 cables +110V, 0V, -110V, so u could use 110 or 220 depending on the circuit. You clearly live in the USA. Electrical power in the USA is supplied as 60 cycles per second alternating current from three phase power lines. These lines are out of phase with each other by 120 degrees. That kind of power only gets delivered to industrial sites which require a lot of electrical power. Somewhere near your home is a transformer. There the voltage from the lines is stepped down to the 220 volts. This voltage is relative to the two power lines. Relative to a neutral line the voltages are only 110 volts. These two power lines come to your house along with the neutral and connect to your load center. Your high current devices, stove, clothes dryer, central AC, run on the 220 volts having those wires run to them through circuit breakers. Ordinary devices being powered from your wall sockets run on 110 volts, only one lead from the load box is run to them along with the neutral wire. It can be either one of the power lines. The load box is wired to keep the load roughly balanced between the two power leads. You have 220 to your house but each leg is 110 to the neutral wire. The neutral and one hot wire run to your outlets. It's actually 120/240 or 120/208 in 3 phase applications.. and peak voltage to ground is 171v cycling at 60 cycles/second 50 for the UK. Most electronics have built in transformers and bridge rectifiers. Transmission of power at these voltages is ineffectime that is why the power lines up top of the poles is usually 14.4kv then small transformer's on the poles for local distribution. It's just a standard that was developed like 277/480 in the USA and 347/600 in canada","{'rouge1': {'precision': 65.81, 'recall': 11.56, 'fmeasure': 19.67}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.66, 'recall': 2.56, 'fmeasure': 4.35}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.32, 'recall': 6.91, 'fmeasure': 11.75}}"
"How can I tell if my Earphones are the wrong way around just by the music I'm listening to, even when I've never heard the song before.","Your ears are not in the middle of your head.

If it's coming out of your left ear, it's probably your right ear.","Sound guy here. If you're listening to a band, it is very common for an engineer to pan the drums from the drummers perspective in the mix. From hi-hat on the left, to the floor tom and ride on the right. Ie a drum roll goes from snare to light tom - middle tom - floor tom, left to right. If it goes from right to left, you have the stereo flipped. So, here's how it works: Mixing engineers pan individual audio tracks left and right all the time. A very large part of the sounds you hear will be panned, albeit subtly so the track as a whole doesn't sound disjointed. Most people cannot tell at all. This is the point, really. After panning, many engineers use digital tools to ""fill out"" the track. Some songs will have more pronounced panning of sounds. An interesting example I can think of is ""I Want Wind To Blow"" by The Microphones URL_0 Or ""On The Run"" by Pink Floyd URL_1 However, if you just wanna know how to tell them apart quickly... Most decent headphones and earbuds have a marking on the inside or outside that tells you which is the left side and/or which is the right side. Many headphones and earbuds only fit snugly one way. You can always test it with your audio mixer in your smart phone or laptop by moving the audio fader all the way to one channel and see which side the audio comes from. If you had been listening to an old recording from the early days of stereo mixes you might have noticed that drums were typically panned right, lead instruments left, and others (including vocals) panned hard left or right. If you've listened to enough you come to expect the drums on the right, so you would quickly notice if they were on the left. However, you said this was a contemporary recording, and few people mix tracks in this style anymore. I listened to the first 10 seconds of the first few songs of that album on my crappy speakers at work (which is all I cared to listen to) and didn't notice anything immediately that would sound off if switched. Drums these days are usually plotted from the drummer's perspective, as /u/amygdaladefekta mentioned, but not always (You've probably heard it from audience perspective enough for it to not be disconcerting). Seems like this album does use drummer perspective, at least from the little I heard, so it's a possibility. My guess is that there is some subtle difference in your earphones that you have grown accustomed to. If they're not reference quality monitors then there's a decent chance the quality control during manufacture isn't *that* high and there could be some physical difference between the drivers that affects the sound slightly, or some wear'n'tear or just some earwax buildup unevenly affecting things. Your brain would grow used to hearing that particular color coming from each ear - you wouldn't notice it normally, but when it's backwards you do.

Why do fans usually have 5 blades instead of more?,"Fans with more blades are more efficient. Fans with more blades have more air passing through them, and therefore more air being pushed out.

"Why can cool drinks stay ""cool"" longer than hot drinks in the same insulated travel container, for example, an insulated tumbler or thermos.","[The question is in reference to the fact that you can keep a hot drink hot for a longer time, but you can't keep a cold drink cold for a longer time. The question is why this is the case, and what causes the difference in temperature retention between hot and cold drinks.  ","My guess would be the difference between ambient and what it is you're trying to keep temperature controlled. A nice, cold drink may be at maybe 35-40°F. Ambient in a temperature-controlled office environment or a nice day might be 60-70°. So that leaves a difference of 20-35° for a cold drink. Compare that to keeping a hot drink at 160-185°F. The delta with ambient in this case would be 90-125°, far greater than the difference in the cold case. The larger difference means temperature of the hot drink will fall faster compared to how fast the cold drink warms up. Of course, being in hotter weather will shift this, but the difference doesn't hit even until you reach over 95°F. Most people don't stay out in that temperature for very long. The rate of heat transfer through a barrier directly relates to the temperature difference across that barrier. Say the outside temperature is 20 C and you have a cold drink at 5 C and a hot drink at 95C, then the temperature differences are 15 and 75 C respectively. That means the hot drink will lose heat five times as fast as the cold drink gains heat, at least to start with. Let's say you have a container of hot water at 180 degrees and another container with cold water at 35 degrees. If the outside air is 75 degrees, that's a difference of 105 degrees between the hot container and the outside and 40 degrees between the cold container and the outside. Since the hot container has a larger gradient of heat between it and the outside air, heat will flow away from the hot container faster than the cold container will absorb heat. Just like if you had a room of hot air, if you open the door to a room of cold air, the heat rushes out very quickly. But if you have a room of warm air, it flows more slowly to the cold room. Add to what others have said, the cold drink usually comes with ice in it which is intended to keep the drink cool longer. On the other hand the hot drink does not come with heated rocks in it to keep it hot longer. Then add condensation to the scenario. Here is a [school lesson]( URL_0 ) about two cold cups of water, one of which is inside a plastic bag: > The cup inside the bag should have very little moisture on it because not much water vapor from the air was able to contact it. The cup exposed to air should have more moisture on the outside because it was exposed to the water vapor in the air, which condensed on the outside of the cup. When condensation takes place, on the cup outer surface the water vapour present in the atmosphere becomes water particles there by releasing its latent heat. This helps to keep the cup cooler. This does not happen with a hot cup of water.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 77.78, 'recall': 8.19, 'fmeasure': 14.81}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.98, 'recall': 1.76, 'fmeasure': 3.19}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 46.3, 'recall': 4.87, 'fmeasure': 8.82}}"
"The relationship between the clutch, the accelerator and the brake in a car","is such that when you press the accelerator, the clutch disengages and the power is transmitted to the wheels. - When you press the brake, the clutch disengages and the power is transmitted to the wheels. The clutch is a device that connects and disconnects the engine from the transmission. It is used to control the power transmitted to the wheels and also to control the speed of the car. The accelerator is a pedal that you press to make the car move faster. The brake is a pedal that you press to make the car slow down or stop. The clutch is used to make sure that the engine and the transmission are in sync. This is important because if the engine and transmission are not in sync, the car will not move smoothly and will jerk. When you press the accelerator, the clutch disengages and the power is transmitted to the wheels. This makes the car move faster. When you press the brake, the clutch disengages and the power is transmitted to the wheels. This makes the car slow down or stop. The clutch also helps to prevent the engine from stalling. When you press the accelerator, the engine gets more power and it can start to speed up. If the clutch is not disengaged, the engine will speed up too much and will stall.  ","The clutch slips to allow you to apply less than 100% of the engine's torque to the transmission. Depending on the gear selected, the engine might not be able to apply enough torque to propel the car without stalling (exceeding the engine's maximum torque). You can press the accelerator to increase engine speed, which also increases maximum torque. The balancing act of starting a manual car is to apply enough accelerator to keep then engine speed up while not letting the clutch out far enough to stall the car. As the car starts moving you can let the clutch out farther, as momentum will help keep the engine from stalling. You need to learn this as a muscle memory behavior, like shooting a basketball, because when you are driving you also have to look around and steer the car so you don't hit anything. - Accelerator pulls on the throttle and increases the speed of the engine. - Clutch disengages the gear from the engine; putting the car into neutral. - Brakes pushes the brake fluid into the brake pads; clamping the brake disc and as a result slowing the car down. When you're in first gear (with clutch in), the gear is disengaged and if you release it too quickly, your clutch grabs the gear instantly causing a jerk reaction which will cause you to stall because you're at a too low speed. When you're in a higher gear and you do this, your engine is spinning fast enough where the car won't stall; however you will feel the entire car jerk and somewhat pull you back. Novice drivers sometimes panic and hit the brakes which causes them to stall anyway. When you do release the clutch slowly while applying the gas/accerlerator, it gives the clutch a chance to ease into gear while when perfected; is so smooth that you won't even notice the change. ----------------------------- When you brake; it slows down the engine speed to the point where the higher gear spins at a speed where it wasn't designed to drive at (basically too slow for the gear) and so the car shakes voilently as it comes to a near stall speed. Most instructor will want you to stay in 5th/4th and slow down at the moment where it's about to stall before you engage the clutch (disengage the gear) and comes to a standstill and so you might want to practice that to pass your test. When you do drive on your own however, it saves your brake pads if you drop down a gear and let the engine do the braking. - Lower gears delivers more power but at the same time drops power more quicker than the higher gear; so putting a lower gear on and letting go of the accelerator will automatically slow the car down without the brakes. **Personal note**: Downshifting without using the brakes will cause this jerk reaction if the car is at too high of a speed. You can circumvent through this by simply engaging the clutch, blip your accelerator so the revs go higher (2-3k revs depending on the car) before releasing the clutch and doing your clutch accelerator method. **This lets you slow down without even using the brakes, however DO NOT DO THIS ON YOUR TEST!!!!!!!!!!!!**. -edit- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** WHEN I SAY DROP TO A LOWER GEAR; I MEANT 5 > 4 > 3; NOT 5 > 2.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 69.03, 'recall': 27.08, 'fmeasure': 38.9}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 20.89, 'recall': 8.17, 'fmeasure': 11.75}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.96, 'recall': 13.72, 'fmeasure': 19.7}}"
"Is it possible to write an algorithm that corrects a low-quality speaker to sound good? If so, why is it not done?","If you are talking about speech recognition, then yes it is possible to use algorithms to correct speech. If you are talking about audio playback, then it is possible to use algorithms to correct audio. In either case, the algorithms are called noise reduction algorithms. These algorithms take the audio signal and compare it to a reference signal, and then they try to correct the audio signal to make it sound like the reference signal. The algorithms can be very sophisticated, and they can be used to correct a wide range of problems, including things like background noise, distortion, and other problems. The algorithms can also be very complex, and they can be very difficult to implement.","It's not quite that simple, yes you can fix a nonlinear response with an equalizer, but you also need to deal with distortion. With a cheap speaker you might put in one frequency, and get a whole bunch of weird frequencies out, due to the resonances of the different parts the speaker is made of. There's also the issue of quality control, with cheap speakers you might not have perfectly consistent manufacturing, so you might need individual calibration data for each speaker coming off the line, that can get expensive. If you want to calibrate it after installing it at home, you'd need a microphone that's been well characterized, and the device playing your music needs to be able to do the signal processing required to correct all the speaker's deficiencies. That would probably require some engineering to model the behavior of the speaker, or maybe continuous feedback from a microphone into the signal processor. (say some of your distortion is caused by one of the panels of your enclosure vibrating, you might know the frequency at which it vibrates from the initial calibration, but to dampen it out you need to know the phase, so your correction interferes destructively with that vibration instead of interfering constructively and making the distortion worse) Also, the speaker's characteristics might change as the speaker ages, absorbs moisture from the air, with changes of air pressure, etc. Finally, maybe the people making cheap speakers don't have the motivation or expertise to pull something like this off, while the people making expensive speakers want to keep selling expensive speakers. You're also never going to fix stuff like the panels of a speaker box rattling because it wasn't glued properly.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 35.9, 'recall': 14.33, 'fmeasure': 20.49}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.59, 'recall': 1.03, 'fmeasure': 1.47}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.66, 'recall': 7.85, 'fmeasure': 11.22}}"
Why can't you use suction to clean dust out of computer vents but compressed air cans are ok?,"'ll do my best to explain. When you use a vacuum cleaner, the suction is generated by the movement of the fan. The fan pushes air through the vacuum, creating a low-pressure area behind it. The air then rushes into the vacuum, creating the suction. This is why suction works so well for cleaning dust and debris from surfaces. However, when you use compressed air, the pressure is much higher than atmospheric pressure. This means that air molecules are moving much faster than they would be at atmospheric pressure. This is why compressed air works so well for cleaning dust and debris from small crevices. However, when you use compressed air to clean computer vents, the pressure is still relatively low. This means that the air molecules are moving at a much slower speed than they would be at atmospheric pressure. As a result, the air molecules are not able to penetrate deep into the crevices of the vents, and so the suction is not effective. When you use a compressed air can, you are essentially blowing air into the vent. The air molecules are moving so fast that they are able to penetrate the crevices of the vent and push the dust out.  ","It is a myth. Air flowing past electronics does not create enough static electricity to damage anything. The fans in the PC would be unsafe if that was true. The vacuum cleaner is more powerful, but is not ducted like the fans are. The only caution is to not cause the fans to run backwards and not to overspeed them because they can be damaged. I've been cleaning very expensive broadcast video equipment and PCs for 30 years with various vacuums. Some of this stuff costs over $100,000 and the manufacturers recommend vacuuming. Another thing is that the average compressed air can is about 10 Bar whereas atmospheric pressure is 1 Bar. That means that even with a total vacuum the biggest pressure differential you can get is 1 Bar, vs 9 Bar with the can. More pressure = more dust moving ability.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 26.83, 'recall': 38.19, 'fmeasure': 31.52}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.9, 'recall': 6.99, 'fmeasure': 5.76}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 12.68, 'recall': 18.06, 'fmeasure': 14.9}}"
What's to stop someone from broadcasting a radio frequency that is already taken by a local station?,"The local station has the right to use the frequency, and the person trying to broadcast on the frequency is infringing on the local station's rights. The local station can take legal action against the person. You can't just use someone else's radio frequency, you have to get permission from the radio station that owns it. You can't just use someone else's radio frequency, you have to get permission from the radio station that owns it. This is like if you were trying to use someone else's phone number.

Plus, he would need some powerful broadcasting equipment to disrupt the radio station over its whole area. That equipment is expensive to get and too big to hide. my high school electronics teacher was fond of answering similar questions with, ""but then they triangulate your signal and the big burly FCC guys show up at your door. "" My buddy likes to broadcast his favorite music, pirate style, but he does it from a truck and gets away with it. probably not enough range to ruffle any government feathers, just a few confused commuters from time to time ..trying to figure out why Rush Limbaugh suddenly dropped the bass. Amateur radio clubs sometimes have a contest called a ""fox hunt"" in which someone will set up a transmitter in a city (on a legally available frequency) and the rest of the club will try to locate it by tracking the signal. If amateurs can do it for weekend fun, a government law enforcement agency is gonna be more than capable. So here is a true story. I was on a military exercise in nirthern california. I am electronics technician and responsible for the operation and maintenance of RF (radio frequency) equipment. We were operating in the VHF portuon of the spectrum and had a single channel plain text (unencrypted) net set up using 89.7 mhz as the transmission frequency. At one point our primary net went down due to equipment failure and switched to the 89.7 mhz frequency. After operating on thatvnet for about 4 hours a helicopter was circling our position and 3 federal agents in government vehicles arrived at the entry control point of our basebin the field. We were told that we were interfering with a public broadcast and needed to cease operations on thay frequency immediately. Isn't there a malcom in the middle episode where hank tries doing that, and some government people chase him, because it's illegal The law. And that's about it. But you'd be surprised just how many legal hoops you have to jump through before the law is fine with you transmitting anything. That is ""pirate radio"". And nothing really stops someone from doing it, other than the fact that you'll get found and get in trouble with the FCC fairly quickly. Well, that and the initial cost of building a transmitter. nothing other than laws. if you did it one time, nothing would stop you. the station would report it to the FCC and they'll log it. if you keep on doing it, FCC will send a team to track you down and when they catch you, they'll toss you in jail for it. There is an old Christian Slater movie called [Pump Up The Volume]( URL_0 ) that explores this very topic. Can't say it's super accurate, but I remember it being a decent 80's ""Teen Angst"" type movie.. Someone actually does this on a small scale on the interstate by our house. AM station randomly turns to Bluegrass for a very short distance. Now what's really interesting is if you did this on the 2.4ghz spectrum with a big enough transmitter you'd shutdown wireless networks citywide. They'd probably also charge you with terrorism. Physically, nothing. Nothing at all. That said, there are people who will be upset by it, and will track it down and turn it in. That then leads to five-digit fines and potentially jail time. I assume that's why at night when your station turns into Mexican radio it's because they don't comply with FCC. I don't know why it seems to happen only at night either. Someone needs to ELI5. I once built a portable FM transmitter that runs off of a portable battery used to charge cellular devices. The range was about 100ft. The transmitter could broadcast on the entire FM and AM band, meaning I could set it to any popular station and everyone within 100ft would hear what I was broadcasting if they were on that particular frequency. As long as I'm moving I.e in a car, they will have difficulties tracking since they use the tri-locate method described in the comment section. P.S I made it as a prank to mess with a friend who loves alternative music, or rather, hates popular music. I put magnets on it and attached it underneath his car for a week. I made it play pop music on all of his favorite alternative stations.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 63.95, 'recall': 14.21, 'fmeasure': 23.26}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.28, 'recall': 2.72, 'fmeasure': 4.45}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.81, 'recall': 6.85, 'fmeasure': 11.21}}"

"How does wiring in work in electronics, and why are there so many different size and types of wire?","Wires are conductors. They carry electricity. Wires are made of metal.

Resistance is the measure of how much electricity is lost as it travels through a wire. The less resistance a wire has, the more electricity it can carry.

What is C and how is it different from the other types of programming?," ""C is a low-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs. It was designed to be portable, efficient, and easy to use. C is the basis for many other programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. It is still widely used today. C is a compiled language, meaning that the code is compiled into machine language before it is run. This makes C very fast and efficient. C is also a general-purpose language, meaning that it can be used to write programs for any purpose. C is a low-level language, meaning that it requires the programmer to write a lot of code to perform a task. This makes C more difficult to use than higher-level languages like Python. C is also a procedural language, meaning that it is based on procedures and functions. It is not based on objects like C++ and Java. C is a very powerful language, but it can also be very dangerous if not used properly. It is not recommended for beginners. C is a very powerful language, and is used in a lot of applications. One of the main reasons is that it is very fast. C code is compiled to machine code before it is run, which means that it runs faster than code that is interpreted by an interpreter. C is also very efficient.  ","Disclaimer: not an expert, I actually have no experience in C but I have a grasp of the concepts. Most common programming languages that you see or hear of today, be it Java, C++, or the web dev trio, HTML/CSS/Javascript, are what's known as 'high level languages' and typically go through several layers of abstraction before they're able to be executed by the machine directly. (For example, Java runs on another program called the JVM, which translates it's code into code for the platform it's running on, which is why it's so portable across operating systems) High-level languages generally abstract away concepts like pointers (which 'point' to a specific position in memory, which is helpful for remembering where you stored a value), and you're left with variable names which essentially do the same thing but don't have a lot of the difficulty associated with pointers. (These probably make up about half of those random letters and words, the other half being functions) C is a significantly lower-level language, but it also gives you more direct control over memory. You can directly manipulate segments of memory rather than having a memory management system do it for you. It's also commonly used in robotics because it's excellent for single-purpose tasks like translating a physical button into turning on a motor. Now, these definitions don't exactly answer your question. Programming is generally very structured and has specific naming patterns, and they can seem confusing or otherwise incomprehensible by the average layman. In low level programming such as C, you're generally going to see two major types of things being named: Pointers/Variables and functions. Functions are like mathematical functions, except that they can be called any time and can obviously do a lot more than just mathematics. Variables, or pointers in lower-level languages, basically store directions to getting a specific value in memory. These values can be simple, like a number or a boolean (true/false value), but they can also be more complex, carefully ordered structs (To people who know C, C has structs, right?) which can contain many values. Now, functions and variables can be named just about anything, and C's standard libraries (the functions which ""come with"" C) often have very confusing naming schemes. It's a matter of having the proper documentation on hand. Learning programming can be a tricky task, but there's many ways to get help and resources.

How do wooden sea ports not rot and fall apart over time?,"Most of the time it's not wood, it's concrete or steel. The wood is used to make the pilings that the concrete or steel are poured around. Wood is very good at resisting rot and decay, and when it's submerged in water, it's even better. The wood is also protected by the water itself. The water acts as a barrier, preventing air from getting to the wood and allowing the wood to dry out. The wood also acts as a sponge, absorbing water and releasing it slowly. This helps to keep the water level consistent, and prevents the wood from getting too wet or too dry. The wood is also protected by the weight of the concrete or steel.

What is happening when I change gears in my manual transmission?,"The gears are essentially clutches that engage and disengage from each other. When you shift into a lower gear, you are essentially slowing down the engine speed and allowing it to spin the wheels faster. This is done by the gear ratio, which is the ratio of the speed of the engine to the speed of the wheels. If you're in a higher gear and you press the clutch, the engine speed slows down and the wheels speed up. If you press the clutch in a lower gear, the engine speed increases and the wheels slow down. When you shift into a lower gear, the engine speed slows down, but the wheels speed up. This is what allows the car to move forward. When you shift into a higher gear, the engine speed increases, but the wheels slow down. This is what allows the car to accelerate.

Reverse adds a further cogwheel to the system so that the rotation of the motor gets transmitted backwards to the wheels. Manual transmission requires you to disengage the gear before engaging the next. That's what you do with the clutch. You ""disconnect"" the motor turning cogwheel from the wheel's turning cogwheel. Select appropriate cogwheel (gear) release the clutch so cogwheels are ""connected"" again and motor rotation is transmitted Automatic transmission forces the gears to slip to the next one whenever the motor reaches a certain number of rpm.

How is tap water not full of mold and algae when nobody cleans the inside of the pipes that carry it?,"Mold and algae are actually very good at surviving in water. They can even use the water as a food source. However, they are not able to survive in the water if it is freezing. The pipes that carry the water are typically made of PVC. PVC is a very good material for carrying water. It is very resistant to mold and algae. It is also very resistant to freezing. & #x200B;

Answer:
It's not like they're not cleaning the pipes, it's just that they're not cleaning them as often as you think. The water is filtered in a number of ways before it reaches your house. It's also not like you're drinking water straight from the pipes. It's all treated and purified before you use it. & #x200B;

Answer:
I'm going to be a little bit more technical here, but you can think of it as an analogy. Imagine a big jar of water. You can fill it with water from a faucet, or you can fill it with water from the ocean. If you fill it from the faucet, the water is clean and fresh. If you fill it from the ocean, it's dirty and salty.  ","> drinking water pipes are not regularly flushed out with bleach or something They are, essentially. Drinking water supplies contain a low concentration of chlorine bleach or another disinfectant to prevent germs growing. Also the pipes are sealed, with valves and taps designed to prevent air containing germs being drawn in, and they're opaque so light algae need to grow doesn't get in. EDIT: As many people have mentioned, not all places and countries leave the disinfectant in the water. Ensuring that it's clean when it enters the pipes - either with chemicals that are removed or with UV light - along with the pipes being airtight and dark and unfavourable to life is when done correctly enough to keep the water clean. Public water supplies DO have chemicals added, but for people like me that live in rural areas with private wells, essentially it's just the process of using the water on a regular basis that keeps it fresh. Algea and such come from surface contamination, but well water left in pipes for a few weeks or more may get stagnant or have rust from old steel pipes. Last summer I inadvertantly left my garden hose running all day and ran my well dry. After it finally refilled in a day or two from the surrounding ground water, I had to ""reprime"" the system and let the water run to clear out large contaminants like minerals and rust. The water smelled funny and was brownish for a few days. Even under normal circumstances, I probably ingest small amounts of of microscopic minerals, small celled organisms, rust,etc. Not enough to be harmful, some of the minerals might even be good for me. Remember, humanity has been drinking ""dirty"" water out in nature for most of our existence. To add, modern construction uses copper pipes from the municipal main and throughout the entire house. Copper is self disinfecting, as it's toxic to microbial life. That's not why we use copper, we use it because it's cheap and easy to work with, but it's a convenient consequence. If there were microbes in your plumbing, the surface of the pipes would be a hostile environment for them. As someone who designs municipal water systems, if you have a length of pipe that isn't being used enough and the water sits for more than 48 hours, it is considered stagnant. This is a condition to be avoided. To prevent this, we make sure to connect the water system to itself at many points to increase flow, not use excessive pipe sizes and avoid dead ends in the system. It greatly depends the country you're in. A lot of commenters here mention chlorine as main means of desinfection, combined with copper piping. That certainly is the case in the US and many other countries. In other countries, like the Netherlands where I live, chlorine desinfection isn't common practice. Only 20÷ of households in the Netherlands recieve chlorinated water and in that case chlorine isn't used as a primary desinfectant (as that's not allowed), so the chlorine concentrations are very low. Primary means of desinfection is UV or ozon treatment (at the treatment plant). Growth of biological contaminents in the (mostly PE or PVC) piping is prefented by making sure no contaminents are present in the water before it enters the system, combined with measures to prefent introducing contaminents during transport, such as desinfecting piping with silverperoxide before use and mandatory anti-backflush valves at house connections. Apart from the methods mentioned above, there are many more options that are used around the globe, with fluctuating results; in some countries tap meets drinking water standards, sometimes even of better quality than bottled water (like in the Netherlands), in some countries tap water isn't meant for consumption as drinking water but only for use. While the Dutch take great pride in their drinking water quality, something could also be said for not cleaning the water you use for your washer / dishwasher / shower up to drinking water standards. Plumber here, this is actually a concern for unused pipes, when a house is connected to a municipal water supply it receives treated water. That water treatment includes chlorine which among other things kills bacteria. Water quality varies from house to house and so additional treatment is sometimes necessary to maintain good quality. As long as the water is not stagnant In the pipes the system should be maintained at a satisfactory level. Water quality is a semi complicated subject but that is a very basic explanation. Water Treatment Operator here. In the drinking water plant they add more chlorine to the water than is necessary to deal with any of the bugs that lived in it. This leaves extra floating about ready to deal with any other bugs it might possibly encounter in the pipes under the road or in your own house. On top of that to make sure that there is always water with some of that extra chlorine in it operators will sometimes run taps at the dead ends of the underground pipes. These constantly run water, and make sure that the older water gets pushed out of the dead end pipe by fresher water. Also, operators like me (or people we pay) will routinely go around to fire hydrants and open them up full bore and spray a bunch of water all over the roads or into ditches or whatever. This not only makes sure fresh water gets to all the pipes, it also makes the water run really fast through the pipes and it scours off any bugs, or buildup in which they could live, and spews them out of the hydrants. Quantity Surveyor for a water contractor in the U.K. Here. We operate a service called Trunk Mains Cleaning which basically uses a giant spinning metal brush to clean the insides of large diameter mains. The debris is then flushed out at terminal or inline hydrants. This process will commonly cause small problems later with sand and debris coming out of the supply pipes at customers houses which plumbers then have to flush out for us. When water mains get to old the infrastructure maintenance program that we have uses a method called pipe bursting to replace old ductile iron pipe with new P.E pipe of the same or larger diameter (a machine with a large arrow head smashes through the old pipe while dragging fresh pipe in behind it). Tldr Large mains are cleaned with a big brush, small mains and service pipes are flushed or, if they are to old, burst through and replaced with the same or larger diameter pipe. Those organisms need soluble oxygen and sunlight as an energy source to grow and develop; sealed water mains are considered a zero oxygen environment and does not have any sunlight getting to the water. The water utility I manage does not leave a small amount of chlorine in out distribution system (called precautionary disinfection), we do not chlorinate at all, the water we drink come straight from the ground to our storage tank. We also are required by CalEPA to conduct monthly monitoring of our distribution system for bacterial contamination, positive hits occur rarely.

why do you need to switch on so many things when starting a helicopter?,"The switches are there to ensure that the rotor blades are spinning at the correct speed. This is necessary because the rotor blades need to be spinning at a very precise speed to generate lift. If the rotor blades are spinning too fast, they will overheat. If they are spinning too slow, they will not generate enough lift. The switches ensure that the rotor blades are spinning at the correct speed.","In not only helicopters but most aircraft there are several systems needed in order to sustain flight, such as hydraulic systems, fuel systems, bleed air systems (air supplied by the jet engine providing lift), air conditioning and oxygen, lights, navigation and communication, and electric systems. There could also be multiple systems for redundancy/emergency. All of these switches are turned off to conserve power, make maintenance easier, and prevent accidents. Edit: words I think this has been answered pretty well, but I wanted to draw a comparison to cars to maybe shed more light on it. I fly airplanes, not helicopters, but a lot of the instrumentation and controls are similar. My car has a push-button to start the engine if the radio key is in your pocket. When you push the button, the car's computer negotiates with the key then turns on an electric fuel pump, primes the engine, turns on the starter motor, and enables the ignition system. Once the computer detects that the engine is running, it shuts off the starter motor and turns on the dashboard lights, the radio, and the daytime running lights. While you're driving, the computer monitors a hundred different sensors to make adjustments to fuel/air mixture, ignition timing, and emissions controls, while also monitoring the electrical and charging system. When you want to turn the turn signals, headlights, tail lights, or fog lights on/off, you probably move a single switch which controls all those lights in different combinations. Here's the catch - that computer is a single point of failure for *every single system on the car*. They seem super reliable; lots of people will drive hundreds of thousands of miles without a hiccup from that system. But not everyone - cars occasionally stop communicating with the key, sensors occasionally fail and confuse the system, and electronics occasionally do unexpected things. If you've owned a newer car and gotten recall notices, you'll see a similar trend. For a car, this is a bit of an inconvenience, and you might get stuck in a bad neighborhood or by the side of the road at night. For an airplane or helicopter, this is not an inconvenience, it's a full-on emergency. You can't pull over because the computer flaked out. Aviation is all about separate systems - no matter how confused the battery charging system gets, there's no way for it to affect the ignition system (in fact, airplanes mostly still use an ignition system called a magneto, which was phased out for more efficient, flexible systems in cars by the mid-1930's, because it's fully self-contained - an aircraft engine can run indefinitely with no electricity or outside control or monitoring, as long as you keep giving it fuel). So instead of having a computer overlord turn on all those systems, each one has its own switch for the pilot to operate: 1. Master battery switch - This does make for a single point of failure for the electrical system, but it's not a cheap switch and it still has no control over the engine. 2. Electric fuel pump - This is a secondary pump to supplement the mechanical pump in the engine during critical phases of flight (more redundancy). 5. Priming pump - not a switch, usually a manual pump with a plunger sticking out of the panel. 4. Ignition switch - probably a key in private aircraft, might be a simple switch in military stuff. Selects either or both magnetos to give the pilot control over how the engine is running. 2. Starter motor - hold until the engine is running, then let go. 2. Master avionics switch - Sends power to the flight instruments. 2. Radio switch - Turns on the communication and navigation radios. 6. Strobe light. 5. Navigation lights - wingtips, etc, maybe also instrument panel lights (same idea as car tail lights). 6. Landing light (same idea as headlight). 0. Pitot tube heat - electric heating element to make sure your speedometer keeps working in bad weather. On top of all that, when the pilot is starting they plane they'll probably be changing radio frequencies to get a weather update or flight clearance, and changing settings on the various instruments to suit that flight. And, there are levers to control the fuel/air mixture and a few other things modern cars adjust for themselves. All told, they have to handle more than a dozen controls on the dashboard, because we can't trust a computer to manage all those things reliably enough. And this is on a simple single-engine prop plane; anything with a jet engine, multiple engines, oxygen systems, pressurization, or autopilot typically adds a couple extra switches for those systems.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 49.3, 'recall': 4.44, 'fmeasure': 8.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.14, 'recall': 0.63, 'fmeasure': 1.17}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.99, 'recall': 2.79, 'fmeasure': 5.12}}"

Road tunnels are full of cars that give off toxic fumes, this can prevent build ups. But without knowing specifically what you're talking about that's my best answer. The large turbine-like fans are there to generate air flow through the tunnel. This is so as to prevent the build-up of toxic gasses in the tunnel. These systems are often combined with emergency extraction fans which can be activated in the event of a fire, so as to reduce the chances of death by smoke inhalation. See: URL_0 Heard from engineer in ATL about this once, while sitting in traffic in a tunnel with them -- it has to do some with what was already mentioned, but also with the structural integrity of the tunnels. Heat builds up during static traffic scenarios and compromises tunnel materials. It helps a good bit with the upkeep of tunnel repair. Fires. There have been several bad fires in tunnels where people ended up dying. The huge fans pull out the smoke so trapped drivers don't suffocate. Same reason for side escape tunnels. NFPA 502 code Chapter 11. Just to clarify a bit, the other commenters who have mentioned ventilation are correct, but I'd like to specify that they are indeed fans and not turbines. Fans accelerate air whereas turbines extract work from moving air. They are used to keep the air 'fresh.' They protect from toxic build-up from car exhaust and keep it smelling less. As most people have said its to do with air flow to remove fumes. You'll also see it in basement car parks where natural ventilation isn't possible. It's harder to exchange a volume of stale air/fumes there due to corners as there's not clear path through (ideally air is drawn in near the entrance and out through vents on the other side) so vortex fans are used to direct it/increase flow rate/volume.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 35.44, 'recall': 21.73, 'fmeasure': 26.94}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.83, 'recall': 4.18, 'fmeasure': 5.19}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.42, 'recall': 11.9, 'fmeasure': 14.76}}"

Why do cone filters change the engine's sound?,"Cone filters are a type of speaker. They are made up of a cone shaped membrane that is vibrated by an electrical current. The cone is attached to a coil of wire, which is connected to a magnet. The membrane vibrates back and forth when the electrical current flows through it. The vibrations cause the air around the membrane to vibrate, which creates sound waves. Different shapes of membranes can create different sounds. A cone shaped membrane is one of the most common shapes used in speakers. The sound is changed by the shape of the membrane. The membrane is made of a special material that is designed to resonate at a specific frequency. The material is carefully selected and shaped so that it resonates at the desired frequency. The frequency is determined by the size of the membrane, the shape of the membrane, and the thickness of the membrane. The resonant frequency is determined by the resonant cavity. A resonant cavity is the space inside the cone and the space around the cone. The resonant frequency is the frequency of the sound wave that the cone resonates with. The cone is shaped so that it resonates with the frequency of the engine. This is why the cone filter changes the engine's sound.  ",It changes the factory intake harmonics.

"What are Tesla's ""Battery Farms"" and how do they work?","Tesla has a battery farm in Nevada, which is a collection of battery modules that are used to store electricity. This battery farm is used to power the electric cars that Tesla makes. The battery farm is powered by a combination of solar panels and wind turbines. The solar panels are used to generate electricity during the day, and the wind turbines are used to generate electricity at night. The electricity that is generated is stored in the battery modules and then used to power the electric cars. The battery modules are made of lithium-ion batteries, which are used to store electricity. The lithium-ion batteries are made of a combination of lithium cobalt oxide, graphite, and other materials. The lithium cobalt oxide is used to store the electricity, and the graphite is used to make the batteries more stable. The lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable, which means that they can be used over and over again. Tesla's battery farm in Nevada is used to power the electric cars that are sold in the US, Canada, and Europe. The battery farm is also used to power the electric cars that are sold in other parts of the world, but the electric cars are powered by different battery modules.  ","Australia has a problem. The ways that they generate electricity are fairly constant from moment to moment, but the demand for electricity is not. While they have lots of resources and abilities to generate electricity, demands are far too spiky. Meaning, during the hottest times of the day everyone is turning on their AC. That uses up LOTS of electricity. Most of South Austrians generation is done through wind power and that's a fairly constant generation, even overnight. So while on average demand is meeting supply, there's a problem of timing. Basically, there's lots of electricity at night time, when no one wants it and not enough at noon when everyone needs it. This causes blackouts, and that's bad. The solution here is to store the electricity for use later. Generate it all day and store it in batteries so that they can draw down during the hot times. That is a battery farm. It's really just a very large amount of batteries all in one place. Tesla recently has been building the world's largest battery factory (called the Gigafactory). Batteries, funny enough, are one of the things in this world that we basically can't make enough of. Batteries are in VERY high demand for everything from laptops, and cell phones, to electric cars. So using them for something like this battery factory was previously kind of a nonoption. It simply took so many that it would be too expensive. So electric utilities would look at other solutions like importing electricity from other districts or turning to non-renewable sources that can be easily turned on and off (like a coal plant). Tesla's very large factory has recently started pumping out batteries and that is what's allowing Tesla to do things like sell battery storage products to the home consumer market (the Tesla power wall), sell inexpensive electric cars (like the Model 3) and do battery farm projects like this. They're basically just a really big battery. When you're using fossil fuels to generate power you can just crank up your generator (give it more fuel) to meet demand, but you can't do that with renewable energy. For example, if it's a really hot day and everyone turns on their AC you need more power, but if you're using wind turbines you can't just turn up the wind to meet the demand. With batteries, you can store energy when you're making more power than you need and use it when you're not making enough. Electricity isn't used consistently through the day. Everyone's at work through the middle of the day so there's not much electricity need in the suburbs, but high demand downtown. In the afternoon and evening everyone comes home and does their laundry, turns on their video game consoles and starts cooking dinner, whereas all the offices and factories cool down for the night. Power demand is weird and keeps moving around. Electric generators would like to keep generating a constant amount of power, but the demand is always changing and complex systems are needed to make sure they're balanced. At night there's very little demand, so what do they do with the generators? With coal plants and nuclear plants, generators are actually connected to enormous and [extremely heavy turbines]( URL_0 ) that work by steam pressure. They keep spinning because there's a lot of momentum, and just let the generator spin while disconnected. This is a way of storing extra power generated as *kinetic energy*. It's a problem for Solar Panels and Wind Turbines that they can generate power at whatever time is convenient, but they have no or few heavy parts to use for storing extra power as kinetic energy. So in order to store the extra power generated, we have to build giant batteries. Battery Farms are like much more efficient ways of connecting a whole bunch of car batteries to each other in a warehouse-like building. The batteries are better than the ones you'd find in your car, but the principle is the same. Imagine power is an apple that you want. I only have 2 hands. so you come to me for 1 apple I hand you 1 apple. You and your friend come to me for 1 apple each, I can hand 1 apple to each of you. 1 with my right hand, 1 with my left. You bring a 3rd friends and I can't hand them an apple at the same time because I only have 2 hands. Tesla batteries are like a tray I can place my apples on. I can still only place 1 apple per hand on the tray at a time, but I can just stock pile them on that tray all day long, even when you aren't there asking me for an apple. Then I can just let people grab their own apples when they need them. It's Analogous to water supply. We have enough water in a reservoir but getting it to you when you need it from the reservoir is difficult because you would need to turn a pump on and off depending on when people need it. To solve this instead of turning on and off the pumps we store the water high in the air. The energy to get it to you is ready there so the ability to get water to you is independent from demand fluctuations. Same thing here. They have the energy but getting it to you when you need it is difficult due to timing and demand fluctuations. So they are trying to store energy in batteries as potential so it can be used whenever. Electricity is more difficult that water, because the batteries are more expensive, and you lose energy when you convert electrical to potential. There's lots of correct answers here, but no one has addressed the ""But, why?"" question -- why do we need to store it in the first place? Electricity flows from one place to the next. There's a source and a sink, a producer and a consumer, a plus and a minus. But, electricity does NOT go anyplace if there's no place for it to go and be used. All those windmills turning at night? They're not generating electricity if there's no place for it to go and be used *at that very instant*. Which is WHY we need battery farms in the first place. Now we CAN generate electricity at night, because now it has a place to go -- and here, the water tower analogy is a good one. The concept of a battery farm is that you set up a building, or several filled with the relatively new ""house batteries"" that Tesla has created or their equivalent/better. What this does is it allows you to store power produced at off-peak hours that can be used to supplement the grid at peak hours. This also makes variable power production like wind or solar more viable for primary power production as you can store power from the day for nigh or cloudy days, or can store power from windy days for calm ones. Building these is also a way to help increase the distance you can transmit power as you can put them at the drop off points and store up a larger charge for the next leg of transmission. This would not be extremely efficient, but it is better than not being able to transmit the long distance at all and could theoretically mean that you need fewer power plants. This means you could in theory build a lot of solar plants in say a desert and supply people far away from said desert. To put it simply, think of it like an external battery/powerpack that you can buy to charge your phone. On an average day, you don't need it. But let's just say, you're on a long flight and want to play games on your phone to pass time. You know your phone wont make it through so you use your power pack to charge it back up. Battery farms work the same way. Your consistent use is met by the usual power sources, but when there are spikes in demand, you can use the battery farm to supplement the higher load. And this battery farm can be charged by your usual power sources when there is surplus load (night time, cooler days etc) or by renewable sources (sun, wind etc.) so that they're charged and can be used as needed. Follow up question, to my understanding all of these large battery packs are built upon the humble 18650 cell; why? Is there a size constraint to battery cells that prevents the building of larger cells? Do they become less efficient or increasingly expensive when you build a cell larger than a few inches? Batteries? A reservoir would be the first though surely? Lots of batteries? Ever see The Matrix when Neo unplugs and flushes himself? It's not like that at all! They are a bunch of batteries that store electricity. Usually electricity from things like solar or wind. Solar and wind energy isn't created on demand. Its created when its created. So you store it in a battery farm. The battery farm then provides energy on demand, like when you turn on your air conditioner or clothes washer. Works like a capacitor in electronics: smooths out the flow of electricity(voltage in the case of capacitors). They are giant batteries because ""renewable"" sources are not consistent (the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow) so you need the giant batteries to store the electricity for the times when the sources aren't producing electricity. The problem with them is it makes ""renewable energy"" not renewable because the battery farms are lithium ion batteries and lithium is not renewable and mining it is just as bad if not worse for the environment than fracking.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 76.67, 'recall': 9.52, 'fmeasure': 16.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 30.14, 'recall': 3.73, 'fmeasure': 6.63}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 46.19, 'recall': 5.73, 'fmeasure': 10.2}}"
Why does a phone charge faster when the data is switched off?,"A phone's charging port is a USB port, and USB is a standardized connection. USB 2.0 is the most common, and it's capable of transferring 480 Mbps (megabits per second) of data. USB 3.0 is the most common modern standard, and it's capable of transferring 5 Gbps (gigabits per second) of data. USB 3.1 is the latest standard, and it's capable of transferring 10 Gbps of data. USB 3.2 is the next standard, and it's capable of transferring 20 Gbps of data. USB-C is the latest standard, and it's capable of transferring 100 Gbps of data. USB-C is the same as USB 3.1, but it's capable of transferring 100 Gbps of data. USB-C is a more efficient standard than USB 3.1, and it's the new standard.

","Imagine a jug of water with a valve at the bottom that can let water out. If you fill up the jug while the valve is open full blast it will fill very slowly, as water is draining out of the bottom at the same time; if you fill up the jug while the valve is almost closed it will fill much faster as the water is draining out much more slowly. Your phone charge follows a similar concept. If you have all of the radios on, the phone is using a good deal of power even while it is charging - this is similar to the jug valve being open full blast.

What prevents Tesla cars that are powered by lithium ion from exploding in a traffic wreck?,"Lithium ion batteries are a type of battery called a secondary cell. Unlike primary cells, which are designed to be used once and then discarded, secondary cells are designed to be rechargeable. Secondary cells are made up of two electrodes, a cathode and an anode, separated by an electrolyte. The electrodes are usually made of a metal oxide, and the electrolyte is usually a liquid solvent. Lithium ion batteries are a specific type of secondary cell, which is called a lithium-ion battery. The electrodes in a lithium-ion battery are made of a metal oxide, usually lithium cobalt oxide. The electrolyte is usually a solvent, such as a mixture of ethylene carbonate and a lithium salt, and it is stored in a sealed container. Lithium ion batteries are relatively safe, but they do have some risks. They can catch fire if they are punctured, and they can also catch fire if they are exposed to high temperatures. In a traffic wreck, the battery would be exposed to a high temperature, and it could catch fire. However, the battery is designed to be safe. Lithium ion batteries are made of a metal oxide, and they are surrounded by a plastic casing.  ","The battery is protected by an armor plate made from aluminum and/or titanium (depending on model) and divided into separate compartments. This provides decent protection against damage to the battery that could cause it to catch fire. Battery fire is still a risk, but remember that you aren't comparing it to no risk at all, you're comparing it to a risk of fire from a spilled tank of gas, and compared to that it really isn't bad at all. Also, the batteries are made up of thousands of small lithium ion cells, so in the event of a crash a crash, a few of the small cells might explode as opposed to one or two big cells being ruptured The entire pack is liquid cooled, and is designed for a controlled burn in case of fire. A few Teslas have caught fire since their inception, including ones in very high speed collisions and none have exploded outright. The packs tend to burn hot, and are difficult to put out in their own right. But do have the advantage of not *leaking a flammable liquid that floats on water*. Something I don't worry about driving around in my vehicle filled with a hundred litres of explosive liquid. We're pretty normalised to that now. Lithium battery fire doesn't seem that bad by comparison. They're both a pretty deadly compromise to make for the convenience of personal transport.

How was it possible for electric cars to exist 100 years ago when the technology only recently became mature enough to become practical?,"/u/SirRigel64's answer is a good one, but I'd like to add a few more things. Electric cars did exist in the early 1900s. In fact, there were more electric cars than gasoline cars in the 1900s. The reason for this is that the electric car was more practical than the gasoline car. Electric cars were quieter, faster, and more reliable than gasoline cars. They were also easier to maintain and cheaper to operate. But they were not as powerful. So, people who needed to travel long distances would use a gasoline car, and then switch to an electric car when they got to their destination.  . There were many electric trucks in the 1900s, but they were not very common in the 1920s because the gasoline car had become more practical and popular. Electric cars were still used in cities, where the gasoline car was not practical. The electric car was more practical than the gasoline car because it was quieter, faster, and more reliable. Electric cars were also cheaper to operate and maintain. But they were not as powerful. So, people who needed to travel long distances would use a gasoline car, and then switch to an electric car when they got to their destination.  ","125-150 years ago cars were a relatively new technology, and it wasn't at all clear that gasoline-powered internal combustion engines were the way to go. Back then the differences between the two were not as extreme. In particular, it was the introduction of mass production by Henry Ford in 1908 with the Ford Model T (which used a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine) that heavily contributed to tipping the scales in favor of gas-powered cars. So gasoline-powered internal combustion ""won."" As cars powered by internal combustion engines became cheaper to produce and thus more readily available, investment in furthering the technology of electric-powered vehicles decreased. That said, it's really kind of unfair to characterize electric cars as ""finally"" able to compete with gas cars. Gasoline powered internal-combustion received hundreds of billions of dollars in investment over the last 100 years; electric cars didn't. It wasn't until the gasoline shortages of the 70's and 80's that the industry started thinking about investing in electric vehicle technology again. If both technologies had received equivalent R & D over the last century, electric vehicles would have been competitive long ago. But that's not how technological progress occurs. In the early stages of development of a new technology, there are typically a number of competing options, but eventually an industry gravitates to a smaller number of options -- or even one option -- because of some particular advantages (typically cheaper to produce). Then the lion's share of investment gets committed to _that_ option, and it progresses faster than the other options, cementing it's lead. Eventually, though, as alternative technologies continue to slowly develop or faults in the ""winning"" technology become apparent in the long-term (e.g. with cars, fossil fuels' impact on the climate), another option that in the past might have been more expensive to produce or less efficient or whatever, starts to become cheaper or more efficient and can re-emerge. Partially, this is what's happening with electric vehicles. tl;dr -- If Henry Ford had gone with an electric engine instead of a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine, the history of transportation would have been different. Electric cars of the 1880s were very fragile things with very short range and heavy (for the time) batteries, just like electric cars of 1980s and 1990s. But back in those days, competing petrol cars were no good either. They were a nightmare to maintain, hard to start, hard to drive (controls were nothing like today's cars) and you needed good mechanic skills to drive them. Electric cars, in comparison, were only a little slower but much easier to start, stop, maintain and repair. They were often preferred by women drivers and those who didn't want/afford to hire a driver. The big difference now is new kinds of batteries. Interestingly, when the car was a new idea, running one on steam or electricity was as valid as petrol. In cities, electric may have seemed preferable. The big disadvantage was basically how far the car could go on the batteries it carried. In them says I guess it would have been simple lead acid? New Lithium Iron batteries get you much better range for their weight. If you are ever in stuttgart, you can see one of the first Porsche cars at the museum and that's electric.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 62.5, 'recall': 22.89, 'fmeasure': 33.51}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.46, 'recall': 5.64, 'fmeasure': 8.27}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.48, 'recall': 9.33, 'fmeasure': 13.66}}"
The differences between the types of welding and their uses.,"Lets say you're a blacksmith. You want to make a sword. You can't just take a piece of metal and weld it together. You have to forge it. You take the metal, heat it up, hammer it, and shape it. Then you take it back to the forge and heat it up again. You hammer it again and shape it. This is called the ""pre-heat"" and ""post-heat"". You can do this over and over again. It's called ""annealing"". This is done to make the metal stronger. The metal will become stronger as it heats up and cools down. Now you want to weld the sword together. You take the two pieces of metal and weld them together. But you can't just use a welder. You need to use a ""torch"". A torch is a device that uses a flame to weld things together. You have to hold the torch at the end of the sword and weld the two pieces together. The torch is heating up the metal. Then you take the torch and move it along the sword. This is called ""traveling"". You have to move the torch along the sword to make sure the metal is heated up and melted. Then you have to cool it down. This is called ""cooling"".  ","This is not something easily answered here. The real answer would fill a book. There are many techniques depending on what and where you are welding and what the weld needs to accomplish. The most common techniques for metals are spot, stick and TIG and MIG wire feed. There are also weld techniques for other materials such as plastics. At its heart it is using melted material to bond solid material. I'm no expert at welding but I do know a few things - Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), basically stick welding, is typically used by home-gamers to make repairs on equipment because of the ease and simplicity of use. It can be used to weld in windy weather since the rod is covered in a layer of flux, but it creates a lot of slag that has to be chipped off of the weld. Pipeline welders typically use an upscaled version of this setup. - Metal inert gas (MIG) is a type of wire welder that uses a gas, such as CO2 or argon, to shield the arc from the atmosphere. It makes pretty and clean welds with no slag, but it cannot be used where the gas can be blown away from the weld. Shop use only. - Torch welding is the oldest of all, it isn't typically used anymore because it's kind of difficult to use and very dangerous. You have to not only hold a torch and separate rod to fill with, but you also have to set up the acetylene and oxygen properly. It's mostly used to patch holes in liquid holding containers nowadays. - Tungsten inert gas (TIG) is like the second iteration of torch welding. It combines the principles of torch and MIG welding to create beautiful and structurally sound welds with no slag. But again it cannot be used where the gas can be blown away from the weld. There are more ways to weld than just these but it can really fill a book. You can't exactly have a system that works in all situations so that necessitates having multiple methods.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 49.77, 'recall': 30.97, 'fmeasure': 38.18}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.17, 'recall': 5.7, 'fmeasure': 7.03}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.29, 'recall': 14.49, 'fmeasure': 17.86}}"
"When writing a really big piece of software, how do the large numbers of programmers involved make sure they don't break everybody else's bits of code every time they change something in their little bit?"," Sometime ago, I was working on a large software project with a lot of developers. It was a big project, so big that it had its own wiki and documentation. One day, I was working on a feature that required me to change a lot of code. I had to change the code of about 10 different functions and 5 different classes. I worked on it for about 3 hours. When I finished, I committed the changes to the repository. But I realized that I had forgotten to add a new function to the documentation. So, I went back to the repository, made the changes, committed them, and then went back to work. I did this about 10 times. It was a lot of work, but   excited because I was making progress. I was happy with what I was doing, and I felt like   making a difference. But then, my coworker told me that he had to fix something I had done. He told me that the code I had written was broken.   surprised. I had been working on the code for a while, and I thought that I had been careful. I was confused and I didn't know what to do. I asked him why, and he told me that I had written something that was not correct. He told me that he had to fix it.   upset. I didn't know what to do.  ","Large-team software stuff sucks unless you have a strong leader delegating well-communicated and specific tasks. In software, abstraction is important. In other words, for two parts of a program to work together, they just have to know how to talk to each other - they *don't* have to know how the other part actually works internally. In other words, the two parts have to know how to ""interface"" with each other. Imagine I had a method/function called 'add' that would accept two numbers and add them together. To call the function, id say add(3, 5) and the result would be 8. I have no clue how it adds those two numbers, and quite frankly I don't really care as long as it works. So if I create the basic (theoretical) design of the software, I can design all of the interfaces (the function names, the parameters and their types, and what type of item the function returns as a result) and hand out chunks of the program for people to code. If you write my add() function, you can make it work internally however you want as long as you follow the requirements I gave you (that it accepts two integers, and returns the sum of the two integers). And that way I can assign Tim another part of the code that will constantly use your add() function. He will write his code assuming that your add() function will work. Then, everyone puts the code together and tests it. It won't work because that's how life goes. Fix the errors one by one with tons of testing in between. Of course, this is definitely overly simplified, but hopefully it gives you a small hint. The other important part is extreme communication and frequent meetings. Incremental deadlines are helpful, but are hardly met. Lastly, it's good to have a leader supervise everyone else. Every studio does something different from each other, and so it seems most answers will be slightly different from each other. In general, the most important thing to know is that things will and do get broken. Ideally, those things are then fixed before it impacts others much. I will step through each individual piece that's gone through for at least where I work (which is specifically with Video Games). This will likely be a very very long post, so I'll try to simplify each piece down for the ELI5: > **The Main Steps** 1. **Space.** Room to work in. When there's a lot of code to work with, it's much easier for programmers to work on parts of the code where other programmers aren't touching it as often. If you think of programmers in a large house both building the house and building things in the house, the larger the house is then the easier it is to have a couple rooms to yourself or a small group of people. 2. **Isolation.** Rooms try to stay mostly to themselves. You don't want to have your ceiling staying up because you put a log wedged into the cabinet in the next room. Especially if programmers work only on a single room at a time, they might not realize the random log in *their* room is important and that they shouldn't move the cabinet. It's better to build supports in your room for your ceiling. 3. **Modularity.** You don't always know what the rooms next to your room might be, or if they might need to be replaced. So code makes things modular to deal with this, saying ""there are 3 doors. They are these sizes and at these locations"". Where those doors go to can change. 4. **Compiler** (this one will be more specific and definitely not shared by all codebases). Strangely, this massive house everyone is working on only _describes_ the house. Which is why modularity (3) or isolation (2) is so important. You can't always easily see what your room will actually touch until the whole house comes together. There's this thing called a compiler that actually takes all the descriptions of room and builds a house out of it. The compiler will complain when things don't quite connect where they should, or where the modularity says something is wrong, because the compiler can't finish it's job. (Jargon note: There are actually a few pieces in this - such as the linker or preprocessor - and the compiler is just one of these pieces. Programmers a lot of times just group them all together to save time when talking.) 5. **Unit tests.** There's a lot of pieces that require very very specific things that it must do. To keep running with our house analogy, this may be to say that a specific breaker switch controls the electricity to only a few specific rooms in the house. Or that a faucet always gives the same heat when turned on to the same angle each time. In code, this is usually complicated functions that bare most of this wait. Instead of having to check all of these things that are easy to miss, unit tests are made that checks these things for you. They're just more code that you say ""I expect this to always do these things when this happens to it. Check that for me every time I use the compiler."" And they do. Thank you unit tests. In my experience though, unit tests can't cover even a tiny bit of the range of inputs a video game has possible, so in our case these aren't good enough. 6. **Personal Check.** After the compiler puts everything together, each programmer can walk through the house themself and just check if everything seems to be in place, and then specifically check out the room they were working on and see if it's hooked up correctly for themselves. A lot of times, programmers will make their own tools to let them cheat around their room to make this type of check faster. For games, let's say you're working on a new way to purchase items, you might give yourself a tool that let's you freely make money. That kind of thing. (There's more code to prevent these tools from going out to everyone) 7. **Functional Tests.** Unit tests (5) like to check very small pieces, but a large part of the house can be checked all at once with something called functional tests. Functional tests look at how something should work in general, rather the specifics. In our house, they could ensure things like... starting from the front door, can you still eventually make it into the attic? This helps for cases where someone might remove a door somewhere, for their own good reasons, but fail to see the big picture somewhere else. These also occur automatically, but in our code base it's usually after the programmer has committed the code - so that the programmer doesn't have to wait on these tests (they can take awhile). 8. **QA - Quality Assurance.** There's a large group of people who are really good are doing all these different types of checks themselves as well, predicting what types of changes might break what, or even being very clever at breaking the code in ways nobody else thought to try. These are QA. Tests (like unit tests and functional tests) are only as good as a programmer can predict the program might work, but breaking something can be more extensive a job than what the programmer might consider. In those cases, QA is specialized in finding out where other problems might lie. 9. **Build Pipeline.** Hinted with the fuctional tests bit, there's computers specially setup to do the compiler (4), unit tests (5), and functional tests (7) all on their own. A lot of people can be changing a large part of the house at once and need to have their changes all at similar times. This can create times where personal checks and running your own compiler doesn't catch problems that might arise from two different changes not liking each other. Build machines do the steps above with everyone's code (who put their code in) to provide their own versions of the checks. a. **Build Pipeline - Multiple Operating Systems.** This is a special note for game dev. Operating systems, like Windows XP, Windows 7, OSX 10.6, etc. can all be quite different from each other. Thing of these like broad locations your house can be built on, with the more different the operating system the more different the location. If you're constantly checking if your house might work in a forest, there might not be something you noticed when your house is on a tall barren mountain. Or underwater. Operating systems get very different. The ""big ones"" should be checked yourself, but build machines and QA (Compatability) can help to fill in the gaps. 10. **CI - Continuous Integration.** (Blah that term sounds technical). CI is something of a philosophy that some studios have and a way of setting up the build pipeline (9). CI is the idea that, two sets of eyes is better than one set, and this can only get better from there. When you put code in the shared place so that a build pipeline can use it, it's *possible* that can be one of many places with many different build pipelines. Historically, this is how a lot of code bases worked, you would have teams with their own build pipelines who would then eventually do a large push of all of the changes they did in the last few months (or years) from their builds to the big central build. This was called ""integration"". CI just says ""Hey everyone, just put all your stuff in the central spot and figure out some other way to hide it."". This means that while everyone is walking through their spots in the house, they might be more likely to see other problems for someone else more often. More eyes. 11. **Playtests.** (Game dev specific, kinnnnd of. Just called different things elsewhere.) If you're building a fun house, play in that fun house to make sure it's actually fun and working the way it should be - and that no random spike it sticking out under a trampoline. It's better for you to get hurt than your players. Game programmers make sure to play where they build. 12. **Large Testing Environments.** Beta testing. Similar to CI (10)'s mentality of ""the more eyes, the better"", programmers try to get lots of different potential home owners to try out their house for awhile just to get more eyes. And, more importantly, more environments - locations - where the house could be. Again, this provides more opportunity for something bad to occur and for someone to see it and report it. you do it by modularizing your code. your own module takes X input and makes Y output. you can have an automated test that provides various X inputs and validates Y output. run it thru 100's and 1000's of different X's and make sure it comes out to the correct Y's. then your module plugs into my module. my module takes A's inputs and makes B outputs. in order to do so, it takes the A's and uses some parts of it as X to call your module. and when it gets back the Y, my module does something to it and makes a B output. another set of tests run thousands of A inputs and validates that output is correct B. whenever the next time you change your module, we'll rerun all the 1000 tests for your module as well as my module. Just to add a note about Version Control Software. I anticipate I'm not native English so bear with my bad explanation lol. We use this type of software which allows teams to cooperate on the same project files while tracking changes and stuff. When merging your changes with other's (ie ""propagating"" them to the rest of the team) if multiple people have changed the same portion of code you'll get a merge conflict, and you'll know that for example someone did not respect that distribution of tasks. Again, sorry it sounds a ""childish"" explanation It's been said multiple times, but software is built in modules that have contracts. ""I accept this, and I give that back."" You can change anything so long as the contract remains unchanged. If you change the contract you (potentially) need to update everything that uses that contract. When ordering a pizza you don't need to worry that you might not know how anymore because they changed how their ovens work. So long as the contract remains the same you don't need to relearn how to order a pizza. If they changed the contract, like for example, no longer accepting cash, then you would need to make changes yourself. Code needs to be written in understandable components or it gets very messy very fast. I've worked with code like that and it takes ten times the brain power and time to get anything done. When code is broken down into manageable pieces with a single purpose it's beautiful. It doesn't matter how big the total software is if it's just a bunch of tiny parts. When working on something you should only need to know how that one tiny part has to work. It's as if the software only consists of that tiny part. In we'll run projects they use tests to ensure this. They write test code that validates the way the program works. That way if something changes they can rerun the test suite and see if there is anything amiss. This helps a lot but it isn't perfect. There is still human quality assurance that happens to catch unintended things. Even this isn't perfect, and that's how you get bugs in your program.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 66.67, 'recall': 6.67, 'fmeasure': 12.12}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.1, 'recall': 1.6, 'fmeasure': 2.92}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 35.86, 'recall': 3.59, 'fmeasure': 6.52}}"

There are a bunch of different equations regarding capacitors and how they respond, but suffice to say that the capacitor charges until it is unable to charge anymore and then the current continues out of the capacitor (because it can't hold anymore, picture a you pouring water into a glass and once the glass is full the water overflows and reaches the table) and onto point B telling the phone to turn on. Now, you may ask, why then when i hold the button for 1 second x 3 it doesn't turn on, but when i hold it once for 3 seconds it does...doesn't the capacitor still get charged? Well the answer is yes, but when you stop charging the capacitor it starts spending its saved energy, but at a lower current level than is what is necessary to activate point B","{'rouge1': {'precision': 52.11, 'recall': 13.7, 'fmeasure': 21.7}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.71, 'recall': 1.49, 'fmeasure': 2.36}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.99, 'recall': 8.15, 'fmeasure': 12.9}}"

How do different shapes of glasses affect the alcoholic beverage taste?,"It's all about the surface area. When you drink a beer, you are tasting the beer and the yeast. The yeast is in the air, the beer is in the glass, and you are in the glass. If you were in a glass with a small opening, you would taste mostly the air and the yeast. If you were in a glass with a large opening, you would taste mostly the beer. If you were in a glass with a large opening and the opening was in the shape of a cone, you would taste mostly the beer and the yeast. If you were in a glass with a large opening and the opening was in the shape of a sphere, you would taste mostly the air and the yeast. The shape of the glass affects how much of the yeast is in the air, and how much of the beer is in the glass.","Tulip Shape: Bulb that tapers in before flaring out at the top. Purported Benefits: concentration of aroma, support of the foamy head at the top, and comfortable drinking afforded by flared rim. Chalice Shape: A round bowl on a stem. Purported Benefits: Beautiful presentation, foam support, wide mouth for easy drinkin' (in big sips.) Pilsner Shape: Tall, footed, slender, tapered out from the bottom. Purported Benefits: Displays the beer's clarity, while tapered shape supports head. Weizen Shape: Tall, large, slender at bottom, bowled out a bit at the top. Purported Benefits: Large size accommodates a massive, frothy head associated with highly-carbonated German wheat beers. Slender bottom shows off these beers' famous hazy color and protects its lively carbonation. Nonick Imperial Pint Shape: Large, slightly tapered out with bulge near top. Purported benefits: Designed for the no-nonsense drinker. The bulge facilitates stacking and prevents rim chipping. Shaker Pint Shape: Slight taper outward from bottom. Purported benefits: Cheap and easily stackable. Sturdy ones can be used for stirring and shaking cocktails. Snifter Shape: Stemmed, wide-bowled, tapered in at top. Purported benefits: Designed for maximum concentration of volatile organic compounds—that is, aroma. Tumbler Shape: Short and squat with thick glass and a slight outward taper. Purported Benefits: Tradition generally drives the use of this glass, which is usually reserved for Belgian witbier and lambic. The shape of the glass affects how your mouth and nose (eyes to an extent) interact with the beverage. A very wide glass will allow your whole nose to enter the glass as you sip it, the aroma adds to and complements the taste. A very narrow glass like a champagne flute reduces surface area which keeps the bubbly bubbles from gassing out before you can drink it. Other glasses like a Brandy snifter allow to you swirl the beverage without spilling it, the swirling allows the aroma to release but the narrow lip of the glass traps most of it in the glass, so you can get your nose right in there. Some glasses have stems to keep your body heat out of the beverages while other glasses encourage the handling to warm the drink inside. Certain beer glasses have wider tops which allows the head to form and remain which contributes to aroma and protects the beer below from reacting with the oxygen in the air. Beer stiens have a handle so the beer stays cold. There's are many more examples but this covers some basic reasons for shapes. As an experiment try your favourite drink in various glasses and see if you notice the subtle effects. I'm not sure how it works, but if you pour root beer into a square glass it turns into regular beer. I took a wine class in college and a sommelier came as a guest speaker and his answer to this question was: You're favorite wine will taste best in your favorite type of glass. That there was no right or wrong, suggesting how wine as a whole is just the experience you make it. All ""science"" and snooty sommelier-ness aside. I thought it was pretty cool. Until a better answer comes along: Some glassware has different openings, exposing the beverage to more or less air. Taste is related to smell, so a glass that has room for your nose will allow you to 'experience' more of the drink. In beer glasses, some shapes allow for more foam (or head), and that is often part of the taste of the beer (like Guinness or Boddingtons). Different shapes also have different surface areas. Red wine glasses have more surface area because the wine is meant to be tasted at room temp, white wine has less surface area to help keep the wine chilled. Glassware that has stems (like wine and martini) is so the temperature of your hand doesn't change the temp of the drink. The answer is actually quite simple. They don't. The reason as to why we do it can be explained by [this video]( URL_0 ) 90% of the mythology is hype, put out by glassmakers to sell more glasses to people who already have too many. I use a plain stemmed Bordeaux wineglass, big enough for me to get my nose into, for whatever wine I'm drinking, or even for beer. I just don't want a 'stemless' glass, where the heat of my hand warms the wine, and the glass gets greasy from food if any finger food is involved. And I don't want a deep curve in the glass, where I have to crack my neck backwards trying to get the last drop. OP, you may be interested in the beer glass that Samuel Adams designed. The shape is to help give it a nice head, while it's thicker around the middle do your hand doesn't warm the beer. At the lip of it there is a small ridge that's supposed to tumble the beer as it enters your mouth, ""activating"" it's flavor. What I think is coolest though, is the laser etched imperfections in the bottom of the glass that cause the bubbles to rise and aerate the beer. The imperfections are in a perfect circle at the bottom middle of the glass. The mouth of the glass and size effects aromatics of the drink creating a more pleasurable flavour when consumed. Size of glass for mixed drinks effects the volume left in the drink to tone down the desired alcohol. The shape of the glass affects where and when the liquid hits your tongue, and so what flavors you'll notice first. Since no one inhales as the sip whether your nose is in there too makes no difference. Every wine benefits from swirling to release aromatics, so under fill your glasses. But don't take my word for it! Gather some friends, and some glasses, and give them a blind tasting of the same wine in a few different glasses. Even better if you can do the same three glasses with two different wines.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 80.13, 'recall': 12.27, 'fmeasure': 21.28}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 25.16, 'recall': 3.83, 'fmeasure': 6.65}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 47.44, 'recall': 7.26, 'fmeasure': 12.6}}"

Why did they make Method-1's hips so narrow if they wanted to make the mech's gait more stable?,The hip joint is a ball and socket joint. The ball is the femur and the socket is the pelvis. The femur is a long bone that runs from the knee to the hip. The pelvis is made up of four bones that fuse together to form a single structure. The pelvis is the base of the spine and the hip joint is the base of the femur. The hip joint is designed to be stable. The femur is a long bone and the pelvis is a heavy bone. The femur needs to be able to rotate around the pelvis to move the leg forward. The pelvis is heavy and the femur is long.

If we didn't, we would tip over in the direction of the lifted leg. Similarly, for Method-1, if they made the hips wider then the legs would be further apart, which means that every time they walk forward the whole machine has to lean over much further, which is wasted energy and probably makes it more unbalanced on a single foot, because of that brief period during the lean where the center of mass is to the side of the part touching the ground.

Why/how do stone buildings burn down or get damaged by fire?,"Stone buildings can burn down or get damaged by fire. Fire can be caused by a variety of factors including sparks from machinery, lightning, a lit cigarette, etc. However, stone is not a flammable material and is not designed to burn. It is a hard, solid rock made up of minerals and so it cannot burn. It is true that some stone buildings have been destroyed by fire. The most famous example is the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey. This was a church built in the 6th century AD and was converted into a mosque in the 15th century. In 1850 it was converted into a museum and was the largest museum in the Ottoman Empire. It was a beautiful, ornate building made of marble and mosaics. In 1908 a fire broke out in the museum and it was largely destroyed. The fire was caused by a lightning strike. It is possible that the fire was caused by a spark from a nearby train. The Hagia Sophia was rebuilt and it is now a museum again. The fire that destroyed the Hagia Sophia was a major disaster and it is thought that the building was not as well equipped to handle a fire as modern buildings are.  ","Typically the stone itself does not burn. What happens is everything else burns (furniture, paint, wood, etc) and creates such heat that the stones expands and crack. This then causes the building to collapse at which point bricks and stone are crushed into a powder similar to ash. The stone itself might not burn, but depending on the type of stone, and the intensity of the fire, the stone may crack. That might be sufficient enough damage to cause the structure to collapse. Or maybe weaken enough that people abandon it, and over time it collapses. Remember stone structures have combustible materials inside, wooden stuff, tapestry, textiles, candles and candle wax spills, soot buildup, etc. Finally the stone structure may be held in place by mortar, the heat of the fire might damage the mortar and cause it fail which weakens the joints between the stones. In addition to what people here have already said, often the supports for floors and the roof are wood. If those burn and collapse, especially if they do so asymmetrically the beams can lever portion of the walls down and even if they don't you're left with a shell that has few no no internal supports and is heavily weakened.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 29.47, 'recall': 29.33, 'fmeasure': 29.4}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.4, 'recall': 3.38, 'fmeasure': 3.39}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.46, 'recall': 15.38, 'fmeasure': 15.42}}"

"Why aren't washer/dryers (one machine, two uses) more mainstream?","They are more common in Europe. There are a lot of reasons why they aren't more popular in the US.

Another reason is that there are fewer people living in apartments or houses that are close enough to a laundromat. Also, a lot of people like the convenience of having their own machines at home.","1.

"What happens if I were to connect a NAND gate to one of it's inputs, then power the other input? Would it make some sort of clock cycle?","It's not a clock, but it's actually a very simple form of a flip flop. A flip flop is a circuit that has two inputs, two outputs, and a clock input. If the clock is high, the output will be the same as the input. If the clock is low, the output will be the opposite of the input. So in your case, if you connected the NAND gate to one of its inputs, and then powered the other input, the output would change randomly, but the output would also be the opposite of the input. In other words, if the input is 0, the output will be 1, and if the input is 1, the output will be 0.","Electrical Engineer here. TL;DR, no. It'll reach some steady state where the output voltage equals the input voltage, but it doesn't represent a 1 or a 0. If you want it to oscillate, you need to chain multiple inverters (your 1-input NAND gate). This is called a ring oscillator, and it works because the delay across multiple inverters prevents any of them from reaching the steady state. NAND gates (and really any electronic device) are ultimately analog components. This is important because the way devices behave are dependent on the voltage of the inputs, and not all voltages translate to a logic value. Let's simplify your scenario a little. Think of an inverter (1- > 0, 0- > 1). In reality, logic 1 is really some voltage, call it 5V, and logic zero is another voltage, 0V (generally a little higher than ground, but it doesn't matter). You can think of the inverter as a device that maps 5V- > 0V, and 0V- > 5V. What about a voltage somewhere in the middle of 5V and 0V? Picture a graph, the x-axis is the input voltage, and the y-axis is the output voltage. You know you have two points, (0, 5) and (5, 0). Now draw a line that connects them. That line represents the inverter (or at least a linear model of one). Vout = 5V - Vin. This is a little simplified, but you'll get the picture. Now, think about what happens as the output swings. Say I start at 5V. The inverter will start to move towards 0V. But this changes the input. Let's say we're now at 4V, the output will want to go to 1V. Now we're at 3V. The output wants to be at 2V. At 2.5V, the output wants to be at 2.5V. The inverter is stuck! The input voltage maps exactly to itself. You might get a little oscillation because there is a delay between the input and output, but each time around it will get closer to 2.5V, and eventually it'll reach a steady state. Now, if you chain multiple inverters, the delay from the output of an inverter, through all the others, and back into its own input will be large, and the inverter can get to the desired voltage output before the input changes. This is what we call a ring oscillator. Each inverter adds a little delay, and if the chain around takes longer than the time it takes for the inverters to swing their output, you'll get permanent oscillations, otherwise it'll die off eventually.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 68.03, 'recall': 18.91, 'fmeasure': 29.59}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.01, 'recall': 5.25, 'fmeasure': 8.23}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 38.52, 'recall': 10.71, 'fmeasure': 16.76}}"
Why do blinkers make the blinking noise?,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""blinkers"" but the reason that your eyes make a sound when you blink is because the muscles that control the eyelids are connected to the muscles that control the eyeballs. When you blink, the muscles that control the eyelids are contracting. When the muscles that control the eyelids contract, they also pull on the muscles that control the eyeballs. When the muscles that control the eyeballs are pulled, they make a sound. I'm not sure why this happens, but it's probably because the muscles that control the eyeballs are very close to the muscles that control the eyelids.","Originally, blinkers were driven by relays. Relays are electromechanical switches where a magnet is powered on to physically connect two pieces of metal - and they 'click' when they're actuated. In the modern day, it's more likely that your blinkers use solid state electronics with an artificial 'click' to match people's expectations. There is usually a clicker of some sorts under the dash... whether electric(usually within a relay) or mechanical. It's only purpose is to remind you that your turn signal is on. Actually, the [mechanism of a blinker]( URL_0 ) consists of a bent piece of metal that gets hot when current passes through it (to light up the signal lights); the metal dilates because of the heat, and thus moves away from the contact and interrupts the circuit to the lights. Without the current, the metal then gets cold and moves back into the initial contact position. Basically, it's a switch that uses the fact that electricity produces heat, and heat can make a metal change its shape/size. So that's how the clicking happens, that piece of metal clicking in and out of contact. That's also why the signal lights on (some) cars blink faster when one of the signal bulbs is burned out (the remaining signal light bulb has a different electrical resistance than 2 bulbs).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 45.37, 'recall': 21.59, 'fmeasure': 29.25}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.74, 'recall': 1.77, 'fmeasure': 2.4}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.85, 'recall': 12.78, 'fmeasure': 17.31}}"

When the crankshaft turns the camshaft moves and opens and closes the valve. The valve is connected to a fuel injector and exhaust port. When the valve opens the fuel injector sprays fuel into the cylinder and the exhaust port opens and the fuel/air mixture is expelled. The engine has 4-6 cylinders and each cylinder has a valve. The engine can have 2-4 valves per cylinder. The engine also has a timing belt. The timing belt is connected to the crankshaft and camshaft. The timing belt synchronizes the movement of the crankshaft and camshaft. The engine also has a distributor. The distributor is connected to the timing belt and is used to distribute the spark to the spark plugs. The spark plugs are connected to the cylinder and ignite the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder. The engine also has a radiator.  ,"The voltage rating of the charger is the amount that the charger will put out, regardless of what you attach to it. However current (amps) is drawn by the device. So the current rating on the charger is the max amount that it *can* provide. The device only takes as much as it wants. So if a charger says 5 Volts and 2 Amps, then it will put out 5 volts and the device can draw anywhere from 0 to 2 amps. You can think about voltage and current like water in pipes. The voltage represents the water pressure pushing it forward and the current represents, well, the water's current or flow rate. Now, you can have water moving as fast as you want through those pipes, but when too much pressure builds up the pipe will burst. (This is why we can't run transmission line's at infinitely high voltages. They will arc and give off corona discharge, ionizing the air around them, or they will ionize and fry the insulation.)","{'rouge1': {'precision': 20.74, 'recall': 22.41, 'fmeasure': 21.55}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.14, 'recall': 2.31, 'fmeasure': 2.22}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.96, 'recall': 17.24, 'fmeasure': 16.57}}"
"how hairdryers manage to heat up to full temperature almost immediately, yet this technology cannot be applied in other ways","  designed to be a very efficient heating device, with a very low thermal resistance between the heating element and the air. The heating element is usually a thin metal coil with a large surface area, and the air is blown over it at a high velocity. The heating element is designed to be very thin, so that the air can flow over it very quickly.   also designed to be very compact, so that the air can flow through it very quickly.   also designed to be very efficient, so that the air can flow through it very quickly.   also designed to be very efficient, so that the air can flow through it very quickly.   also designed to be very efficient, so that the air can flow through it very quickly.   also designed to be very efficient, so that the air can flow through it very quickly.   also designed to be very efficient, so that the air can flow through it very quickly.   also designed to be very efficient, so that the air can flow through it very quickly.   also designed to be very efficient, so that the air can flow through it very quickly.   also designed to be very efficient, so that the air can flow through it very quickly.  ","Heat capacity is basically how much heat (think of heat as energy) has to be transferred to a material to increase its temperature. If you heat up water it will take a while because of its high heat capacity, though the metal will be really hot almost immediately (if you have a kettle you can notice how hot the metal part is even after few seconds, -if it's not in contact with water that will cool it down-) air has low heat capacity and will heat up just by passing through the hot hairdryer for less than a second. If you were to do that with water (don't) it wouldn't heat up that much. The motor starts immediately and that gives you the sense of an immediate start. The heating element is just pure resistance and is almost as immediately turned into heat. A toaster is fairly immediate as well, but lacks a fan. Put your hand on top of a toaster and you will remove it almost immediately. Hair dryers are not high tech. What other ways would you expect a heating element to be applied? Before someone asks, automakers have played with the idea of using heating elements for heating in the winter. The issue is they use a fuck ton of power. Power your car would else not be using. A standard 1500w hair drier wouldn't heat your car well but 1500w is 2 horsepower. Instead they pull the heat from water heated by the engine. Heat that would otherwise be rejected into the air outside. It's basically free heat. For reference you can typically say a car passes equal energy into to the cooling system as it produces to the wheels. A 200 kw car dumps roughly 200kw into the cooling system. Same goes for the exhaust, a 200kw car dumps 200kw heat through the exhaust.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 32.06, 'recall': 21.27, 'fmeasure': 25.57}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.37, 'recall': 2.23, 'fmeasure': 2.68}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.66, 'recall': 12.38, 'fmeasure': 14.89}}"
How can it be cheaper for NASA to contract SpaceX instead of running their own missions?,"NASA is responsible for a lot of things, like the space shuttle, and the ISS. SpaceX is responsible for launching things into space. They are very good at it, and they are very cheap at it. NASA can save money by contracting SpaceX to do what they do best, which is launch things into space. It's like if you were a restaurant and you decided to hire a pizza delivery guy to deliver your food instead of doing it yourself. It's cheaper because SpaceX is better at it, and it's what they do for a living.","To generalize a fair amount, NASA has always been where the scientists worked while defense contractors were where the engineers worked. So in the glory days of the Apollo missions, you had NASA scientists figuring out the environmental conditions and then companies like Rockwell and Grumman actually designing the vehicles. In the modern day, all of the science necessary to build space vehicles is largely done and all that remains is the engineering. Since the engineering has always been handled by private companies rather than the government and operations isn't a particularly complex task, it makes sense for private companies to take over most of the task. One big advantage Space X has is the ability to fail publically. This allows both quick innovation, but also simply lowers the bar and cost on safety mechanisms. Not saying that Space X wants to blow up rockets. But the public generally is more okay with watching a private company blow up some rockets, and then pay for the successful launches (even if those successful launches build the failures into the tax payer bill) than they are willing to directly see their tax money blow up. Remember: space X took on a lot of debt in order to finance themselves. That debt was used to engineer a new solution to reuse their first stage boosters. That is a huge cost saving. NASA would likely not have done this as it would have required short term increased government funding for a non critical part of the mission. The free market is often much cheaper than government. They are much more agile and can take more risks. Risks can go bad but they can also yield amazing results. Not to take anything away from SpaceX or Blue Origin or the like but I think it is important to remember that these new companies are building upon decades of experience before them. If they were all starting from scratch I doubt the costs would be much different. At least for quite some time. As has been mentioned, one of the big problems with NASA and many other government programs (like much of the DOD) is all the politics involved in trying to spread as many jobs as possible across as many Congressional districts as possible. Keep in mind NASA does not build stuff itself. Subcontractors do and subs need to make a profit themselves. Too often there are few incentives for them to worry too much about the costs/profit equation. Much of that can be dealt with by better contracts but there is always the mostly negative influence of lobbying politicians which can make that difficult. I don’t recall offhand but I’m pretty sure SpaceX and the like also receive tax incentives (aka corporate welfare) when they hunt for and decide to locate a facility somewhere. Those sorts of incentives/subsidies generally run into the tens of millions of dollars and aren’t usually tallied in the total costs of service. Nasa is not a financially efficent organization. As it's a governmental organization, it has priorities other then profitability. For example when deciding where it's going to place a new facility, factors like local unemployment and political agendas are as much a factor if not more, then where the most cost effective location is. because of this everything Nasa does is a lot more expensive then a private company could do it. Of course the country as a whole recieves many benefits as 'spin offs' that they wouldn't get if private corporations did everything. SpaceX does an amazing amount of vertical integration in their assembly process. That is to say, nearly all of the parts that make up a Falcon 9 rocket/ Dragon spacecraft are manufacture ""in house"". This allows for cheaper parts without sacrificing quality. NASA hasn't done this. They contract parts to the cheapest bidder no matter the location of he company. This results in an increase in manufacturing costs. Once SpaceX starts re-flying their Falcon 9 booster rockets, I would expect their prices to drop even further. Already, they've given their customer for the first booster re-flight a 30% discount on the launch price! NASA paid people to make their rockets, and those people paid other people to make smaller parts and so on. Everyone added more to the price to get their profits. SpaceX does it all by themselves. Edit: I have learned that SpaceX only does *most* of it by themselves. The answer has nothing to do with private vs government. In fact private companies contract out projects all the time. Even contractors sub contract. I can also tell you NASA's board takes its budgeting very seriously and tries to cut costs wherever it can. Any money used improperly hinders the organizations goals. The answer is that it is actually cheaper for NASA to contract out these projects than to build all the facilities and obtain the resources to complete them on their own. NASA isn't and can't be a factory that specializes in producing every single component that goes into space. This is especially true, since the science and components change all the time. Rather, when NASA is in need of a particular thing, it makes much more sense to find a company that can build it for them. Really, it comes down to politics. Our politicians all want their states to get a piece of the pie. Back in the heyday, it was still more of ""Make AMERICA the world leader of space"". Now it's one politician screwing over others and the country just so their district might get money from it. I had many relative working at NASA in the 60's-80's and they all left because the politics ruined it. Also, citizens don't want to accept that there are people willing to die to advance space technology. Not saying they plan on dying, but they know it's possible. The average joe can't grasp that anyone would be OK taking that much risk. They think those people must be forced into it. Or that when an accident does happen, it HAD TO BE A MAJOR screw up, not just a ""honestly we thought of everything, but missed that one tiny detail"". There are different kinds of government contracts. One option is called a cost plus type where the government pays the contractor's costs plus a fee. This can be costly to the government as the burden for overruns is borne by them. It's typically used when the scope of the effort is somewhat unknown and subject to changes or unpredictability. Another type, though, is firm fixed price, which as the name suggests, is where the government pays the contractor only a firm fixed price for the work they do. Any overruns in the cost are borne by the contractor. Any underruns become extra profit for the contractor. The government likes this approach the best as it minimizes their cost risk. This could be how the government is paying Tessa. This is a wonder of the market system! It's the classic story of an upstart finding a better way of doing things and thereby getting ahead of competitors (in this case, ULA, not NASA). NASA and other suppliers have decades of set practices from which they do not like to deviate. For instance, they used custom made electronics for their space vehicles. However, those practices were first introduced in the 60s and 70s but electronics have come quite a long way since then. SpaceX realized this and conducted lots of experiments proving to NASA that commercial, off-the-shelf electronic components were precise and reliable enough to be used in spacecraft. Using these parts dramatically lowers the cost to SpaceX, and this lowering of cost is passed to the customer, NASA. I'd recommend reading ""Elon Musk"" by Ashlee Vance, which is Elon's biography. It touches on just how much cheaper SpaceX really is, and why it is so (including the example cited above). The argument you're making (decades of experience in something) can be made in every single field - Walmart has decades of experience in retail, but Amazon still came out ahead, Ford has decades of experience in building cars but Tesla still got to electric cars first, and so on. The beauty of the market system is that in order to succeed against an incumbent with more experience, the competitor **has** to find a better way to do things, thereby improving things for everyone! Not wanting to be too glib about this but I can tell that by asking this question that you have never worked for a government department. The sheer waste that goes on should be criminal. I worked at Cape Canaveral as a range engineer from 2009-2013. For starters NASA is full of government civilians with more strict labor regulations. SpaceX is full of a wave of new, brilliant, passionate *exempt* engineers willing to work over a hundred hours a week, especially with a launch coming up. Not that many of the NASA workers aren't brilliant/passionate etc. In addition to what everybody else said, sometimes in engineering scrapping processes and technology and starting new streamlines everything because hindsight is 20/20. We have no idea what kind of technical infrastructure NASA has to build their systems but maybe the overhead costs of restructuring for a particular objective or updating technical infrastructure is too costly in time or money and SpaceX is just in a better position to do it right now and much faster.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 77.78, 'recall': 4.79, 'fmeasure': 9.02}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 20.41, 'recall': 1.24, 'fmeasure': 2.35}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 49.49, 'recall': 3.05, 'fmeasure': 5.74}}"
What's the difference between a rotary and a piston engine?,"- The rotary engine is a type of internal combustion engine that rotates around a central axis in one direction while the piston engine rotates in two directions. - The rotary engine uses a rotor, which is a rotating cylinder that contains a crankshaft, while the piston engine uses a piston. - The rotary engine has a single rotor that rotates around the central axis, while the piston engine has multiple pistons that move up and down inside the cylinder. - The rotary engine uses a crankshaft to convert the rotational motion of the rotor into linear motion, while the piston engine uses a connecting rod to convert the linear motion of the piston into rotational motion. - The rotary engine has a crankshaft that is connected to the rotor, while the piston engine has a connecting rod that is connected to the piston. - The rotary engine uses a camshaft to control the timing of the valves, while the piston engine uses a crankshaft to control the timing of the valves. - The rotary engine has a single camshaft that is connected to the rotor, while the piston engine has multiple camshafts that are connected to the piston.  ","Internal combustion engines capture the force of small controlled explosions, and turn that into rotating movement. This is done with pistons. Most engines use conventional pistons which move linearly, back and forth. These can be arranged all in a row, or have the piston cylinders arranged like a star - which is a kind of rotary engine. The downside of linear pistons is they may have to move back and forth more than once for each explosion in order to clear out the exhaust from the previous cycle. Another way of doing it is using a piston that has curved sides but is otherwise designed to wobble around in a mathematically designed path called a trochoid. This makes it so that the piston can fire more continuously, because the gasses of the explosion move around and away from where the fuel is injected. The downside is these engines can have sealing problems, allowing burnt gasses to escape into other parts of the engines. They also don't burn the fuel quite as much, meaning they can pollute more and smell bad. This is what their cycles look like.

"How does the gas meter on a car work, and why does it only work when the engine is on?"," P.S. I'm not asking about the fuel meter, but the gas meter on the car. Edit: I've found out it's called ""tank gauge"". Thank you for your answers. I've found out that it's not the gas meter, but the tank gauge. I'm still curious, how does it work, though.","Depends on the year of the vehicle. My old 1975 ford had a mechanical float and showed the fuel level at all times. On newer cars and it's electrical there's most likely a float in the tank still except it's connected to a sensor. The reason it only works when the car is on is so it doesn't drain the battery. While it would be a small parasitic drain on the battery it would still be constantly drawing power. By having it only on when the vehicle is running the alternator would be charing the battery/providing energy to other systems. What's interesting is watching the fuel gauge in older vehicles when you go over bumps or up hills. I had an old pickup where the gauge would go all over the place anytime the road was bumpy. In the fuel tank there is a variable resistor connected to a float. A circuit passes current through the resistor and senses the resistance. In modern cars, the computer drives the fuel gauge. It drains the battery, so it is only enabled when the ignition is on. The engine does not have to be running. It could be done with a lower power circuit that could display continuously, but there is little demand for that.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.43, 'recall': 11.93, 'fmeasure': 18.98}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.91, 'recall': 2.76, 'fmeasure': 4.41}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.57, 'recall': 7.34, 'fmeasure': 11.68}}"

"How are manufactured products of measurement like measuring tapes, cups, scales etc calibrated.","It depends on the product. For example, a tape measure has a series of metal or plastic strips with marks on them. The marks are calibrated to a known distance (for example, 1 inch). The distance between each mark is known, so the distance between any two marks is also known. For example, if the mark at the end of the tape is 1 inch from the mark at the beginning of the tape, then the distance between the two marks is also 1 inch. A cup is calibrated by comparing it to a known volume of liquid. For example, if the cup is designed to hold 8 ounces of liquid, then it will hold 8 ounces of water.

How does bump starting a car actually work?,"In a car with a battery, the battery is used to power the starter motor. The starter motor is connected to the engine by a gear train.

The engine is not yet running, but the gear train has turned the engine over enough to get the fuel injector to spray fuel into the cylinder.

The revolution of the motor drives all the components, such as fuel delivery, electrical, lubrication, cooling, etc. when you start your car, an electric starter motor is used to get the engine turning and start the self sustaining process. In the case of a pop start, the electric starter motor is not used. You have to find a way get the crank shaft spinning so that it can drive all the components. By rolling the car in neutral, you get the transmission spinning. When you then dump the clutch, the clutch pressure plate will connect to the spinning flywheel, which in turn gets the crankshaft of the engine to start spinning (the same effect the starter motor has) and the engine will start. As far as starting in 2nd or 3rd gear it has to do whith mechanical advantage. 1st gear has the most mechanical advantage, meaning that in 1st gear one revolution of the engine produces the least number of revolutions on the tires. So it stands to reason that the opposite is true when trying to pop start a car. If you try it in first gear, the low gear ratio of 1st will translate into a slower spin of the crankshaft and may not be enough to get the motor to start. By selecting 2nd gear or 3rd gear, when the clutch engages it will spin the crankshaft faster and give you a better chance of spinning the crankshaft fast enough to start the engine. As far as damaging the engine, it really doesn't hurt the engine. The only thing it does do is add extra wear and tear to the clutch in your transmission. The clutch uses friction to link the spinning crankshaft to the drive shaft. When pop starting, the rotating clutch is smashed up against the stationary flywheel, which can wear down the clutch. It's not a totally damaging thing to do by any means, but it's wise to only do it if you have to. Lets start with how an engine works. You have pistons which compress gasoline and then it gets ignited. The explosion drives the piston back, which cause a different piston to compress gasoline. But when an engine is stopped you can't compress the gasoline. Modern cars have when is called a Starter Motor, which is an electric motor that turns the engine to get it started.

If Hexagons are so efficient as a shape. Why are they not more commonly used?,"Hexagons are used in many things. One of the most common uses is as a cellular structure.

The hexagon is also used in the arrangement of cells in the bark of trees, and in the arrangement of coral polyps in coral reefs.

Hexagons are also used in the arrangement of cells in the structures of animals, and in the arrangement of cells in the structures of plants.  ","There are many reasons for using the shapes we do... but one of the big reasons is that hexagons only stack well with other hexagons of the exact same size. Contrast this with squares and rectangles, which a bunch of non-uniform sizes can still pack well. Also the lines between hexagons aren't straight, while the lines between rectangles are. Last, rectangles generalize to three dimensions and remain stackable, while hexagons do not. We build straight roads because they're the most efficient to drive or walk along, with right-angle junctions because they're the easiest and safest to negotiate. That means we make oblong (or square) plots of land, on which we build oblong buildings, in which we put oblong furniture. Smaller oblongs fitting inside bigger oblongs. Hexagons just don't fit. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the efficiency. Consider tiling many squares together. You can very easily end up with one large square. Tiling hexagons, however, doesn't make a large hexagon. You have a rough shape with protruding edges.

","From what I understand, developers make these special versions and send them to torrent sites themselves. So, people who illegally download get a mostly working version that they think is bugged instead of intentionally tampered with. The more it seems like a mechanic or bug, the less they'll catch on and try and find a different torrent. And when it is more common knowledge, people will call them out for pirating when they post on forums for help. There are basically two types of anti-piracy measures: 1. Anti-piracy measures build into the ""proper"" game, this means even legally acquired versions have them. These are not the ""funny"" measures you mention and they mostly lead to the game being unplayable (sometimes even for legit buyers), e.g. Drakensang which among other measures stopped spawning quest-important characters as soon as it detected piracy software running (e.g. Daemon tools). 2. Anti-piracy measures build into a ""fake"" version of the game which is intentionally distributed on piracy channels to send a message, confuse people and make the pirating experience worse. Most companies just decide to upload versions which trackers to nail pirates but other companies get more creative like you described. However these ""effects"" are not part of the ""proper game"" and they also don't trigger by detecting pirated versions, they are just a fixed part of them. Honestly, if the game simply refuses to run, it makes it easier for the pirate to crack in the first place. Pirates often crack games by tinkering around with the game's executable file, deleting or replacing bits of code and then running the game to see if it works or not (Denuvo, which is the current go-to DRM for developers/publishers, works by preventing tampering with the executable file directly). If the game doesn't start up, then good, they've eliminated one option and they move on.

Why can you switch gears without using the clutch?,"When you shift gears, you are changing the ratio of the gear ratios. The gear ratios are determined by the diameter of the wheels and the gear teeth. When you shift gears, you are changing the diameter of the wheels, and the gear teeth are the same. This is why you can shift gears without using the clutch.","Because on a mechanical level, when you can change gears without the clutch, it is because the input and output shafts are rotating at the same speed, and without tensions on the gears. The gears are able to move in and out smoothly. It can be potentially more damaging to the transmission in a vehicle with synchronizers to shift without a clutch, just because of how it's made. You do see floating gears a LOT in the trucking world (heavy duty) though. Truck transmissions do not have synchronizers, so double clutching or floating is required to change gears. Synchronizers, on a basic level, match the speeds of the input and output shafts, so the gears on each shaft don't grind when they interact. In a modern manual transmission the actual gear wheels are in constant contact but freely spin on the output shaft, and the gear selector mechanically connects just one gear wheel at a time to the output shaft. An additional 'synchromesh' allows some slippage. It's only meant to match the gearbox speed to the road speed while the main clutch is depressed, and then releasing the main clutch handles matching the engine speed to that, but the synchros can be misused to do all the clutching. To do this smoothly the engine speed must be set appropriately by the driver using the accelerator, called 'rev matching'. Even then, imperfect rev matching when shifting without using the clutch will wear out the synchros. I advise don't do it routinely in a car you care about. If you find the sweet spot in the rpm's, then the clutch becomes unnecessary. Since there is no tension on the gears it can shift in and out smoothly.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 70.69, 'recall': 14.14, 'fmeasure': 23.56}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 21.05, 'recall': 4.15, 'fmeasure': 6.94}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 44.83, 'recall': 8.97, 'fmeasure': 14.94}}"
Does a larger engine capacity (cc's or Ls) translate to a decreased fuel efficiency and larger fuel consumption rate? What other SIGNIFICANT factors are at play in terms of efficiency and consumption?," Sounds like you're talking about the relationship between displacement and fuel efficiency. It's a complex topic, but the short answer is yes. Displacement is the volume of the piston chamber. More displacement means more volume to move the piston and more work to do. So a 3.0L engine will do more work than a 1.5L engine. More work means more fuel is needed. The relationship is not linear. It's also affected by other factors such as the engine design, fuel type, transmission, and weight of the vehicle.","Internal combustion engines operate with a variable efficiency. At idle, all the energy is going to moving the car parts around, none is going to move the car forward. At high power output, lots of power is going to make the car move, but some is still used to just keep the parts moving around. A large engine is less efficient at idle, because the parts are bigger, and there might be more of them. It might have a higher maximum power output, but that's not an aid to efficiency. The other reason a large engine is less efficient is that it takes a minimum gasoline density for the spark to work. That means that there is a minimum fuel consumption needed to keep the car idling. The larger the displacement, the more air that needs that much fuel. > I'm asking this so that I can make a better informed decision in terms of fuel efficiency and fuel consumption when purchasing my first vehicle. Used/New car dealerships have that information on the cars on a paper on the window. It'll usually have an average ""34 MPG"" with some ratio of city vs highway mileage, since highway driving is more efficient. Fewer stops, less idling in traffic, less acceleration. If fuel efficiency/consumption is your concern, MPG will basically give you the answer you want. Fuel flow rate is this, which produces that much power in these gears on the engine and it means you get the answer of 30 MPG on average. Efficiency is also affected by your driving. Flooring it from a stop to the speed limit is less efficient and harder on your car than a smoother acceleration. You'll also want to avoid idling because you're not doing anything, like waiting with the car on while a passenger goes into the store real quick. I've heard of cars (Europe, I think) that turn off the engine and turn it back on automatically when stopped, like at a red light.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 59.78, 'recall': 16.27, 'fmeasure': 25.58}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.89, 'recall': 2.67, 'fmeasure': 4.21}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.61, 'recall': 8.88, 'fmeasure': 13.95}}"
Why do some cars have one exhaust pipe and others have two of them?,"Cars that have two exhaust pipes are called V8s. The exhaust is split between the two pipes to help with the sound and to reduce the amount of heat that the exhaust system produces. Most cars have two exhaust pipes, but there are some cars that only have one exhaust pipe. Those cars are called V6s. & #x200B; I hope that helps!","Just as a little refresher, [a standard 4-stroke engine has 4 phases]( URL_0 ): 1. *Intake* - piston goes down drawing air + fuel into the cylinder 2. *Compression* - piston goes up compressing air+fuel mix 3. *Power* - **EXPLOSION** drives piston down creating force 4. *Exhaust* - piston goes up pushing burnt fuel out of cylinder Everything but the power phase is ""wasting"" energy. The exhaust and mufflers on a car are there to cut down on the noise of all these explosions going on in the engine. Unfortunately, they create some back-pressure in the system making exhausting slightly harder and robbing the engine of power. A dual exhaust gives you two separate exhaust lines so that there's slightly less pressure, resulting in more power. Downside to dual exhaust is that they're more expensive. Most cars use singles because it's cheaper. An exhaust system's function is to move exhaust gas from an engine's combustion away from the engine. Larger/more powerful engines need to move more air than smaller ones. This can be done 2 ways: a bigger pipe, or more pipes. Deciding which to use is pretty much entirely up to the car designer/manufacturer. So basically, it boils down to: because somebody arbitrarily made it that way. It's an arbitrary decision by the car designer. It is true that the exhaust system creates some back pressure, and that thicker or more pipes would reduce this pressure, but if you look at the pipes under most cars, you'll see one pipe go from the engine through the catalytic converter towards the rear, at which point the single pipe splits into two pipes of the same thickness. Rather pointless, as far as pressures and exhaust gas movement. The decision is determined by aesthetics. We find things that are symmetrical a bit more pleasing than things that are not. Exhaust pipes on both sides of the back of the car = symmetry. If not purely for aesthetics, then it's because of cylinder configuration. Inline engines will have one bank of exhaust headers, a v-shaped will have two.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 65.57, 'recall': 11.33, 'fmeasure': 19.32}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.67, 'recall': 2.84, 'fmeasure': 4.85}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.34, 'recall': 6.8, 'fmeasure': 11.59}}"

How do engineers figure out how much torque is the correct amount for a bolt when bolting something in place?,"I've worked on a few projects where we've done this. The first thing we do is find the torque value for the fastener itself. Most fasteners have a specific torque value that they're designed to handle. Then we calculate the torque value that we need to apply to the fastener to make sure it's securely fastened to the surrounding material. The fastener will actually be applying a force to the surrounding material, and that force needs to be resisted by the fastener. This is why you need to tighten the fastener to a certain torque value. The torque value is calculated based on the amount of force the fastener is applying, and the material it's applying that force to. The formula for this is usually something like this: Torque = Force x Distance Torque = 1000 N x 0.1m = 100 Nm Torque = 100 Nm x 0.01m = 1 Nm The fastener is applying a force of 1000 N to the surrounding material, and the distance between the fastener and the surrounding material is 0.1m. So the torque is 100 Nm. Then we can calculate the torque needed to make sure the fastener is securely fastened to the surrounding material.  ","You can take the diameter of the bolt and the thread to calculate the tensile strength of the fastener. Once you know where it fails, you can then set the torque amount below that. I remember my auto shop teacher telling me to ""tighten it until it breaks, then back it off half a turn."" He was obviously joking, but that is pretty much where the Torque specs come from: just shy of breaking. There is a formula: > T = c * D * F T = Torque required F = Bolt tension desired (Axial Load) D = Nominal bolt diameter c = Coefficient of friction constant The idea is that the bolt has to take a certain load, and they never want the parts to relieve the tension, because then the bolt could shake loose. Your torque wrench preloads the bolt to prevent this. While the torque can be calculated, for critical applications a torque test must be done. A very basic test consists of the joint stackup (the part you're threading into plus any parts that are clamped, plus the bolt/fastener) being torqued to failure while measuring torque and angle of rotation. Typically you would do 30 samples at minimum to get statistically significant results. Preferably you'd do more samples. Once you have data, you set the torque target somewhere between the joint starting to clamp and joint failure. Statistical analysis helps for this step.

How potholes happen in roads,"A pothole is a hole in the road, usually caused by water penetrating the road surface. Water seeps into the road, and then freezes in the winter.

I live in Pothole Country. For us, we have the standard asphalt roads. Our winters are extremely wet (depends on where you are) and cold, like -44F cold. The second there is a crevice in the asphalt for water to seep in and freeze, you're going to get a pothole eventually. The water expands as it freezes, creating cracks. These cracks let in more water, meaning the crack grows rapidly. The earth around the crack heaves and settles as temperatures fluctuate and destroys the integrity of the surrounding material, which then breaks apart and creates a hole in the road. Roads are made from asphalt. Little rocks suspended in a tar to create a hard surface. As you drive along the road, there is a tiny chance that one of the rocks gets picked up by your tire and flung at some guy's windshield. When that happens, the integrity of the road drops at that exact spot, making it easier for other cars to chip away at the road. That erosion causes a hole to form in the road. It has a lot to do with the material underneath the paving, if one little spot of the fill material (gravel and such) wasn't compacted right, it settles over time under the paving and makes a little cavity. That hole cracks open, is subject to rain and other erosion, and you get a pothole.

This means that you can sell cars that are cheaper, and therefore more popular.","For a long time, American cars were often of lesser quality than Japanese and European cars, they had defects in manufacturing and used often substandard parts and processes to build cars--and they were known for it, everyone knew they just weren't as good, reliable, and such, even the companies making them, and they didn't do much to hide that. Producing cars, effectively, cheaply, and profitably is hard, and the process that was being used to make American cars produced a lot more quality issues than those produced elsewhere There is actually an entire field of quality management / production operations pioneered by the Japanese called Total Quality Management (TQM) [Also called Lean, or Lean Six Sigma, or the Toyota Production System] Who's whole purpose was that it was cheaper, better, and more efficient to produce goods (in this case cars) with as little quality issues as possible. That is produce quality goods with no defects, over and over and over. This system, through much investigation and research turned out to be crazy effective. And now it is used in manufacturing of just about everything across industries and around the world. This is the process that was used in Japanese car manufacturing, and to a degree, those in Europe as well Now back to american cars. Well, until the mid 90s, American cars were crap quality compared to many foreign ones, foreign cars used the system above and made quality cars with little defects, Americans did not, and had lots of issues. So the Americans took notice, and started changing their systems, the Japanese car companies even helped, it was a problem they all wanted to solve. By the mid 2000s American cars were as quality as made anywhere else, and today, American cars are often even higher quality than anywhere else (although everyone is making great quality cars, so differences are small) The stigma still sticks though, even though current, and last decade or so American cars are very high quality, and foreign cars are the same, American cars have not outgrown the old ideas that they are crap. For what it's worth, in the UK at least the reputations are that Japanese and German cars are reliable and quality, whereas French and Italian stuff breaks down. The old bad British car companies, with workforces that spent a lot of time on strike, have pretty much all gone bust. American brands that make cars in Europe for Europe such as Ford are well-regarded, but actual American cars are seen as a bit rubbish. To be fair, we tend to look for different things.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.03, 'recall': 23.97, 'fmeasure': 30.79}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.7, 'recall': 2.06, 'fmeasure': 2.65}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.31, 'recall': 11.87, 'fmeasure': 15.25}}"

Why is the triangle the 'strongest shape'?,"I'm going to try to answer this without getting into the math, but I think I can explain it without getting too technical. The reason the triangle is the strongest shape is because it has the most stable structure. A square, for example, is very stable, but it has four corners. A square with four corners is very unstable. It's like a square with a corner missing. A triangle, on the other hand, has only three corners. So it's not as stable as a square, but it's still more stable than a square with four corners. The reason it's not as stable as a square is because the corners of a square are all equal distance from the center.  . So if you were to apply a force to the center of the triangle, the two corners closest to the center would be the first to break. This is why a square is more stable than a triangle. But if you were to apply a force to the corner of a square, the square would break in a different way. The two corners closest to the center would break first, but then the two corners farthest from the center would break. This is because the corners of a square are all equal distance from the center.  ","Because you can't change the angles without change the lengths of the sides. With a square, it can deform into a rhombus without bending or otherwise changing the lengths of the sides. With an equilateral triangle, you have to do both. Technically a perfect circle is, because there are zero weak spots, because there are no corners. It's because there are three corners, so therefore less build up of pressure than there would be in another shape, so each point can handle more pressure. Because the lengths of the sides of a triangle are enough to define the shape. With a square or rectangle you can maintain the side length and still distort the shape into a rhombus or parallelogram. In other words, maintaining a square shape is relying on the strength at the corners to maintain the angles but a triangle only relies on the strength of the sides to maintain their length.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 33.18, 'recall': 46.79, 'fmeasure': 38.83}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.76, 'recall': 10.97, 'fmeasure': 9.09}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.73, 'recall': 25.0, 'fmeasure': 20.74}}"
What makes a telescope different than a telephoto lens?,"]( URL_0 ) > The lens is designed to focus light onto a sensor or film. The telescope is designed to focus light onto a larger sensor or film. It's not really the same thing. There is a difference between a telescope and a telephoto lens. A telescope is a lens that is designed to gather and focus light. It is typically used to view distant objects in the sky such as planets, stars, and galaxies. A telephoto lens is a lens that is designed to gather and focus light. It is typically used to view distant objects in the sky such as planets, stars, and galaxies. The difference is that a telescope is designed to gather more light than a telephoto lens. This is because telescopes are designed to gather light from much farther away than telephoto lenses are. A telescope is used to view things in space that are very far away, while a telephoto lens is used to view things in space that are much closer to us. A telescope is like a pair of binoculars, it collects light and focuses it to a small point. A telephoto lens is like a camera lens, it collects light and focuses it to a small point, but it also compresses the image so that it looks closer to the lens than it actually is.","A telescope and a long focal length camera lens do pretty much the same job, but there are some differences: * Camera lenses nearly always use just lenses. Telescopes can use lenses, mirrors, or both. * Camera lenses are designed to focus over a range of distances, which can mean compromises. Telescopes are designed purely for focusing on distant stars, 'infinity' in photography terms. * Telescopes are designed to capture as much light as possible. That usually means just two or three glass elements because each surface loses some light. Camera lenses don't worry about that so much and often have lots of glass elements. * Camera lenses are designed for use with variable aperture - the diameter of the opening for light to go through. They may compromise sharpness at wide aperture, and they need a clear light path down the middle for small aperture (which is one reason they rarely use mirror designs). Telescopes are generally designed for use 'wide-open' only and need to perform well at it. * Long focal length camera lenses invariably use the 'telephoto group', a lens arrangement to make the focal length longer than the physical length. Long focal length telescopes are often physically long, although not always. * Telescopes get physically much wider - again, it's light transmission. For example the Skywatcher Skyliner 300P is a £1000 amateur telescope with a 300 mm (12 inch) diameter main mirror. In camera terms it's a 1500 mm f/5 (mirror) lens, and a comparable camera lens would cost over ten times as much. And that's just amateur stuff - professional astronomers use telescopes with main mirrors several *metres* across. * Camera lenses have autofocus. Amateur telescopes usually have manual focus. * For photography, normal photographers use exposure times of fractions of a second. Astronomy photographers use exposures of several *minutes*. That means the mounting needs to be rock solid, far more so than a typical camera tripod, and also compensate for the Earth's rotation. Because of the 'bang for your buck' performance, terrestrial photographers interested in extreme telephoto shooting often turn to amateur astronomical telescopes despite the drawbacks.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 41.96, 'recall': 26.93, 'fmeasure': 32.81}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.73, 'recall': 4.31, 'fmeasure': 5.25}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.54, 'recall': 13.18, 'fmeasure': 16.06}}"
"why do wood fires burn so slowly, but house fires with even greater area to cover seem to be rather quick?","Wood is not a very flammable material. It's mostly cellulose, which is very hard to burn. To burn wood, you need to heat it up to a very high temperature, and even then, it's hard to get it to burn. That's why you need a lot of wood to get a fire going. House fires, on the other hand, are made up of mostly plastics, which are very flammable. Plastics burn very easily, and they burn very quickly. The fire spreads very quickly because the plastics are spread out over a large area. The fire doesn't spread in a wood fire because there is no plastic to burn.","The wooden structure itself actually doesn't burn that fast, and if you look at the remains of a structure fire, you'll notice that a lot of the wood is mostly in tact. The fire just weakens it enough for it to collapse, if it does at all. It's the furniture, carpets, etc. that burn so fast. Especially curtains. Curtains are a HUGE fire hazard. In addition to the other comments, the structure of a standard campfire (3-4 logs making a triangle into each other) contributes to it. In this campfire, the logs burn, some of the heat radiates into the other logs, but most of it rises, away from the campfire, and into the air. This heat is lost, and it flies away. The flames on the log crawl up the log at about a 45 degree angle, where they contact a small amount of neighboring wood, and a lot of air. You may notice that as the logs ember, they drop coals in a pile under the logs. These embers sustain the fire by radiating the heat upward (into the logs) and empowering the flames on the underside of the logs. In a housefire, the fire doesn't radiate the heat away. (until you breach a wall, or ceiling) The heat radiates into nearby furniture, walls, whatever, retaining that heat. This spreads the fire much faster by having everything heat up. For flames on a vertical wall, the actual flame is in contact with the wood directly above it, far more than a log at 45 degrees, which accelerates the burning of that piece of wood. In a housefire, there is also a much greater quantity of fuel. As the wood starts embering, there is simply so much more fuel to burn. The embers land, spread their heat to their surroundings and then those surroundings burn and ember and so forth. The fact that a house is a box-like structure means that it contains the heat and accumulates it, like an oven, whereas an open campfire is always losing heat to the air and wind. TL:DR - fire burning things is a reaction that is controlled by the amount of heat being retained, the amount of fuel in contact with flame. Houses on fire hold the heat, spread it more effectively, and are simply larger. I'm a person responsible for fire testing of architectural products and here is my take on it. A commercial or residential window shade will burn if in the path of a flame, otherwise it self extinguishes. Similarly the walls and furniture will burn if in contact with a flame from a source like a carpet or other flooring surface. Ceiling tiles will burn if in path of a flame off of desks and sofas. The intensity of the fire will determine the flame height and the materials in the room affected by the flame. The reason the campfire takes so long is because the logs were not stacked in order to enable the lower burning logs to ignite those above them. Next time try slicing the log with slits in it and see how much faster it burns. It has to do with accessibility to air. A solid log burns slowly while the slit logs burns faster because the air reaches inside the slits. Any burnable surface in contact with both air and a flame will burn quickly. I work wit a volunteer fire fighter. We were talking about the speed difference in modern and old houses. Modern houses are filled with plastic and synthetic material so burn damn fast! Old wooden houses are much slower. Its about surface area as much as anything else. Yes there may differences in flammability but surface area is much more important. The greater the surface area the greater the exposure to oxygen. I think the real answer is that you are comparing the acceleration of a fire to complete consumption. If a house fire was to lead to the complete consumption of the available fuel it would take a very long time.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 67.86, 'recall': 11.16, 'fmeasure': 19.17}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.02, 'recall': 2.94, 'fmeasure': 5.06}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.82, 'recall': 5.73, 'fmeasure': 9.84}}"
Why are German products higher quality?," In short, it's the country's culture. Germany has a strong work ethic and is very organized.

","Germany was one of the first countries to get mass amounts of high quality steel by way of Krupp steel. This led to the development of higher precision machine tools and higher quality metal goods. This reputation has survived largely because of this history but now Germany can't compete in the cheap markets where Asian business dominates. Instead they stick with premium goods at a high price. it's certainly not true for all german products, but it's just good business to maintain an expectation of high quality to build customer loyalty I wouldn't say it has anything to do with any crazy engineering or anything. Germans just don't settle for shit. If something breaks or is unsatisfactory, they will let it be known. I think that is the main reason. If you are complacent and accept it, of course its going to keep happening. Because they can't compete in price. So they have to use higher quality to distinguish themselves. I think it's also partially a cultural thing. Hopefully someone will expand on this in greater detail because I'm on the toilet at work on mobile right now, but here goes. IIRC German engineering grew into the powerhouse that it is today, following their defeat in WWII. One of the provisions within the Morgenthau & Marshall Plans (basically a plan giving Germany the finger for being huge DB's during WWII, while trying to make sure they wouldn't ever be able to go for round III) was that Germany wouldn't be able to spend anything having to do with military operations or development. *Obviously this is a gross oversimplification, but I'm going off memory and I'm on the toilet so cut me some slack.* Consequently all of the engineers and businesses that had been part of the German war machine transitioned to private industries. Since the money that the German gov. had previously been spending on being dicks to all of Europe was now just laying around (not counting all the money they had to pay out for reparations), they decided to invest in domestic infrastructure. All of the aforementioned factors [many omitted], in addition to the efficiency of German production, and absolute necessity were driving forces in Germany's post-war reconstruction. Tldr: Germany wasn't allowed to make shit that went ""boom"" after WWII, but the engineering nerds who were previously working in the war effort still needed to make money. Instead of designing/producing weapons & war machines, they began focusing on making cars & shit to sell to the chumps across the pond in Freedomland. This is all going off what I remember from a one day section in my AP Gov class during my junior year of high school. There's probably more holes in this crude account of history than Swiss cheese, so hopefully one of the kids I used to copy off can pop in and clear it up for you. What I was taught in Design History was that German products used to be of lesser quality before the 20th century, so they formed the [Deutscher Werkbund]( URL_0 ) , an association of industrialists, craftsmen, architects etc. to make better products and rebrand ""Made in Germany"" as a sign of quality. There was a TIL I think a few days ago about the Made in [Country] mark, saying the British invented it (near the end of 19th century) to mark foreign goods which were generally of inferior quality. Another aspect of their current quality is the coupling of specialist high schools with the industry where they basically train their employees from day one. *disclaimer: I am a trained industrial designer, not a design historian, so I welcome any addition/correction to this* You're assuming they ARE higher quality, which I'm not sure is the case. For example, here's a 2016 vehicle quality study: URL_0 Porsche is near the top, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes are just above the middle, and VW is down near the bottom. Edit: I've had several replies about the minutia of my post, without addressing my point: that OP's premise isn't necessarily a good one, so it's hard to explain. In 2006 I visited a manufacturing facility in Germany that was recently purchased by the company that I worked for here in western PA. While standing on a mezzanine deck overlooking the shop floor, one of the German engineers proudly asked me if I had ever seen an operation quite like his before. When I answered that it looked very much like the operations that we had back home he seemed very disappointed. I was just telling the truth. Their manufacturing floor and the one back home pretty much looked and operated the same. And I already knew the western PA work ethic and work quality was outstanding. Most products aren't actually higher quality. People just assume they are because they're imported (which often raises the price) and from Germany. It's kinda like how people assume that Italian cars are high quality cars because everyone knows Maserati, Ferrari, Lamborghini, etc, but anyone that's ever actually driven a Maserati or Ferrari knows that they're crap and you're really just paying for the emblem on the front. They aren't. The 'brilliant German engineering' trope appeared around the 60s and 70s when Germany went through an economic boom fueled by post war investment. Manufacturing industries flourished and German cars in particular became a huge export. These cars were good and the marketing team advertised them as premium vehicles overseas. In Germany they were just normal cars. Despite this, Germany began building a public image of having the best engineers in the world. Before and since then the trope hasn't really applied. There are plenty of shockingly back German cars around, and other terrible German products. Also plenty of great German cars and products still. However some clever marketing from 50 years ago has stuck. The German national ethos includes a penchant for attention to detail. Germans don't say, ""ah, that's good enough."" Instead they say ""How can we make this better?"" I'm generalizing of course, but geez, they've had laws about beer purity forever. If you're so serious about beer, how serious are you going to be about cars, train schedules, and firearms? As stated above not all german products are higher quality. I think one reason for better quality in some areas, despite the histroy, is the legislation in Germany, the consumer organisations and quality seals, which carry a lot of weight. For example the [Stiftung Warentest]( URL_0 ), a independent organisation, that tests products and compares them or the product liability as a EU directive ( EG-Directive 85/374 EG.)","{'rouge1': {'precision': 71.28, 'recall': 12.2, 'fmeasure': 20.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.79, 'recall': 1.67, 'fmeasure': 2.85}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.87, 'recall': 5.97, 'fmeasure': 10.19}}"
a major problem with renewable energy like wind and solar is storing energy when the source (wind or sunshine) is not available. Why can't they just use water?,It's not just water that's the problem. You need a lot of water. And that water has to be in a place that's not too far from where the power is needed. And the water has to be able to flow fast enough.   able to flow up to the power plant.   able to flow out of the power plant.   able to flow back down to the water source.   able to flow through the power plant.   able to flow through the power lines.   able to flow through the substation.   able to flow through the transformers.   able to flow through the transmission lines.   able to flow through the distribution lines.   able to flow through the transformers.   able to flow through the distribution lines.   able to flow through the transformers.   able to flow through the transmission lines.   able to flow through the distribution lines.   able to flow through the transformers.  ,"This is called pumped storage and it's commonly used wherever there is a good place to put a reservoir in. But there are many places in the world where there isn't a convenient large hill nearby, and because of the huge amount of water involved it's not possible to build something from scratch on flat ground. This is being done. If you look at the new additions to the high power grid of Europe a lot of the new lines are between mountainous regions in the alps and Scandinavia where they have a lot of hydroelectric power plants and flat areas where there is more wind and solar as well as more cities. This is in preparation to go away from coal and gas. But even this might be enough. The problem is with high speed pickups. When you switch on a kettle that energy have to be already in the power grid. It is not enough to have it in form of water on top of a mountain. In traditional coal, hydro, gas or nuclear power plants there is a big heavy turbine that contains a lot of energy. When you switch on your kettle the turbines will move a tiny bit slower as you use their energy. To keep up the speed there is a need to change the flow of water to the turbine but this is a process that takes seconds. The turbine have lots of energy that is available in milliseconds to anywhere in the grid where it is needed. So to keep a pumping hydro plant working you would have to run the turbines all the time to keep them spinning. And the pumping is not going to be as efficient as you might think. Nuclear power is a very good option and does complement the existing hydro plants and allows for more wind and solar as well.

Why is all glass not safety glass?,"There are a couple of reasons why not all glass is safety glass. The first is that it's not necessarily safer. Safety glass is designed to shatter into small, blunt pieces instead of sharp shards. This is safer because if the glass does break, it's less likely to cut you. However, safety glass is also more expensive. If a manufacturer can save money by using regular glass instead of safety glass, they're going to do that. The other reason is that safety glass is not necessary for all glass in a vehicle. The windshield is the most important piece of glass in a vehicle, so it's where safety glass is most important. However, the other windows in a vehicle are not nearly as important. They don't need to be safety glass, because if they break, the glass will likely be contained within the vehicle and won't cause any injuries.","for general use, cost. car windshield glass is laminated. it's actually two pieces of glass with a clear glue in the middle. it doesn't shatter into million pieces when it breaks. windshield glass also needs to be mostly distortion free. you'll note that windshields are bent, but when you look thru them, the image is not bent. car side window glass is not laminated, but it's still special glass. it's tempered. it's stronger than just ""normal"" glass. but it shatters into many pieces when it breaks. then there's glass made for ever other specialty application. optical glass doesn't need to be super strong or not shatter. it needs to be very clear and very distortion free. gorilla glass is very scratch and shatter resistant. and very pricey. UV protection glass filters out UV light. residential window glass is treated for filtering our both UV and IR light. Most probable reason? Price. Plain glass is much cheaper than shock resistant glass, or even scratch resistant glass or so. All these improvements make the product a tad more expensive and sometimes this difference gets bit enough to matter. We could also say that in some situations a heat tempered glass piece is just plain stupid. Imagine if a window in you house got hit by a sharp rock. If it was a heat tempered piece it would shatter in a million pieces and cleaning that would be a pain in the butt. Now, if we use plain glass it just breaks into big chunks near the impact. See?

Why isn't the power grid underground like plumbing/sewers/water lines?,"The main reason is that it's very difficult to bury a cable in the ground.

If the power lines were buried in the ground, it would be much more difficult to replace them.","It is sometimes. Running power underground is expensive, but will fail less often. But when it does break, it's expensive to repair. Running power overhead is cheap. It's more fragile, but also quick and easy to repair. Water and sewer lines are underground for some key reasons. One, they are heavy. Very heavy. So not only do you need very strong towers to hold them, if they fall they can do some serious damage. And also, they are gravity driven. Especially for the sewers, those lines need to be below that of your house so that things will drain away. Electricity doesn't care about gravity. Especially with high voltage (carrying over long distance) lines, there is an immense cost in underground lines. One of the reasons is that air is actually a pretty good insulator. But it can't be used as an insulator in buried cables. To insulate those high-class lines, a lot of material is required, which also means the cables will be quite large when buried. In addition, underground cables are prone to damage, from natural causes or accidents, and are difficult to maintance. The power lines in my neighborhood are buried. A few years ago I lost power, and the power company told me that one of my lines had broken due to the soil shifting over time. Because they were buried, they were *my* responsibility to repair, where if they had been aboveground the power company would have repaired them. So I had to spend $3000 to have new lines put in. Exposed power lines are a PITA, but buried power lines are very expensive to maintain.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.95, 'recall': 20.29, 'fmeasure': 30.19}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.7, 'recall': 4.0, 'fmeasure': 5.96}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.47, 'recall': 10.14, 'fmeasure': 15.09}}"
Why is it that only hatchbacks/SUVS have a rear windshield wiper when they're the ones that need it the least?,"Љ� The answer is that hatchbacks and SUVs are more practical for everyday use than sedans and coupes. They are bigger and have more space for passengers and cargo. They are also more likely to be used for long trips, where rain and windshield wipers are important. As a result, they are more likely to be driven in bad weather, and therefore need wipers. The wipers are not as important on sedans and coupes, which are generally driven in better weather. This is a cultural thing. In the US, sedans are considered ""sporty"" and are the preferred vehicle for people who want to drive fast and show off. In Europe, SUVs and hatchbacks are considered ""practical"" and are the preferred vehicle for people who want to drive a lot and haul a lot of stuff. In the US, sedans are generally more expensive than SUVs and hatchbacks, and are generally considered to be more luxurious. In Europe, SUVs and hatchbacks are generally more expensive than sedans, and are generally considered to be more practical. In the US, sedans are generally more powerful than SUVs and hatchbacks, and are generally considered to be more sporty.  ","They aren't the ones who need it the least if you think about dirt. Cars with a trunk and a more angled rear window will see more rain hit the window, but cars with a flat rear end will see maximum air pressure pushing up dirt/grime into the back of the car. For this reason, these cars often have rear windshield wipers.. for the dirt that is more likely to accumulate, etc.. not necessarily for the rain. Aerodynamics can be counterintuitive. The flat vertical back of a hatchback or SUV creates turbulent air behind it that can then deposit dirt on the rear window. I drive a hatchback and it's true I tend to just use the rear wiper for one or two wipes, but that's one or two more than zero!","{'rouge1': {'precision': 21.24, 'recall': 30.15, 'fmeasure': 24.92}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.08, 'recall': 2.96, 'fmeasure': 2.45}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 11.4, 'recall': 16.18, 'fmeasure': 13.37}}"
How is an engine affected by +/- degree(s) of timing?,"The engine will run at a slightly different speed. When the timing is off, the engine is not running at its most efficient. It can also cause the engine to burn more fuel than it should. This is why it's important to have the timing checked. The engine will also be noisier than it should be. This is because the engine is not running at its most efficient.","There are two type of timing: ignition timing and valve timing. When you see someone talking about adding/subtracting a few degrees, they're probably talking about ignition timing. Ignition timing is when the spark plugs fire in relation to the position of the piston. Getting it right is a balance between igniting at the highest compression (closest to Top Dead Center for the piston) and making sure the spark has enough time to ignite the air/fuel mixture. Getting closer to TDC will increase power, but advancing the timing can cause the spark to start so late that the fuel doesn't completely burn, causing a reduction of power and drivability issues. Since stock engines are usually tuned very cautiously, advancing the timing a little is generally a good way to get some extra power. Granted, there's WAY more to it than that (vacuum advance, ignition at different RPMs, computer controls, the effect of different manifolds, etc.) to really understand how to use timing to tune, but that would turn this into ""Explain Like I'm an Experienced Engine Builder.""","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.93, 'recall': 17.03, 'fmeasure': 24.7}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.35, 'recall': 2.76, 'fmeasure': 4.02}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.09, 'recall': 9.89, 'fmeasure': 14.34}}"
Why do we have a space station when we could have a moon base?,"There are a lot of reasons, but one of the big ones is that the moon has no atmosphere, so there is no air for us to breathe. The International Space Station is designed to be able to support life for extended periods of time, and to be able to do a lot of things that a moon base couldn't. It's also a lot easier to get to than the moon, and it's a lot closer to Earth. There are also a lot of things that we can do on the ISS that we can't do on the moon, because the moon doesn't have the same kind of gravity. For example, the ISS is designed to be able to do a lot of experiments on living things, and the moon doesn't have enough gravity to support that. The ISS is also designed to be able to support a lot of people, and the moon is much smaller than the Earth, so it would be hard to support a lot of people on the moon.","There are some great images from XKCD's What If blog that I'm gonna shameless steal from: [This is probably what you imagine when you think of space]( URL_1 ) But in truth, it actually looks [more like this]( URL_0 ) The international space station is 400km away from earth, that's about forty times higher than the maximum cruising flight of most aircraft. The moon on the other hand, is over 380,000km away from earth. Almost a thousand times further away! Worse still, it has its own gravitational field so getting back to Earth requires a huge amount of fuel, whereas a shuttle leaving the international space station only needs to slow down a bit in the opposite direction of its orbit to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. The moon is significantly further away. The ISS is about 250 miles away from Earth. The moon is about 250,000 miles from Earth. Every planet in our solar system can fit between the Earth and moon. It's about 10 times the circumference of the Earth. In addition to the practical issues with building a moon base, a major purpose of the ISS is to do experiments to see how things behave in zero gravity. You can't do that on the surface of the moon, you have to be in orbit. Traveling to the moon would take a lot more fuel and weight and the more weight, the more fuel that is needed; which costs money... a lot of money Because of the Space Shuttle. The space huttle was the primary means for constructing the space station, but it can not leave Low Earth orbit. As such, there was no way to have a moon base. The ISS is close enough to not require huge amounts of fuel, money, and time to get to. Other than geology, there isn't much more that could be done on the moon that can't be done on ISS. Why would we have a moon base when we can have a more useful space station instead? The space station allows for microgravity experiments which you can't do on the moon. It's also nice and close (relatively speaking) so we can fairly easily shuttle things up and down to the space station. Getting things to and from the moon is a lot harder as the moon is 1000x further away and has its own gravity so you need rockets again to land there and get away from it again. Plus, there's not much interesting stuff we could do on the moon that we can't do either in space or on Earth.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 74.44, 'recall': 30.18, 'fmeasure': 42.95}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 25.7, 'recall': 10.38, 'fmeasure': 14.79}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 36.11, 'recall': 14.64, 'fmeasure': 20.83}}"

We can't very well put supports on that, so we'd be talking about a floating bridge... While the technology for building a floating bridge does exist, building one of that scale, in an area that is routinely plagued by the hurricanes that visit the region on a yearly basis would make it very implausible to construct, maintain and keep safe a bridge that spans such a very long distance. Also, as far as accidents go, people are stupid. One accident would back the bridge up for.... the entire bridge. 90 miles of traffic jam due to an accident would be unsolvable. You've also got to look at how many people would actually USE the bridge. Theres only about 5,000 registered vehicles in Cuba, and mainly the use would either be tourists or travellers. 90+ miles for businesses is more easily done with a plane-ride than in a truck due to sheer speed alone.

"The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was designed to curve along the earths. Yet, the water under it stays does not curve along the earth. How could it be if the earth is a sphere?","The water under the bridge does not curve along the earth because the earth is not a perfect sphere. The earth is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. This is due to the effects of the moon's gravitational pull on the earth's oceans. The shape of the earth is called an oblate spheroid, which is a flattened sphere. This is why the water under the bridge stays flat.","While it may have been designed to curve concentric with the Earth, the arc you see is because suspension bridge are also designed to be hump shaped so that they go flat when heavily loaded. The Earth's curvature is much""flatter"" than the arc you see in the bridge. The water has the arc of the Earth. The water does curve, but it's a much smaller curvature than that of the bridge, which is exaggerated for the structural reasons mentioned already. The bridge as a whole does take the Earth's curvature in to account e.g. the two towers are not parallel to each other, but that doesn't mean that the roadway has to follow the precise curvature of the Earth. The structural reason for the exaggerated upward curvature of bridge roadways goes something like this: with the roadway curved upwards, when you load it with cars and trucks, the forces generated are translates sideways, so that the roadway pushes outwards against its buttresses, which are built to take that. If the roadway was sagging below level at any time, that would mean *tension* (pulling in) at the ends, which would be a really bad thing, structurally - it's much harder to handle tension in the ground. So the upwards curvature is exaggerated to make sure that the roadway could never sag, under any conditions.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.81, 'recall': 19.65, 'fmeasure': 29.7}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.18, 'recall': 6.14, 'fmeasure': 9.3}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 35.14, 'recall': 11.35, 'fmeasure': 17.16}}"
Why does road construction take so amazingly long?," Lets say you have a company that is contracted to build a road.   company has 1000 workers, 1000 trucks, and 1000 pieces of equipment.   company is paid to build 100 miles of road.   cost of building that road is $100 million.   company has 200 days to build that road.   company has to hire workers, buy trucks, and buy equipment.   company has to get the materials to the job site and pay the workers to build the road.   company has to get the finished road to the job site and pay the workers to drive the trucks and equipment.   company has to pay the workers, pay the trucks, and pay the equipment.   company has to pay for all of the materials, pay for the fuel, and pay for the equipment.   company has to pay for all of the workers, pay for the fuel, and pay for the equipment.   company has to pay for all of the workers, pay for the fuel, and pay for the equipment.   company has to pay for all of the workers, pay for the fuel, and pay for the equipment.   company has to pay for all of the workers, pay for the fuel, and pay for the equipment.   company has to pay for all of the workers, pay for the fuel, and pay for the equipment.

Add in the bureaucracy that it takes to make sure the road goes over only the correct property, lines up with waster water drains and power lines, and a dozen other things I probably have no idea about and it ends up taking a long time.

The concept of engineering a bridge,"is to design it in such a way that it can withstand the forces that are applied to it, such as the weight of cars and trucks, wind and weather, and the forces that are generated by earthquakes. Lets start with the concept of forces. A force is an action that causes an object to move. In the case of a bridge, the forces can be applied by the cars and trucks that drive on it. The weight of these vehicles is one of the forces that is applied. In addition, there are other forces that can be applied, such as the forces generated by wind and weather. These forces can cause the bridge to sway or bend, which can be a problem. To prevent this, engineers design the bridge to be strong enough to resist these forces. Engineers also consider the forces that are generated by earthquakes. Earthquakes are sudden movements of the earths crust, which can be caused by a variety of factors, such as the movement of tectonic plates, volcanic activity, or the collapse of a cave. These movements can cause the bridge to vibrate, which can cause it to crack or break. Engineers design the bridge to be able to withstand these forces. The design of a bridge is typically divided into three parts: the piers, the abutments, and the superstructure.  ","Most bridges are owned by the Government. The government hires an engineering firm to design the bridge, taking into account many variables that would impact the life of the bridge. Either the architect, or the government will ask contractors for pricing at a certain time and day. The bid will have wording to make sure only good contractors prices will be used. The government and architect review the pricing and determine if it's reasonable. A contract is issued, then work begins. There isn't a single bridge design that is always used, the design varies based upon length of the bridge, expected weight of things using the bridge, height, etc...

how do plane formations (specifically jet display formations) keep their speeds identical for extended periods of time?,"The formation is called a ""delta"" formation. It's a group of 4 aircraft flying in a V-formation. The center aircraft is the leader, and the other 3 aircraft are the ""wingmen"".

To directly answer your question, it's as simple as trying to drive the same speed as a car next to you on the highway. Add more gas if you're getting behind him, reduce it if you're getting ahead of him. You can do this on a bike or even walking next to a stranger. In jet formations, the leader of the formation tries to make it easy by keeping the same speed. As promised, a little more in depth... Flying in formation requires no instrumentation or advanced aircraft systems or computers. It breaks down into a few simple components. **1) Knowing where you want to be relative to the other plane.** In formation flying, the position you need to be in depends on what you're trying to accomplish. It can be arbitrary or have a specific purpose. You can try to be directly side-by-side, at an angle, behind and above/below... it's only limited by how easily you can see the other plane. As an example, the most common formation you will see is called parade. It's a tight formation that's used for things like flying together through low visibility, checking the other jet for damage, etc. [To fly perfect parade F-18 pilots have reference points.]( URL_0 ). For position, the pilot is trying to put the tip of the missile launcher rail of the jet he is following (in orange) on the headrest of that jet. The red line shows how they line up. For distance, he is trying to line up with the end of the exhaust nozzles (green line) For other formations, there are other reference points. For planes or positions without defined reference points, a pilot can use his own cockpit for reference, create ones when he gets close, or use intuition. **2) Recognizing when you aren't.** When things don't line up, it's pretty obvious. If, from your perspective, the tip of the launcher is in front of the headrest. You are behind, and need to move forward by ""moving"" the rail back. If the rail appears above the headrest, you are low, and need to pull up to ""move"" the rail down. A big part of this is seeing the movement before it gets too big. To be precise, corrections are made before the error becomes too big. **3) Knowing how to get from where you don't want to be to where you want to be.** This will totally answer how speeds can be matched between two planes. Let's use the above example. The tip of the rail is forward of the box. We need to move it back. [Reference this image]( URL_1 ) Add enough power to go a little bit faster than the other jet. Once the tip is about to touch the box, bring the power back JUST enough to stop the movement. If you've gone too far, you didn't catch it in time and need to add power to move the rail forward. Since you're never going to do it perfectly, the alignment will keep changing. With practice, you will only need little power movements to stop those alignment problems from getting too big. When the reference points on the aircraft are moving very slowly, you are almost perfectly matched in speed. Similar corrections can be done to fix up/down and left/right alignment using your stick and rudders.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 52.68, 'recall': 18.46, 'fmeasure': 27.34}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.35, 'recall': 2.57, 'fmeasure': 3.81}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.76, 'recall': 10.43, 'fmeasure': 15.44}}"
". For the ""Door to Hell"", if it's been burning so long, why hasn't a company/government taken advantage of it and use the heat as a source of energy or drill below to syphon the gas prior to ignition?",A company/government took advantage of it. The well was drilled in the 1970s to produce natural gas. It was capped in 1980 after it was discovered that the well was leaking methane. The well was capped because the gas was not worth extracting at the time.

There are plenty of sources of natural gas in the area that ARE NOT currently on fire. It's in the middle of a desert (The Karakum). There's no infrastructure there. A village is nearby, but it only has a few hundred inhabitants. Natural gas is typically collected and then transported to a place where it can be burned in a controlled and regulated environment (a power plant). This is done for safety and efficiency. It's better and easier to transport the natural gas than it is to transport electricity (across power lines). Building a power plant over top of the gas crater would be unsafe and inefficient. A few years ago the government of Turkmenistan said that the burning should be stopped because they want to exploit the natural gas and not have it just burning off into the atmosphere. But I don't know if anything has been done towards that end. The fuel it contains is on fire far beneath the ground, and impossible to extinguish, making it impossible to exploit for energy. For the same reason it would be too dangerous to construct anything around it to capture the heat. From an environmental perspective it's far better for the planet to have gas burning (turning into CO2 and H2O) than to vent all that methane into the air, since methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. Turkmenistan has a lot of gas that they are already harvesting and selling as much and fast as they can. It's not a particularly well-run country, so there's no rush with doing anything with problems that only exist outside the view of the president. They have made a few attempts at coming up with a plan for fixing the problem, but all theories seem to conclude that the gas will find its way up to the surface no matter what they do, so they might as well leave it in the known location, where it doesn't bother anyone directly. So, the short answer is that they don't do anything with it, because they don't have to. Besides, many Turkmen believe that it has already been dealt with. When I visited and later met locals in Ashgabat and told them I had been there, they were puzzled. Mainly because I had chosen to Turkmenistan voluntarily, but also because the local news a few months earlier had reported that the fire had been stopped thanks to heroic feats by Turkmen engineers ...","{'rouge1': {'precision': 34.0, 'recall': 11.72, 'fmeasure': 17.44}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.71, 'recall': 2.3, 'fmeasure': 3.43}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 22.0, 'recall': 7.59, 'fmeasure': 11.28}}"

","You're not wrong, things were built better. Your house cost ~$7,900 in 1930s money, or $115k after inflation in current currency. But things were built differently, we didn't have the mass production we do today, companies didn't have the capability to minimize their product to the minimum acceptable while marking up their consumer price to the maximum the market would stand. We didn't have a disposable economy where everything is expected to be shit and you just throw it away. I remember way back in high school taking a few years of CAD and architecture (I'm so glad I didn't pursue it further), and we learned quite a bit about minimizing materials. Back in the day, a 2x4 was a lot closer to it's rough cut dimensions. Now days, they're typically actually 1-1/2"" x 3-1/2"" or less. Engineers are hard at work determining just how little is actually necessary to frame an acceptably sturdy and load bearing wall. Joists used to be 14"" OC, now they're 16"". And this much I can say for sure: cookie cutter new construction houses, built as starter homes for first time buyers, are designed by people who had never given any thought to actually living in that house themselves. They're designed to be both easy and cheap to manufacture, fast to erect, and have sale appeal. The living spaces typically aren't actually usable, but the model homes are staged perfectly, because their layout was designed by the architect at the beginning. This is how we were taught to design a house. As late as the 70s, all houses had hardwood floors. It's what you did. And THEN, they would cover it in carpet, because carpet back in the day was a lavish extravagance. Now days, they put carpet right over the subfloor (admittedly, it makes the most sense). Beams are undersized. I remember this. Even my instructors said if they architected their own house, they would upscale the size of their main support beams and use older standards to over-specify the construction of their floors and footings. You know how to test you have a shithole constructed house? Walk across the room, does the china hutch rattle? On the other side of the house? This whole subject just makes me angry. I've been looking at some new construction that starts even above my price range, and I see a brand new house, not even a year old, with substantial sheer cracking in the foundation, enough that this brand new house will need to have the crack sealed at the very least, and likely the foundation cut and replaced in 10 years. Concrete cracks, yes, it's supposed to, foundations settle. But this is bullshit. If you want a quality house, you're going to spend a lot of money to get it, and it's difficult to evaluate contractors for suckage. ""Better is in the eye of the beholder"" Compare an American door latch to a German door latch if you'd like a real shock. German door and window hardware feels like it will be completely serviceable in 100 years. Frankly it looks a lot like the 100 year old stuff in the older part of town. Folks aren't heading out to the Home Depot every few years to get a new door latch. Making things plentiful at lower initial cost while ignoring the life cycle cost implications is a hallmark of US marketing. Your house also may contain lead paint, lead pipes, asbestos insulation, lead pipes, wiring that would make an electrician weep, no central a/c ducting, etc so ""quality"" is subjective. New construction may also use lighter composite materials that are engineered to be easier to work with and cheaper, so they may not be as long lasting, but the trade-off is cost may be worth it Easy answer...old was built to last but new was built to keep costs down. Cheap house, cheap material but expensive in todays dollars > everything feels...worse Totally subjective feeling. Lighter materials have their benefits, ""Cheaper"" options like laminate and cheap carpet aren't bad because who would want to finance fancy carpet for 30 years? Just upgrade the stuff you want. Some homes were built better back then, because the only people who could afford homes were more well off (pre-30 year mortgage), and because there was no minimum wage, lots of cheap immigrant labor. But there is also a confirmation bias at play... the only homes still standing 90 years later are the best built ones. For every well built, solid brick home from the 1920's there were also others that burned, fell apart, or were torn down for something more modern in its place. The pretense isn't really correct. Maybe new houses come with laminate floors, but they have better insulation, better framing, electrical systems, and such. When I worked for Hometime they remodeled a foursquare and found nice woodwork but shocking deficiencies in the framing. You can still commission a house with real wood floors and such if you want. In the old days cheaper finish materials weren't available and real wood and the labor to install them were cheaper. Oak is really expensive now, but it didn't used to be; my 1960s house has oak trim with cheap tile floors. In college I lived in a house that was built in the early 1900's (somewhere between the 20's and 40's in the Midwest). It is not that it was necessarily built better, but they did not have the same materials we have today. What you are seeing is known as survivor bias. Just like we say that ""Look at how all of these monuments/bridges/buildings lasts from the first millennium"", but you have no idea how many building were destroyed since then. By the 90's came around lots of construction developments have been made. One example is the pre-fabrication construction. Other things include door materials (the fiber board). Your friend probably got a base model house, while you got a house that, when it was new, was embellished. Houses now can be erected in a few weeks. Compared to a month or more of work. Each house will have their problems, but the older the house the more issues you are going to have with a variety problems. Cracking foundations, warping wood, and poor wiring are just a start. So your house will feel like it is more homely without as much furniture or decoration, but your friend's house will be more sound 'behind the scenes'. I do see homes with hardwood floors. Ours does, and it's not a high end home, but hardwood is popular in Boston suburbs. On the flip side, unless it's been upgraded or the builder was at the leading edge, that 1930s home probably has knob and tube wiring, or at most two wire wiring, with maybe one or two outlets per room, and a fuse box instead of circuit breakers, and maybe just 60 amp service. GFCI outlets would be an upgrade. The bathtub might not have had a shower originally. One thing people haven't mentioned is that labor was proportionately cheaper back then. Homes use sheetrock now because plaster skimcoats require more skill and labor. A good hardwood floor requires some expertise for the finish coat; laminate or prefinished hardwood is cheaper. This was a big deal when I was a volunteer firefighter in rural Ontario. The local area had a pretty big stretch from homes and shops built in the 30's and 40's, to new ones still going up. Partially it's the difference in the availability of materials and cost; such as readily available hardwood trees back in the day, that would be large and strong enough to span a roof, that just aren't around any more. I've seen center roof beams and floor joists that that are a single board, a foor thick in both directions. Modern construction replaced these with MDF board and manufactured wood I beams (think beaver puke). The other part is the engineering knowledge at the time. Back in the day, everything was over-engineered and oversized because the science and knowledge just wasn't there. Think about it the same way old cars and trucks were built, compared to modern ones. Bigger, heavier, more resources.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 8.26, 'recall': 6.05, 'fmeasure': 6.98}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.19, 'recall': 0.14, 'fmeasure': 0.16}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 7.78, 'recall': 5.7, 'fmeasure': 6.58}}"
Why is Gmail still not end to end encrypted,"
 The main reason is that Google would have to rebuild their entire infrastructure to support it. The way that Gmail works is that you send an email to Google’s servers and they store it on their servers. They then send the email to the recipient’s servers. The email is encrypted on your computer and then decrypted on the Google server. This is what makes it easy for you to use Gmail on your phone or other devices. However, it also makes it easy for Google to read your emails. This is why many people use end-to-end encryption. This is where the email is encrypted on your computer and then decrypted on the recipient’s computer. This makes it difficult for anyone to read the email. The problem is that it also makes it difficult for Google to deliver the email. It would be easy for Google to deliver the email if they could read it. However, they can’t read it if they use end-to-end encryption. They would have to use a different way to deliver the email. The only way that they could do this is by using a different infrastructure. This would require a complete overhaul of their infrastructure. It would be a very expensive and time-consuming process. I am sure that it would take years and billions of dollars to do.","Because it is email, and email cannot be end to end encrypted, without bringing in other technologies like PGP encryption. If you use HTTPS and/or SSL IMAP to access Gmail, the connection is ""end to end"" encrypted between the computer and the server. However the server can read the contents of your email because that is how the email system was designed. 1. GMail is an email provider, and has to work with other email providers. Even if they implemented end-to-end encryption, they couldn't use it with other providers unless those providers also used the same system. 2. GMail's servers read your email to see whether they are spam, and to target adverts at you, and to provide fast, high-quality search of your emails. All of these are impossible if GMail can't read the email because it's encrypted. 3. If GMail stored your mail encrypted, as well as being unable to search it, it would all be unreadable if you lost your private key, or if you moved to a computer where you didn't have access to it. Storing it in the cloud would require another layer of interoperability (you'd need a way to get the key into GMail), unless Google itself stored the key, in which case Google could also decrypt your emails. If GMail stored the email unencrypted, there would be no point. It's good to compare the service with WhatsApp. WhatsApp does everything through your phone. If your phone is off or without internet, it doesn't work anywhere. This means they can store your key on the phone and have it only decrypt stuff on the phone. Because it's their own protocol they can build the key management right into it and don't need to worry about some other service not supporting the way they do encryption. If it was end to end encrypted, either you'd have to manage the key yourself (and your email would all be lost if you lost the key) or the key would have to be stored on Gmail's servers encrypted with your password (and all of your email would be lost if you forgot your password- no such thing as a password reset for this). There is no way to make it ""just work"" with end-to-end encryption, and it turns out that ease of use and password resets are more important to more people than end-to-end encryption. If it was, Google wouldn't be able to read through it to help figure out what kind of ads to show you. That's the whole point of Gmail. There are several reasons. One huge one I haven't seen mentioned is spam. A big selling point of Gmail is their great spam prevention, which only works based on Google's ability to read emails en mass and get feedback (whether from automated AI data mining or manual user reports) about whether or not certain types of email are spam. If they couldn't access the plaintext of your emails, then spam prevention could only be done client side, which would be much less effective (less processing power, delays incoming mail, can't share results with other users as easily, etc). Encrypting e-mail is easy, addon like [enigmail]( URL_0 ) for thunderbird do the job. The problem is that nobody uses encryption. If I send an encrypted e-mail te Jeanne Doe, she needs to be able to read it. It's not that hard (2 Buttons in enigmail) but already to complex for the average mail user. The only encrypted e-mail I sent was something like ""*test post, do not answer*"" and the encrypted answer from my friend was ""*it's working*"" For Gmail the Gmail crypt plugin will do the trick, but again if none of your friend use it your screw. Your emails hosted on Gmail have to be able to send to other domains too, so none of those would be compatible. Likewise you receive emails from other domains, which also wouldn't be encrypted. This is as close to I have found to encrypted email: URL_0 When I got the account I was on a waiting list for over a year.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 75.76, 'recall': 24.44, 'fmeasure': 36.96}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.57, 'recall': 6.29, 'fmeasure': 9.52}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.87, 'recall': 9.64, 'fmeasure': 14.57}}"

It's not being powered, it's just a variation on a pendulum, and like a pendulum, it can only put out the energy that has been put into it, minus what it has lost from air resistance. Man some of these responses are way off base. First, there's nothing in physics that says you can't have a perpetual motion machine. You just can't extract any energy from it and have it move forever, because whatever you're using to create energy will add resistance to the system. A perfectly frictionless pendulum will have perpetual motion. You can also go into deep space and spin a drumstick like a rock star and that will spin forever (unless act on by another force of course). In your example, even if you ignore friction and air resistance, you wouldn't have perpetual motion. This is because of something called an eddy current. When you have a conductor moving through a magnetic field, a current develops that creates a magnetic field in the opposite direction of the existing field. The magnets in your example both create the magnetic field and act as conductors. Thus, as soon as you start spinning the magnet, the eddy current will create a magnetic field to counter that movement and stop the motion. Eddy current braking (as it's called) is used as a brake in electric motors, such as in your power drill. My guess for what would happen in your example is you give the magnet on a string an initial push, it stops almost immediately and bounces around on the string until finding its equilibrium in the repelling magnetic field. Are you a memeber of insane clown posse? You can create motion for a while, but you'll never be able to create more energy then it took to create the magnets. Eventually magnets lose their magnetism, even ""permanent"" magnets. It won't swing in circles. It will find the point where all the forces are cancelling eachother out and stop. But even if it would swing forever, you still won't get any energy from it as it will cause it to stop. The best case scenario is getting the same amount of energy back as you put in when you first set it in motion. There's nothing spectacular about making something go forever, just look at the planets orbiting the sun. But this doesn't mean that there's an infinite amout of energy to extract. Any energy you take out of the system will cause the objects to slow down. My past experience with eli5 has been pretty bad. Try asking r/science. That's what the mods here told me to do. Probably get more complete answers there. The magnet doesn't add any energy. Even in a frictionless vacuum, it keeps circling at the same speed, the same kinetic energy. You can't get energy from it without harvesting that kinetic energy, and you only have so much if it. The repulsion cannot be harnessed. Attempting to connect anything to the spinning magnet will cause it to stop because the repulsion is no longer strong enough to push both the magnet and your mechanism. There's a great [Captain Disillusion episode]( URL_0 ) on it feat. Beakman. The first two laws of thermodynamics; 1) Energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. 2) Entropy of any isolated system always increases. Magnets can not add energy to the movement for they have no energy of there own that is coming in. They are a constant force. In this system the friction of the pendulum will stop it and it will hit a point of equilibrium.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.77, 'recall': 16.8, 'fmeasure': 24.43}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.72, 'recall': 2.52, 'fmeasure': 3.66}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.13, 'recall': 11.3, 'fmeasure': 16.44}}"
what parts of subway tracks would kill me if I touched them?,"The rails themselves are not dangerous. The danger comes from the electrification of the trains. The electrification is a high voltage direct current. The voltage is usually around 750v DC, and the current is usually around 1000 amps. So if you were to touch the rail, the electrical current would be enough to cause death. The voltage is also high enough to cause electrocution. So if you were to touch the rail, you would get an electrical shock that would cause death. The train wheels also have a lot of force, and if you were to get hit by the train, you would be crushed.

How did the western world lay underwater telegraph lines as early as 19th century with their level of technology?,"Technically, they didn't. It was a bit of a scam. The first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1858 and failed. The second was laid in 1866 and failed. The third was laid in 1870 and failed. The fourth was laid in 1872 and worked. But it was not really a transatlantic telegraph cable. It was a cable between Ireland and Newfoundland. And it wasn't really a telegraph cable. It was a cable to transmit Morse code messages. The first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1866 and failed. It was laid again in 1870 and failed. The third cable was laid in 1872 and worked. But it was not really a transatlantic telegraph cable. It was a cable between Ireland and Newfoundland. And it wasn't really a telegraph cable. It was a cable to transmit Morse code messages. The first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1866 and failed. It was laid again in 1870 and failed. The third cable was laid in 1872 and worked.","The Victorians (as we call them this side of the pond) were actually pretty good at organising large scale engineering projects. These were the same people who built railways across the world too. Without underwater cables it would take weeks or months to have a decent international conversation so given the importance of a telegraph link, and the fact that the technology existed (The first telegraph was about 100 years earlier, and the first transatlantic ship was about 300 years before that), the rest was a question of will. They has steamships, and with big spools of cable they could lay underwater cables. Specialized ships even allowed cables to be retrieved and repaired. They basically did it the same way we do it today -- send out a ship with a huge amount of cable on a spool, and let it gradually play out and sink to the bottom. The main advantage we have today is the use of submarines so that maintenance can be carried out if necessary, but by-and-large once a cable's resting on the ocean floor nothing is going to disturb it anyway, so even without submarines they were able to run underwater cabling quite successfully. They'd already mastered telegraph lines on land, so what they needed for underwater cables was a way to waterproof them. Unlike today, when we have all kinds of artificial substances, they could only use natural ingredients. So one of the vitally important substances that allowed them to do this was gutta percha, which allowed them to waterproof the cables. It comes from a tropical tree. Once they learned this waterproofing technique, they used existing tech to lay the cables. It was dicey at first and there was a lot of trial and error. By the way, if you want to read about this in depth, Neal Stephenson wrote about the history of trans-oceanic cables in his book of essays, *Some Remarks*. It was very difficult but possible with the level of technology available in the 19th century. However, the potential payoff of linking continents by near instant communication was huge, big enough to prompt people to do it multiple times. The cables were similar to what is used today, a very thick armored sheath covering a few wires ( URL_2 ) (nowadays, fiber optic lines have replaced the signal lines). Massive reels of this cable were loaded on the biggest available ships and slowly laid down (an early steam powered cable laying vessel: URL_1 , and an illustration of one of the giant cable reels: URL_0 ). Cable breaks happened (as they do today). The earliest ocean cables were laid by sailing ships, but steam powered ships became common not long after. The break could be roughly located using the electrical ""echo"" that occurs when sending a signal down a long wire. A repair ship would sail out and dredge up the cable, where it would be repaired. The technology didn't come out of the blue. Long distance land telegraph lines were already common. There were some early underwater lines which ran for much shorter distances (like between England and France). This helped establish the basic technology before ocean crossings were attempted. There was no in-line repeater/amplifier technology at the beginning, so the extremely powerful signal sent on one end of the cable was extremely weak on the other end. There was no widespread electrical grid. The telegraph would be powered by large lead acid batteries. Because of the extremely long distance weak signal, non-standard equipment was used. A ""mirror galvinometer"" used a small mirror and magnet hanging from a string, which could be deflected by the tiny signal that made it through the cable to ""read"" the signal. Non-standard signals were used as well for several reasons: 1. Morse code was not yet the universal standard it became 2. Many cables linked to non-english speaking countries which didn't use Morse code anyway 3. The poor signal quality over the extremely long cables made other signal systems more attractive. The earliest cables could send only one signal at a time. Each end would have a schedule and would swap ""sending"" and ""receiving"" rolls at prearranged intervals. The code had to be sent slowly as well, since the signal was very weak. Given the very limited bandwidth, sending a trans-oceanic message was extremely expensive, writing a letter and sending it by ship was much more economical but far slower. Most signals would have been business or government messages as opposed to personal. Technological improvements gradually increased the capability of the trans-oceanic cables: 1. The invention of electrical amplifiers improved signal quality and the speed at which messages could be sent on a cable. 2. The invention of multiplex technology allowed one cable to send and receive at the same time instead of switching rolls. 3. Cable design improvements reduced breakages and allowed for more than one wire per cable. 4. Human operators initially did all sending and receiving. Eventually, mechanical punch card reader/writers replaced direct human signalmen and allowed for signal speed increases.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 62.35, 'recall': 12.41, 'fmeasure': 20.7}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.24, 'recall': 2.23, 'fmeasure': 3.72}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 36.47, 'recall': 7.26, 'fmeasure': 12.11}}"
"why sometimes when you put food in the microwave you hear lots of sparking sounds, then take it out, and your food is still cold/warm","The sparking you hear is caused by the water in the food heating up. The sparks are coming from the water, not the food itself. The sparks are caused by the water evaporating from the food, which causes the food to heat up. The food isn't actually cold, it's just that the sparks are so loud that it makes it seem that way.","Microwaves don't really heat food itself, they mostly heat the water *inside* food. But microwaves don't heat the water evenly. It gets heated in little sections, and those hot parts spread heat to all the cold ones. That takes time though. When food snaps but doesn't get hot its because the water in those hot parts started boiling (that's the sound) but it hasn't been long enough for the heat to spread out (that's why its cold). This is why packages say to let the food sit for a few minutes after cooking. Or you can run the microwave a few seconds on and a few seconds off to spread the cooking time out, which is the same exact thing the ""power"" setting will do. If the food has thin areas, they will heat faster and sizzle/pop before the thicker part is heated. You can either bunch the food together and use lower power level/longer time, or spread the food into an even thin layer and use high power. Stir halfway through and after heating to even out the temperature. Well according to [this]( URL_0 ) Popping or cracking noises can be caused by the following: • The food item you're cooking in the microwave. Dense foods or foods high in fat content can cause more noise. Covering foods and piercing the skin of potatoes and other vegetables will help reduce this. • Food spills can also cause popping noises. Clean up spills in the microwave as soon as they occur. • Operating the microwave empty can also cause popping and can damage the interior. Always have something in the microwave when you run it. • Using metal or metal-trimmed cooking utensils causes arcing in a microwave along with popping or crackling sounds. • If you are using the metal cooking rack, having the rack installed improperly can cause popping or crackling. Make sure the rack is firmly in place and not upside down. Microwaves do not heat food evenly [due to the presence of standing waves in the microwave]( URL_0 ). Certain sections of the microwave will get hotter than others, since the standing waves are, well, standing (i.e. they aren't moving). These hot areas can start boiling before the rest of your food is hot - especially if your food cannot dissipate the heat from these hot areas fast enough. This is one of the reasons why microwave food will oftentimes tell you to leave your food in the microwave for 1 minute after cooking is ""done"" - to allow the heat from the hot areas of the food to dissipate and even out. There are a lot of people in here explaining how microwaves work but in this case I think we maybe need to talk how microwaves fail. If the microwave is sparking and not heating you could have a blown out magnetron antenna. Sometimes the magnetron can fail in such a way that all of its energy runs straight to the chassis of the microwave like a lightning bolt. It makes a weird electric sound and the food heats very little or not at all. You likely need a repairman. Source: am repairman. This can happen if you put completely frozen foods in the microwave. The microwave works by rapidly alternating the orientation of water molecules and uses that friction to heat up your food. So if your food doesnt have a high water content (or all the water is completely solid), it won't heat up as well as it should. You can fix this by sprinkling some water on top, wrapping with a damp paper towel, or placing a small dish of water next to whatever you're heating up. So all of these responses are generally correct, but dont fully explain. Microwave Ovens use Microwaves to heat the food. Microwaves heat through radio waves, which pass through your food causing small particles to vibrate and heat. I believe most microwaves use a wide range of frequencies, so certain areas will be affected by multiple waves, some by none. Microwaves trust that they will heat enough areas that the heat will diffuse through conduction (heat transfer through a solid), but what you hear is the initial boiling of water or fat within the object on a very small scale. These tiny boiling areas serve to heat all of the cooler ones around it, but it also means microwaves can really destroy parts of your food (this is why microwaves tend to make meat tough and dry out your food). Microwaves don't heat food evenly. What your hearing is the food that is in your microwaves hotspot that have cooked. This is one of the reasons people aren't supposed to heat bottles in the microwave. The sounds is evaporating water that boils quicker than the fat and solids in the food itself. The way microwaves work also creates points of more intense heat where the waves used to cook amplify each other simular to how a ocean wave can make another wave bigger with the right timing. The sound you hear is similar to the sound firewood makes when being heated, before it actually burns, as the gasses in the wood evaporate and push out of the wood creating the odd hissing sounds. I ditched the microwave 5 years ago, never had once since. Its not because I worry about cancer or anything like that. I just genuinely think food out of a microwave tastes like complete shit. Only thing I miss it for is melting butter. It sounds like you put metal in the microwave. Either that or your microwave is just broken. It shouldn't be doing that. **Salt!** Something no one seems to have mentioned yet is salt. Along with metal, microwave energy can generate an electric charge in particularly salty spots within the food. When this charge arcs to an adjacent salty spot, or simply to the metal interior of the microwave, you hear a pop. Bonus Experiment: In a medicine cup, combine enough salt with water so as to make a paste. Consistency should be a bit goopy. Place the cup of salt paste in the center of the microwave, and cook for 10 mins on high. Patiently wait for the resulting light show. Well, is it frozen peas/carrots? Or a small amount of bacon? In that case the cause is: too little water, not enough microwave-absorption ...and this *converts your microwave into a Tesla Coil.* A nearly-empty microwave easily generates tens of thousands of RF volts (RF radio frequency.) This easily produces electric sparks between small food items. If sharp points are present (such as crusty charred bacon edges, or the pointy bits of frozen carrots,) it can even create blue-white flashes of corona discharge. If you don't like the visible flashes and cracking sounds, just add a small glass of water (or a large glass with an inch of water.) Now your microwave has something to absorb the waves. It will prevent the standing-wave from building up into ""Tesla Coil mode"" high voltage.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 89.23, 'recall': 4.88, 'fmeasure': 9.25}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 37.5, 'recall': 2.02, 'fmeasure': 3.83}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 61.54, 'recall': 3.36, 'fmeasure': 6.38}}"
How can bombs be unexploded?,"They don't. They're designed to detonate when they hit the ground. The ""unexploded"" bombs are actually just the bombs that didn't hit the ground. It's a very common misconception. This is because of the way they are made. They are made with a plastic explosive that is designed to be very hard to detonate. It requires a shockwave to detonate it. The bomb is designed to be very hard to detonate, so it will not explode until it is hit. This is why the bombs are so dangerous. They can be left unexploded for a long time. The reason they don't explode when they fall is because they are designed to be hard to detonate. They are designed to be hard to detonate so that they will not explode until they are hit. This is why they are so dangerous. They can be left unexploded for a long time.","WW2 bombs (like pretty much every bomb) require two parts - the ~~combustible~~ explosive material (what goes boom) and a fuse (what makes it go boom). The fuses were usually set based on the bombers height to make the bomb explode as close to the impact time as possible (so people couldn't run away). There are various ways that the fuses could be started - either when the bomb was dropped, when the bomb reached a certain speed (using fans in the nose) or trigger bombs (that would explode when contact was made) Sometimes these fuses would fail and the bomb would land but not explode. They can still be incredibly dangerous because the explosives in them are still active and if exposed to anything that would cause them to ignite will explode. The old trigger bombs are (obviously) the most dangerous because all they need is for somebody to hit the trigger (assuming it hasn't rusted over) and they can explode. As a further twist to fuse failure as already discussed, it was discovered during the Spanish civil war (pre-WWII) that bombs that did not explode due to fuse failure caused more disruption than the ones that did explode -- the area around the bomb would have to be evacuated until the bomb was rendered safe. The Germans then started installing fuses that had a long delay-time, hours or days even, to cause this sort of problem. An entire military specialty, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), was devoted to finding and de-fusing these bombs. Twist number two is that the Germans then engineered fuses that were specifically designed (booby-trapped) to explode and kill the EOD officer trying to de-fuse it. There is an excellent British mini-series about this WWII experience, DANGER UXB. Highly recommended. A movie on the same subject in the modern era is THE HURT LOCKER. [EDIT: spelling] Sometimes the mechanism just fails and there is no explosion, it's still dangerous because if the contents ignite the bomb will still explode.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 52.6, 'recall': 23.89, 'fmeasure': 32.86}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.84, 'recall': 3.55, 'fmeasure': 4.89}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 22.73, 'recall': 10.32, 'fmeasure': 14.2}}"
"Why, if petrol is more volatile and burns hotter and faster, are diesel engines more efficient in engines of the same size?","It is not actually more volatile, it is actually less volatile. Diesel is more dense and therefore burns at a lower temperature. Diesel engines are more efficient because they are heavier and use less air. They also have a more efficient combustion chamber design. Diesel fuel is actually less volatile than gasoline. Diesel fuel is less volatile than gasoline because it has a higher carbon number. This means that the molecules in diesel fuel are heavier and burn more slowly, which is what makes diesel engines more efficient. Diesel engines are also heavier than gasoline engines, which means that they have more mass, which means that they have more inertia, which means that they can maintain their speed better, which means that they can maintain their speed better at lower engine speeds, which means that they can maintain their speed better when accelerating.   they have a more efficient combustion chamber design.   they are better at maintaining their speed.   they are better at maintaining their speed.   they are better at maintaining their speed.   they are better at maintaining their speed.   they are better at maintaining their speed.  ","As said before diesel fuel has more energy per volume, but that's not the whole story. The 'burn' in a diesel is more powerful not only because of the fuel type, but also because the compression ratio of a diesel engine is much higher than a gas engine on average. It's so high that a diesel engine does not use spark plugs to ignite the fuel mixture, the burn happens from the force of compression alone (except in startup situations and/or if you have a tricked engine management system where the 'glow plugs' are activated to aid the combustion process). Higher compression ratio typically gives you an increased volumetric efficiency and ergo yields more power output. Now all that said, these new direct injection gas engines are getting up there with relatively high c:r, but still not quite near a diesel yet. Diesel fuel contains more energy per unit volume than does gasoline.

How does a fire cause a interstate highway to fall,"( URL_0 ) > The fire weakened the structural steel and caused the concrete to crack. The fire caused the steel to weaken, which caused the concrete to crack. The concrete is now exposed to the elements, and the salt used on the road during the winter months is eating away at the concrete. The fire weakened the steel, which weakened the concrete. The salt used on the road during the winter months is eating away at the concrete.","The portion of the interstate that collapsed is made from precast concrete beams. A bunch of steel reinforcement bars (rebar) are shaped and welded into a beam and it's placed into a mold into which they pour the concrete. Those beams are then placed between structural supports and metal decking is placed between them. The concrete roadway or road bed is then poured on top of the metal decking. This is all made of material that contracts and expands with heat so at both ends there are expansion joints. In this case it's just a giant compressible rubber gasket that's about 4"" wide. Concrete is extremely strong when undergoing compressive forces but not so great when it's under a flexion load. The beams are cast in an arch so that when they are loaded(heavy stuff on top), the concrete is under a compressive load. The fire burned under the entire bridge and was hot enough to weaken the rebar. Think about the bridge like a long board that's supported by two chairs; one on either end. The roadway on top of the beams is ""really heavy"" and the weight is mostly evenly distributed among them. The weakened rebar caused the arch shape in the beams to deform enough to where the load on the concrete moved from compression to flexion. In the board analogy if you put enough weight on the middle of the board it'd sag. Keep adding weight and it'd deform enough to where the ends would slip off of the chairs. TL;DR The fire did NOT melt the steel; it just got it warm enough to where it was bendable.

Would a refrigerator act like a heater if placed outside in subzero temperatures?," In short, yes. It would. The thing to remember is that a refrigerator is a heat pump, and it's designed to take heat from inside and transfer it outside. If you put a refrigerator outside in subzero temperatures, it would transfer the heat from inside to outside, causing the inside to get colder. If you put it inside a building in subzero temperatures, it would transfer the heat from outside to inside, causing the inside to get warmer.","A refrigerator would NOT act as a heater in sub-zero temperatures, it would simply turn off. The refrigerator has temperature sensors inside that turn it on and off based on the temperature inside, and normally what happens is the heat from outside seeps into the refrigerator, making it hot, and activating the temperature sensor. If it's cold outside, then the heat inside the refrigerator will seep out, and the refrigerator contents would get cold. Temperature sensor would detect this and turn off the refrigerator to conserve energy. In addition, the refrigerator transports the heat using a gas that turns to liquid at a certain temperature; because of the cold outside, this gas would stay liquid or even possibly freeze, and the refrigerator wouldn't function properly. For Antarctica, if they need a refrigerator inside a (normally warm) kitchen, they probably use a regular refrigerator. They're designed to work in normal temperatures that you find indoors. Or, they could have some outside storage sheds that would be very cold because of the environment, and thus use no electricity to freeze meat or whatever. Any sort of heat exchange machine always outputs a net surplus of heat because they consume energy to operate. A refrigerator operated in any environment will output heat. Refrigerators are not usually designed to work in places such as Antarctica because all the need is that the heat exchange coils on the outside of the refrigerator are warmer than the surrounding environment. It being too cold outside isn't really a problem in any way. Furthermore most consumer refrigerators dump heat from inside themselves into the room in which they reside. Even if in Antarctica if the room is a similar temperature to normal then the refrigerator doesn't care at all what the outside temperature is. Finally if it is super cold outside all the time people don't care about refrigerators, they just put things they want kept cold outside. Cooling things down isn't a problem when there is ice everywhere.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 74.68, 'recall': 17.4, 'fmeasure': 28.23}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 20.51, 'recall': 4.73, 'fmeasure': 7.69}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 41.77, 'recall': 9.73, 'fmeasure': 15.79}}"
Why do guns recoil up instead of down?,"Because when you pull the trigger, the spring inside the gun is compressed, and when it's released, it pushes the bullet out of the barrel. This is what gives you the recoil. When the bullet leaves the barrel, the spring is released again, and this is what gives you the recoil back. So the recoil is caused by the spring inside the gun, not the bullet. It's a bit like when you push a car, the car will push back. The bullet is the car, and the spring is the pushing force.","The axis of the cartridge lies above the fulcum created by the shooter's hand, so the recoil acts to torque the firearm muzzle up. principles of the lever. the force in a standard firearm is backwards at the chamber. this position is forward and above the fulcrum, usually the shooter's wrist. this is true for a normal handgun. weapons that do not have the chamber above the fulcrum will not exhibit this behavior much. a shouldered AR15 will rise much less. the chamber is basically directly forward of the fulcrum (the buttstock). however it's still the top half of the buttstock that unevenly absorb the recoil. It has to do with the shape of the gun and the way it is held. The action takes place in the upper portion of the weapon, and the hands are around the grip which is pointing downwards. If you were to fire the gun upside down, it would recoil down. The location of the barrel at the top of the gun, above where the shooter is gripping the firearm. If the barrel was on the bottom, the gun would recoil downward. The Mateba unica 6 and Chiappa Rhino revolvers have barrels that align with the bottom of the cylinder instead of the top. This directs more of the force backwards into the shooters hand and reduces recoil- induced muzzle flip. ELI5 explanation. The barrel is above your hand. Try holding a toy pistol (or a banana, or anything else pistol shaped) in one hand. Then, put a finger on the ""muzzle"" and push back. It will try to rotate upwards, because your grip is under the point you push at. That is why many modern rifles have the stock extending backwards exactly along the length of the barrel. The force of the recoil will then go straight back against the stock.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.7, 'recall': 18.65, 'fmeasure': 28.64}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.2, 'recall': 5.16, 'fmeasure': 7.94}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 40.43, 'recall': 12.22, 'fmeasure': 18.77}}"
how come microwaves only heat the water in foods and not the food itself?,"Microwaves don't penetrate through the food, they just bounce off the water. Water has a high dielectric constant, which means it is very good at absorbing microwaves. The dielectric constant of water is about 80, while the dielectric constant of fat is about 2.3. That means that water can absorb 80 times more microwaves than fat. That's why microwaves can heat water, but not fat.","They don't strictly speaking heat ""water in foods and not the food itself"". /u/jaa101 touched on this in his response - microwaves aren't tuned specifically to water. Microwaves work by creating oscillating waves which induce movement in polar molecules, which isn't an ELI5 answer, so stick with me. A polar molecule is one where the overall charge is not fully balanced and there is a slight variance in the charge on different sides of the molecule. Here's a quick text-drawing of a water molecule to demonstrate: H H \ / O The bond between the H and the O has a positive and a negative end - the H ""side"" is positive and the O side is ""negative"", and because of the arrangement of the atoms in the molecule, the side with O on it has a bit of a negative charge and the side with the H has a bit of a positive charge. We know that opposite charges attract, so if you can induce a negative charge on the bottom of that drawing, the O atom is repelled and the H atoms are attracted, so the molecule rotates and becomes: O / \ H H If you keep the source of charge oscillating (so that the source of negative charge changes position around the molecule), the molecule will spin. The spinning molecules will bump into other molecules which passes the energy from the spin onto them - and this energy is observed as heat. The fact that this works on water shouldn't be mistaken for only water being heated - fats, sugars and other molecules can also be heated. The key bit is that to be heated, the molecule needs to be polar.

Manual Cars,"Manual cars have a clutch pedal that you press down to disengage the engine from the transmission. The car then shifts into neutral and the driver has to shift gears manually using a shifter. Automatic cars have a torque converter that automatically engages the engine and transmission and shifts gears for you. There are some manual cars that are called ""semi-automatic"" or ""clutchless"" which use a computerized system that allows you to shift gears without using the clutch pedal.","The rotation of the motor must be transmitted to the rotation of the wheels. What the clutch does is connect the rotation of the engine with the rotation of the wheels. Inside the car you have several gears with dog teeth connected to one another [like this]( URL_0 ). The engine is rotating, makes the green (and inevitably the red and the blue) turn. But the blue are turning blind, they are not connected to the yellow rod. If your engine is off and you're rolling downhill, the yellow rod rotates, but all the gears are still. The yellow rod is only connected to the purple and it's what makes the wheels of your car turn. With the clutch and the knob you can move the purple and attach it to whatever you need. When the purple is attached, you have a direct connection between the engine and the yellow rod (and eventually, the wheels).

How does data recovery from formatted SD cards work?,"Data recovery is the process of retrieving data from a storage device that has been damaged, either physically or logically. Data recovery from a formatted SD card is a bit different than from a hard drive. Hard drives are essentially just a bunch of magnets that are arranged in a particular pattern. When a hard drive is formatted, the operating system is essentially just telling the hard drive what to do. For example, it might tell the hard drive to erase all of the data on the disk and replace it with a file system. The data is still there, but the operating system is telling the hard drive to treat it like it's gone. With an SD card, it's a bit different. SD cards are essentially just a bunch of flash memory. When you format an SD card, the operating system is essentially just telling the SD card to erase all of the data on the disk and replace it with a file system. This is a bit different than a hard drive, because the data is stored in the form of electrons in a flash memory chip. When you format an SD card, the electrons are erased, but they're still there. The data is still there, but the operating system is telling the SD card to treat it like it's gone. There are a few different ways to recover data from a formatted SD card. One way is to use a recovery software program.  ","The difference between an 8GB card vs a 7GB card has to do with how cards are marketed vs how computers count data. It's kind of fucked up that it's allowed, but it's the way all data storage is sold. A card retailed for 8gb contains 8,000,000,000 bytes. Except computers don't count in base 10, they count in base 8. So 8 GB in computer talk is 8,589,934,592 bytes. This is stupid, but it's the way storage has been sold since forever, so that's just the way it is. 8,000,000,000 bytes is around 7.4 gigabytes. You might also lose a little because there's some overhead. So that takes care of your missing space. The recoverable data is not in that space. So the way computers store files are in 1 looooooong string is 1's and 0s. The computer then makes an index that says FileX starts at position 362 and runs to 492. So it makes note of where it stores the file, what storage positions the file occupies. So when you delete a file, all that happens is it removes that file from the index and notes those areas as ""available"". It does NOT actually go back and change the 1 or 0s to some other value. It just kind of abandoned the file and notes the area as empty when it's really not. When you want to store a file in that so-called ""empty"" space the computer just over rights whatever is there with the new data and makes a note in the index. File recovery ignores the index and goes directly to where the storage is, it looks at all the 1s and 0s and try's to identify what is actually stored there, as opposed to what the file index table says is there. So if the table says positions 1 to 10 are empty, the recovery program looks at 1 to 10 and finds that there's actually a picture stored in 7 & 8, 1-4 are a video. 5 & 6 are part of a video and 8 & 9 are part of a picture.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 49.6, 'recall': 33.6, 'fmeasure': 40.06}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.02, 'recall': 4.08, 'fmeasure': 4.86}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.6, 'recall': 14.63, 'fmeasure': 17.45}}"

For the love of Graham Bell! Why have cell phone manufacturers not devised a way for a camera to shoot in landscape mode while the phone is vertical?, Pixel 3 XL vertical camera shot.  ,"Software solutions exist for this (see the [Horizon]( URL_1 ) app), but the vertical vs horizontal problem is a hardware constraint that can only be partially solved by software. Just like film in a camera, the sensor that is used to capture an image is _physically_ a rectangle. For usability, purposes the manufacturers align the rectangular shape of the sensor to the rectangular shape of the phone. I.e. the long axis of the physical sensor is parallel to the long axis of the phone. EDIT: I can't stress the usability issue enough. Having the long axis of the phone parallel to the long axis of the handset means the orientation of the phone _represents_ the orientation of the sensor (and thus the photo). If the long axis of the phone were perpendicular to the long axis of the sensor, that would increase the cognitive load on the user. That means, in a phone that is held vertically (the long axis *of the phone* on the vertical), there are **only three solutions** to taking a photo with the long axis *of the sensor* oriented horizontally: 1. Manually turn the phone 90 degrees. Duh. 2. Leave the phone oriented how it is and mechanically turn the sensor without the phone being moved. This is certainly mechanically possible, but would require additional components and a tiny motor to rotate the sensor inside of the phone before the photo is taken, either automatically or on demand. This doesn't happen because the value of doing this (over #1 above) isn't worth all the extra space in the phone this kind of physical mechanism would take up. 3. A software based solution, like the aforementioned Horizon app, which uses the phones' accelerometer to determine tilt and adjust _which_ pixels on the sensor are being used to capture the photo. The downside to this approach is when the phone is held vertically (long axis of the phone on the vertical), the long axis of the photo sensor is still on vertical. The way the software gets a photo with an aspect ratio with the long axis of the photo on the horizontal is to ignore large portions of the sensor data. So when you're holding the phone vertically (or on an angle), an app like Horizon is only using a sliver of the middle section of the sensor to maintain the aspect ratio and orientation, and throwing away the rest of the sensor data. So you're giving up picture resolution and detail in favor of maintaining orientation. EDIT: [this demo of Horizon]( URL_0 ) makes it clear what data is being left out. It's not that far out there, but as someone mentioned, the sensor is an issue. Sensors are rectangular, not square (assuming they are doing what most cameras do). So to shoot landscape while holding portrait, you'd need a bigger sensor. Then you'd need UI controls to determine when you wanted to do this, because sometimes you might want to shoot portrait, so it couldn't be an ""all the time"" situation.

Each trade can have their own foreman, or their can be a single supervisor for the entire construction crew. This work site can have various inspectors for each trade, inspectors for the local city, reps for other utilities, and civil engineers can all appear on this site. These workers do all the paperwork, record keeping, and assume the liability for this job. Even though there are a dozen or more people on site, only three have shovels. Everyone is working hard at their own speciality. At any instant there are more people employed to ensure the smooth workflow of the repair and protect the lives of everyone involved, then getting sweaty and getting their hands dirty.

Why are semi's not more streamlined?," Sleeker is better in a streamlined vehicle, and the aerodynamic benefits of a streamlined vehicle are well known. However, a semi is not a streamlined vehicle. The aerodynamic benefits of a streamlined vehicle are achieved by reducing drag. Drag is caused by air flowing over the vehicle, and the faster the vehicle goes, the more drag there is. In a streamlined vehicle, the air flows smoothly over the vehicle, creating less drag. In a semi, the air flows over the front of the trailer and the sides of the trailer, and it flows under the trailer. The air flowing under the trailer creates a lot of drag, which is why the drag on a semi is so much higher than the drag on a streamlined vehicle. The trailer is not streamlined, and the aerodynamic benefits of a streamlined vehicle are lost.

Some companies even put fins on the bottom and back of the trailers to disrupt vortex formation and lower drag. Trucks that do more local hauling don't usually go fast enough to warrant any aerodynamic improvement, so other concerns like cost, maintenance accessibility, and length determine the shape. I'll add that the tractors in Europe are boxy (flat in front, with the cabin above the motor, not behind like the typical American truck) because of length restrictions covering the whole vehicle, instead of only the trailer. They are designing more aerodynamic truck portions, but the trailer portion will be either box or open topped due to the nature of the semi trucking industry. Boxes allow for stacking and easily standardized sizes, as well as maximized carrying capacity per space allowed. That would be my guess anyway.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 20.61, 'recall': 27.01, 'fmeasure': 23.38}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.2, 'recall': 2.89, 'fmeasure': 2.5}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.35, 'recall': 20.11, 'fmeasure': 17.41}}"
"What's the difference between a well optimized computer program, and one that's not well optimized?"," ""Optimization"" is the process of finding the best possible way to do something. In computer science, this usually means finding the fastest possible way to do something. There are many different ways to do something, and each way has its own advantages and disadvantages. The best way to do something is usually the one that balances speed with other factors such as memory usage, safety, and usability. For example, a program that's optimized for speed might use a lot of memory and be difficult to use, or it might be less safe because it doesn't check for errors as much. There are many different factors that can be optimized for. For example, you might want to optimize for speed, memory usage, safety, or usability. It's possible to optimize for all of these factors at once, but it's usually easier to choose one or two to optimize for. There are many different ways to optimize for these factors, and the best way to do it depends on the specific program you're working on. There are many different tools you can use to optimize a program. Some of the most common ones are compilers, profilers, and debuggers. Compilers take your program and translate it into machine code. This process is usually done automatically by the computer's operating system, but you can also do it yourself by hand. Profilers take your program and measure how much time it takes to run.  ","Pass by reference vs. pass by value is one of the many optimizations that people consider when looking to improve performance when using C variants where this functionality is exposed. In other, higher level languages, this functionality is performed by the compiler and therefore isn't exposed. Instead, when people discuss optimization they are usually referring to how a task is being done and whether it makes sense. Loops are expensive, especially over large data sets so a lot of optimization revolves are minimizing the number of times you have to perform that loop or figuring out a way to segment the data so that each loop is smaller. Optimization may refer to how data is organized either in memory or in the database to limit the amount of information that needs to be passed around or worked on.' And then there is really low level optimization where you may opt to implement a piece of functionality in software on a FPGA or custom built chip instead of in software on commodity hardware. It all depends on what level you're working at and what your most expensive operations are.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 29.1, 'recall': 37.37, 'fmeasure': 32.72}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.29, 'recall': 4.23, 'fmeasure': 3.7}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.93, 'recall': 17.89, 'fmeasure': 15.67}}"
What goes on mechanically in a speaker when you turn down the volume of music?,"A speaker is essentially a diaphragm that is suspended by a coil of wire. When the coil is energized by the electrical signal, the magnetic field that it creates causes the diaphragm to move. When you turn down the volume, the magnetic field is weaker, so the diaphragm moves less. The speaker is essentially a coil of wire with a magnet attached to it. When you apply an electrical signal, the coil of wire creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field interacts with the magnet and the speaker cone (the part that moves back and forth) and causes it to move. The amount of movement is determined by the strength of the magnetic field. When you turn down the volume, the electrical signal is reduced, which reduces the strength of the magnetic field. As a result, the speaker cone moves less.","A speaker pretty much consists of a cone, an electromagnet, and a permanent magnet. You can see the cone, usually, although sometimes it's covered in fabric or metal mesh. To produce music, an electronic signal is sent to the electromagnet, telling it what direction to produce an electric field. So it either moves closer to the permanent magnet, or it moves farther away, and this causes the cone to vibrate. As the cone vibrates, it causes vibrations in the air around the cone - and that's how sound travels. Sound is just vibrations in the air. The frequency of the vibrations (how fast the cone is wiggling back and forth) dictates the pitch - higher frequency, higher pitch. When you turn the volume down, the electromagnet is still causing the cone to wiggle, but it causes it to wiggle less. The amplitude of the wiggling goes down when you turn the volume down. So the sound isn't as loud, but it's still the same pitch. If you have the kind of speaker where you can see the cone, and you turn it up really loud, you can actually see the cone moving.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 50.35, 'recall': 36.6, 'fmeasure': 42.39}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.86, 'recall': 9.33, 'fmeasure': 10.81}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.08, 'recall': 21.13, 'fmeasure': 24.48}}"
"Razors - why does the little blue lube bar come after the blades? It goes squeegee, blades, lube strip, instead of the opposite - why?",Because that's the way it was invented. The first razor was invented by King Cyrus in the 6th century BC. It was made of copper and had two blades. The first blade was the one that was used to cut the hair and the second blade was used to clean the blade. The blade was made of a type of metal that was very hard and could be sharpened easily. The lube bar was not invented until the 19th century and it was made of a type of rubber that was soft and easy to mold into a bar shape. The first razor that was invented with a lube bar was the safety razor. The safety razor was invented in the 1870s. It was invented by King Cyrus II and it was made of a type of metal that was very hard and could be sharpened easily. The safety razor was invented because the first razors were very dangerous. They had very sharp blades and they were very hard to sharpen. The safety razor was invented because it was safer.  pened easily.

The moisturizer bar comes afterwards to help re-moisturize once the blades clear away the cream/soap. Edit: The squeegee thing is actually called a guard bar and prepares the skin for shaving by smoothing it and making it taut. According to this [Gillette video]( URL_0 ) the average guy takes 170 strokes or more to properly shave. From my experience, the reality is that you never get a clean shave in a series of single passes no matter what blade you use. In my case it takes multiple passes in different directions to get what I consider a clean shave. The first pass removes the shaving cream and some of the hairs and the lubricating strip ensures that the next pass glides smoothly. It also may have some impact on the angle of the cutting action. Then consider that as the lubricant wears off the angle changes and the razor may not cut as well over time as the angles gets ever more flatter. How hard you press the razor into your skin may also affect the angle and at what angle you hold the blade may impact its effectiveness if the lubricating strip acts as a fulcrum to lift the blades away from the skin surface.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 32.29, 'recall': 25.31, 'fmeasure': 28.38}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.57, 'recall': 1.23, 'fmeasure': 1.38}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.71, 'recall': 13.88, 'fmeasure': 15.56}}"
Why do we drive using our right foot for both the accelerator and brake instead of using our left foot for the brake?,"> why is the brake pedal on the right side of the car and not the left?

Because the left side of the car is the driver's side. It's easier to use the pedals with your feet, so the driver's side is the side that has the pedals. It's also easier to reach the pedals with your left foot than your right foot, so that's why they are placed there.","You are taught to use the right foot for gas and brake for two reasons: 1) If you drive a car with a manual transmission, you need your left foot for the clutch, because you have to clutch and brake at the same time to avoid stalling the engine, and you always either have to have the clutch engaged or the gas pedal down when the car is running (or else you stall the engine). So you need a clutch food, and a gas/brake foot. 2) Even if you drive an automatic, if you use two feet, you might accidentally panic and put your brake foot down before you take your gas foot off. It's bad for your car to have the brakes on while the gas is on. Damages your engine. By using one foot, you can't ""ride the brakes"". This bad behavior comes when resting the foot on the brake pedal engages them just a little bit all the time. It makes your engine work harder and your brakes very hot. They wear out faster and hot brakes have a much larger stopping distance in an emergence. Simply training drivers to use the same foot to hold down the accelerator and press the brake pedal keeps them from doing both at the same time. You might need the left foot to press the clutch, but that's not the reason for using the right on the other two. Are you talking about an automatic or a manual? in England we drive mainly manual (stick) transmissions, which requires our left foot to operate the clutch. The fact that automatic drivers use their right for both is a holdover from when automatic didnt exist. It also encourages the good practise of having brake OR accelerator, but not both at once. because of manual transmissions. your left foot had to operate the clutch, leaving the right for gas and brake. enter automatics, and the right foot still does double duty and the left foot goes on vacation. Of not race drivers (eepecially in cars with paddle shift) do exactly this to avoid transition time and let them do some advanced techniques in specific circumstances where you might want to use both at the same time. For road users its not recommended. The threads gone into why already. Probably a few reasons: You should not use both the break and accelerator at the same time- using the same foot for both prevents this. Cars with manual transmissions require a separate foot to operate the clutch since it is frequently used at the same time as the brakes or accelerator. Wouldn't make sense to learn to use the left foot for brakes if automatic but right for manual transmission.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 70.27, 'recall': 11.3, 'fmeasure': 19.48}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 21.92, 'recall': 3.49, 'fmeasure': 6.02}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.19, 'recall': 6.3, 'fmeasure': 10.86}}"
why is the gas tank at the rear of the car(for most cars) if gas needs to get to the engine?,"The gas tank is at the rear of the car because it's easier to store it there.

If you put it in the front, you would have to make sure that the front of the car isn't too heavy, and that would make the car harder to steer. The car needs to be able to move forward and backward, so the gas tank is at the back. It's easier to store it there.","Just a few thoughts but 1. It's safer; A vehicle fire is likely to break out at the front of the vehicle so the farther away the gas tank the better. 2. There's no room; There are a lot of things that HAVE to be in the engine compartment or the front of the vehicle leaving little wiggle room for something as massive as a 15 gallon tank 3. Balance (this is probably more unintentional than anything else). The more unbalanced a car is the more likely it will be tail happy, so adding a bunch of weight to the rear never hurts 4. Ethanol, a component in a lot of different gas products, evaporates, so the cooler (farther from the engine) the better Engines get hot, as does the area around the engine.

Are diesel cars better or worse for the environment than petrol cars?," Cars produce emissions that damage the environment. In the UK, the majority of cars emit harmful gases into the atmosphere. These gases are known as greenhouse gases and are a major contributor to climate change. Cars produce emissions that damage the environment. In the UK, the majority of cars emit harmful gases into the atmosphere. These gases are known as greenhouse gases and are a major contributor to climate change. Cars are not the only source of greenhouse gases, but they are a significant one. In fact, cars produce more greenhouse gases than any other source of pollution in the UK. The main greenhouse gases produced by cars are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases are responsible for the majority of the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon whereby the Earth traps heat in the atmosphere. However, as a result of human activities, the greenhouse effect has become stronger, leading to climate change. Climate change is a major threat to the environment and human health. It can lead to changes in weather patterns, more frequent natural disasters, and changes in the distribution of plants and animals. The greenhouse gases produced by cars are emitted into the atmosphere through the exhaust of the engine.  ","It is an ongoing debate whether diesel or gasoline causes more pollution. Diesels often seem to cause more pollution, as they release more of the visible pollutants, like NOx and soot. However, they release fewer hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, things you can't see as easily. They also don't release lead, which is less of concern in places that mandate unleaded gasoline. It depends on what you're looking at. If you're just taking the engine into account, and nothing else, Diesels are considerably cleaner. Spark Ignition vehicles typically operate in such a way that they have an immense amount of partial combustion, which produces all sorts of hydrocarbon compounds (which are typically both bad for you *and* the environment), as well as carbon monoxide. Diesels, on the other hand, generally burn pretty cleanly, because they generally operate with spare oxygen in the cylinder (if they're not, you're literally shoving fuel out of the exhaust). **However**, there are two major caveats. First, it's actually surprisingly easy to clean the exhaust from Spark Ignition engines. We use catalytic materials to actually promote this cleaning process, and those catalytic materials generally perform better when they have all sorts of chemical species to work with (particularly, hydrocarbons). Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal until we get to the second problem. Diesels have what is called the NOx-PM tradeoff, whereby every diesel will either make particulate matter (PM), which is basically just fuel droplets that didn't burn completely and are shoved out the exhaust, or oxides of nitrogen (which are, collectively, NOx), which are some of the worst compound to come out of your engine that aren't the hilariously bad things like BTEX compounds. The tradeoff exists because you can't really run the engine without producing one or the other without getting into particularly interesting engine cycles that are kind of difficult to control. PM we can sort of deal with, but you generally don't want to be making PM (as you're literally just shoving fuel, and therefore money, out the tailpipe), so we generally end up making NOx instead. The big issue with this is that NOx is **really** hard to clean up in diesels. There are various convoluted methods to do so (the gold-standard of which is Selective Catalytic Reduction, or SCR, which typically requires urea injection). Note that Spark Ignition engines will *also* produce NOx, but the same dirty exhaust helps in cleaning that NOx out through normal catalysis. In diesels, the exhaust is extremely clean already, so we can't take that path. So, as for which one is better...Diesels. Diesels are far more efficient, in that you'll get more energy per liter of greenhouse gases emitted by the engine, but they make NOx and PM. Both NOx and PM can be cleaned, but that makes the engine more expensive upfront, and can eat into the cost savings from having lower fuel consumption. If you're okay with the added costs, then diesels are considerably cleaner. FWIW, what VW did was try to use the tests to justify their deletion of their SCR systems, which costed a significant amount of money, and thus forced them to raise the prices, which in turn hurt sales. The specifics of how they did their cheat are actually hilariously easy to pull off, such that I wouldn't be surprised at all if most of the other diesel manufacturers in the US and the EU hadn't at least considered attempting it.

As the wheel spins, the needle points towards the center of the wheel. The angle between the needle and the center of the wheel is the angle of the wheel. The angle of the wheel is proportional to the angle of the object being measured. For example, if the wheel is spinning and the needle points to the center of the wheel, the angle between the needle and the center of the wheel is 90 degrees.

How do civil engineers ensure the on-ramps and overpasses supported by manmade dirt slopes never collapse?,"I'm a civil engineer. The way it works is that the engineers design the slope with the appropriate angle to prevent collapse. The slope is then built using compacted dirt and gravel. If you are in an area where this is happening, you might notice that they first dig a trench and then fill it with gravel. The gravel is compacted down to a solid layer, and then the dirt is placed on top of the gravel. The dirt is then compacted down to a solid layer. This is repeated until the desired height is reached. Once the height is reached, the engineers check the stability of the slope to ensure that it is safe. They do this by measuring the angle of the slope and checking the weight of the dirt. If the angle is too steep, the engineers will add more dirt to the top of the slope. If the weight is too high, they will remove some of the dirt from the bottom of the slope. The engineers will continue to add or remove dirt until the slope is stable.","A pile of granular materials has a property known as ""angle of repose"" which is the angle the side slopes of a pile of that material spills to when left alone. Embankment sideslopes are designed at an angle less than this angle of repose to keep the sideslopes stable. Secondly, the material is compressed, this tends to lock the edges of the grains together and it also tends to remove voids. Remove the voids prevents water from running between grains which could destabilise them. Compacted earth is often also vibrated as it compacted so that the grains move around and fit together better - as an experiment, try gently shaking a coffee jar, and you'll see the level of the coffee drop as the grains fit together better. They are not generally supported by dirt slopes. They are supported by concrete and steel pillars that go down into the ground all the way to bedrock.

Another issue is the potential for a derailment, which will be addressed with the same design principles as a regular train.  ","It doesn't. The hyperloop test track is about a quarter mile and about 4.5 feet in diameter, and by volume is the second largest vacuum chamber on Earth. There's a shit ton of energy in a vacuum, as the test track has ~14.6 psi on it which is nothing to scoff at when you have ~19,000 sq.ft (Edit: 2,736,000 URL_0 , to keep consistent with the units - that's 39,945,600 lbs of pressure on the vessel) of surface area. Any falter in the structural integrity anywhere will cause a cascade implosion failure along it's entire length until the vessel ruptures and vacuum is lost. The thing is wildly dangerous just to stand next to it. (Edit 2: rapid loss of vacuum is about as deadly and destructive as the implosion itself.) But of course they said it's only a partial vacuum, but what they didn't get into was that their partial vacuum is ~99% to a perfect vacuum. The difference is irrelevant when you're talking a chamber this large. The second prototype is currently using steel so thin it can't even support it's own weight, and they want to suspend it on pylons. And the suggested plan is to run this thing in a loop the length of California? Any earthquake, any car crash into a pillar, any punk kid who throws a brick at it, any significant falter in it's construction or due to weathering, and the thing can implode. Thicker steel and more structural support can only offset the danger until the construction is too expensive to be feasible. Boarding would require chambers to hold the vacuum in the whole system while the train is accessed. Then it has to be sealed and vacuumed. They will have to build the biggest vacuum system in the world to pull a perfect vacuum in an appreciable amount of time and keep the whole system under vacuum, because the test track took about an hour per, and they had to pressurize the whole thing every time the opened it. It currently takes longer to pull a vacuum than it would take to travel the length of California by more conventional means. Trains are not cost effective for passenger travel because the maintenance costs are astronomical and commuter needs are at odds, too many stops, and it's not time effective and will drive away customers, too few stops and you won't have enough customers to be cost effective. High speed trains are ever more so expensive and dangerous. In an airplane at 640 mph, any sort of bump, and you have miles space to gracefully dampen it. Any bump in a bullet train, and no matter what, it has to remain on it's rails, and now it has to remain on its rails and not hit the walls of the vacuum chamber. Overall, the thing is insane and the liability is huge. No one would seriously fund this project and no government safety regulators would ever allow it to go into production. But I appreciate it for what it is, and that is to get engineers and students thinking outside the box. That's all. This is a publicity stunt and they know it, but it's also a prospect for innovation they might scoop up and invest in. Wow, some serious negativity here. First of all, most tech starts out like this, doesn't it? Once upon a time people said ""You can't travel underwater/over 100MPH/through the air/in outer space, it's too expensive/dangerous/the tech can't handle it!"" I guess it's a good thing not everyone said ""Yeah, you're right, let's drop the whole thing"". Just because we can't do something *today*, or it isn't perfectly efficient/safe/etc., doesn't mean it shouldn't be explored and developed. The speed gains over conventional high speed rail are negligible. The construction and operating costs are **way** higher (making a near-vacuum takes a *lot* of energy). And safety... Well, you've got a positively pressurized vessel inside a negatively pressurized vessel, and they're moving relative to each other at the speed of sound... In a nutshell; it won't work. The youtube channel Thunderf00t has several good videos which breakdown exactly why. Start here URL_1 (commentary begins at 1:36). Or his most recent video on the topic URL_0 (edit: added extra link) Stuff You Should Know did a pretty good podcast covering the in's and out's of the Hyperloop. Pretty recently too, as of 03/23. Enjoy! [Hyperloop / SYSK]( URL_0 ) Unfortunately the hyper loop has a few problems; known, speculative and assumed. We know the cost due to the price of steel and manufacturing, the well known phenomena of [cascade collapse]( URL_0 ), material expansion due to heat (he chose a desert of all places!), and energy costs, [dangers]( URL_1 ) and time of producing a near vacuum. We suppose that the hyper loop would have problems with multiple destinations, turning and basic commuting. We assume that there will be some radical who sees the hyper loop as a target and protecting all 600 miles will be infeasible. Hope this summarized everything nicely! I included videos just as an example of what I'm talking about. Allow me to sum up the comments. Most posts ... Reasonable points show this is dangerous and that i see no way of over comming.

Why do cars tick when they're hot after stopping?,"Cars are made of metal. When you stop your car, the metal parts expand, making them a little bit loose.

So as the parts cool and shrink a bit they move ever so slightly and make a small noise. Alot of the time it tends to come from the exhaust system as it changes temperature the quickly and is made of fairly thin metal, so it works like a bell when any small thing changes. Think of a house creaking at night when the temperature drops.

"Why do power tools (especially ones that need high torque) often employ a motor spinning at a ridiculous speed and then a deep reduction, instead of a motor spinning directly at the tool's speed and higher torque?","The motor is spinning faster than the tool needs, but the motor can handle more torque. So the motor is used to produce the higher torque needed, and then the speed is reduced to the speed the tool needs. It's kind of like a big car engine, but it's only using the engine to produce power. It's like a car engine with a big turbocharger on it, but it's only using the engine to make power, and the turbocharger is just a way to make the engine produce more power.","An electric motor works by having magnets and electromagnets arranged around the axle, which attract and repel each other in succession to spin the motor. To get high torque you need to have very strong magnets and/or very strong electromagnets. Increasing the strength of the magnets and/or electromagnets by 20 times you will have a motor which is 20 times as big and heavy. On the other hand, electric motors can naturally spin at very high rates. A reduction gear which increases torque by 20 times (and reduces RPM) will be smaller and lighter than the motor you attach it to, making this a far better solution to get high torque at low RPM than building a bigger motor would be. essentially the way the motor works is a bunch of electromagnets pulling the axle around in a circle. if the axle was spinning slowly, the resistance from the load (whatever you're drilling) would stop the motor and it wouldn't get to the next coil. by having the main axle spin fast, it is more stable and therefore can have more torque. The power of an electric motor is mostly limited by overheating. Making the motor spin faster makes it easier to cool it. If you tried to input so much power into a slowly spinning motor, you would melt it. Some large motors can also be designed to work at precisely defined speed, so you need reduction to make them work correctly.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.32, 'recall': 21.05, 'fmeasure': 30.5}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.6, 'recall': 3.25, 'fmeasure': 4.72}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.72, 'recall': 10.93, 'fmeasure': 15.84}}"

why is making the bottom of a soda can a dome makes it use less metal?,"The metal used in the can is not wasted. The dome is shaped to allow the liquid to expand as it is heated by the sun. This is called ""thermal expansion"" and is a common phenomenon in materials that are heated. The shape of the can allows the liquid to expand and contract as the temperature changes. The dome shape also helps to prevent the liquid from spilling out of the can when it is inverted.","By making it a dome the force of pressure inside is born by the compressive strength of the metal and not by its resistance to bending. This allows a thinner metal to be used. It allows you to make a thinner can, because the dome evenly distributes the load as opposed, just as in architecture. This is a pretty good video if you're interested in learning more: URL_0 Former structural engineer here, but this is close enough of an analogy. The dome shape is intended to reduce unwanted stresses in the metal. By arranging the very thin metal as a dome, it reduces the bending stress, favoring pure compression/tension. The reason we don't want bending stress is the way the material is asked to respond. Bending means that the can's wall needs to develop a thin zone of compression on top of a thin zone of compression, that taken together result in bending. Think of an I-beam in a building: if you look at its cross section, it is optimized to develop these tension and compression zones **way** out at the top and bottom. Compare an I-beam cross section to the cross section of a can wall (just a rectangle a mm thick) to understand why thin metals do **not** want to be bent.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.84, 'recall': 21.27, 'fmeasure': 31.65}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.67, 'recall': 5.0, 'fmeasure': 7.46}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.89, 'recall': 11.31, 'fmeasure': 16.84}}"

How was Venice built?,"The Romans had a port city called Portus. They used it as a shipping hub and a trading post. When the Roman Empire fell, the people of Portus moved to the nearby islands of the lagoon. The islands were marshy and low-lying, but the people of Portus knew how to build on marshy land. They used a technique called ""fondamenta"". This means that they built a foundation for their buildings out of wood. The foundation was made of wood because the marshy ground was soft and would have collapsed if they had built it out of stone. The foundation was made of wood because it was cheap and easy to get. They built the houses on top of the foundation. The houses were made of wood and stone. They used the stone from the nearby mountains. The houses were built very close together. This made it easy for people to trade with each other. The houses were also very close to the water. This made it easy for people to travel to other places.  us knew how to build on marshy land.

Think of it like a series of toothpicks stuck into clay. If you get enough toothpicks you can hold up an entire book. If you get enough pilasters you can hold up a building.

"What's the likelihood of a battery in an electric car, like Tesla, to blow up, like the Samsung phones?"," Likelihood is very low. Batteries in electric cars are designed to last for 100,000 miles. They have built in safety features that prevent them from overcharging. They also have built in cooling systems to keep the batteries from overheating. The batteries are also made up of many small cells that are connected together in series. If one cell fails, the car can still drive. Battery safety is a huge concern for automakers. In fact, it is one of the most important things they consider when designing and manufacturing their cars. The battery in a car like a Tesla is not like the battery in your phone or laptop. It is designed to be a lot more reliable and durable. It is also designed to be safe. Automakers go to great lengths to make sure that their batteries are safe. They do this in part by using advanced safety features in the batteries themselves. For example, the batteries in a Tesla have built in cooling systems that prevent them from overheating. The batteries are also made up of many small cells that are connected together in series. If one cell fails, the car can still drive. Automakers also take steps to make sure that their batteries are safe by testing them in extreme conditions.  ","In the same way as the Samsung phones? Next to none. The trouble with phones is that phones are small, and the industry (and consumers) are obsessed with thinness. As a result, manufacturers keep trying to cram the maximum amount of battery capacity they can into the smallest amount of room. Lithium batteries have safety mechanisms, but those also take room, which is extremely scarce in a cell phone. By comparison, a car has way more room in it. Protection circuitry is tiny when you compare it to the size of a car, but far more significant when you compare it to the size of a phone. So while in phones there is a lot of incentive to go to extreme lengths to squeeze the last 5% in, in a car that's much less of a problem. Tesla not only has room for better monitoring circuitry than a phone does, but also has good physical shielding for the battery. Another difference is the use they make of the battery. Phones are effectively disposable -- the battery only needs to last a couple years. Car batteries however cost on the order of $10K and are supposed to last for more than a decade. So Tesla cars handle their battery way more carefully and don't actually use the entire capacity to maximize battery life. This also stresses the battery less than a phone would. None of that means a Telsla battery can't be made to catch fire -- that can be done if you physically damage for instance.

Why does the space shuttle or the soyuz need special tiles to reenter the atmosphere but spacex falcon does not?,"  Space Shuttle and Soyuz are designed to land on a runway, with a large portion of the heat generated during reentry being dissipated by the atmosphere.   Falcon 9 is designed to land vertically, with a much smaller portion of the heat being dissipated by the atmosphere.   heat shield is made of a ceramic material called Avcoat. This material is made of a mixture of silicon carbide and aluminum oxide, which has a high melting point.   Avcoat is applied to a fiberglass substrate, which is then covered with a ceramic coating.   Avcoat is then sandblasted to roughen the surface, which helps to increase the surface area of the heat shield.   Avcoat is then covered with a thin layer of ablator material, which is made of a mixture of silicon carbide and aluminum oxide.   ablator material is designed to ablate, or burn away, during reentry, which helps to dissipate the heat generated during reentry.   heat shield is then covered with a protective layer of Kevlar, which is designed to protect the heat shield from damage during reentry.   heat shield is then attached to the rest of the spacecraft.   heat shield is then tested to ensure that it can withstand the heat generated during reentry.  ","Are you talking about the Falcon 9 first stage, or the actual Dragon capsule? If you're talking about the Falcon 9 first stage, that's because it separates from the rest of the rocket at a relatively low altitude and speed, and thus there's less heat during reentry. It also burns it's engines to slow down to further reduce heating. If you're talking about the Dragon capsule, it does have tiles. The shuttle and Dragon have reusable tiles since the shuttle was reusable and so is the Dragon. The Soyuz does not have tiles. It has a simple ablative heat shield because the capsule is not reusable. Once it lands back on earth, its job is done, so the heat shield does not need to reused either. The falcon is just the first stage rocket and never gets anywhere near the speed needed for orbit. Thus, it does not heat up nearly as much during the landing phase. Don't think about the heat tiles as being about heat. Think about them being brake pads. Crazy right? What the heat shield is ACTUALLY doing isn't protecting the ship from heat, rather it is slowing the ship down from EXTREMELY fast orbital speeds to basically conventional falling speeds. It does this breaking through air friction (the aerodynamics involved are a lot more complicated than simply saying friction but really that's what it boils down to). The friction (and those other aerodynamic effects) are what cause the heating.

Master and Slave Cylinders in cars, Pistons and Piston Rings. How they work and what they do. Pistons and Piston Rings. How they work and what they do. Pistons and piston rings are two components that are essential to the operation of a car engine. Pistons are cylindrical parts that move up and down inside the engine cylinder. They are connected to the crankshaft and are driven by the rotating crankshaft.  s are sealed by piston rings.   rings are made of a ring of metal with a rubber seal in the middle.   ring is compressed between the piston and the cylinder wall.   ring is compressed by the rotating piston and the cylinder wall.   ring helps to seal the piston in the cylinder. This prevents the piston from moving out of the cylinder and allows the piston to move up and down smoothly inside the cylinder.   ring also helps to lubricate the piston and the cylinder wall.   ring is lubricated by the oil in the engine.   ring also helps to cool the piston.   ring is made of a ring of metal with a rubber seal in the middle.  ,"A master cylinder pushes hydraulic fluid through a hose. A slave cylinder is attached to the other end of the hose, and is pushed by that fluid. This is a clever, simple mechanism for transferring motion from one place to another.

Why is Asian steel considered inferior to American and European steel?,"Asian steel is not considered inferior. There is no inherent difference in steel quality between Asian and American steel. The difference is in the quality of the steel mills and their processes. It is true that some Asian steel mills produce lower quality steel, but it is also true that some American and European steel mills produce lower quality steel. The difference is that the Asian mills are not as well regulated and don't have to follow the same standards as American and European mills. The steel mills in the US and Europe are required to meet very high standards of quality, and they are inspected regularly to ensure that they are meeting those standards. In contrast, the steel mills in Asia are not as well regulated, and they are not subject to the same standards. The quality of the steel in the US and Europe is therefore much better than in Asia. The steel in the US and Europe is also produced in smaller quantities, which means that it is more expensive.   Asia is produced in larger quantities, which means that it is cheaper. The steel in the US and Europe is also produced using more advanced technology, which means that it is stronger.   Asia is produced using less advanced technology, which means that it is weaker. The steel in the US and Europe is also produced using higher quality raw materials, which means that it is stronger.  ","It's not Asian steel, it's Japanese steel (remember that Asia is a huge continent with more than half of the global population). As for why, it mostly comes down to bad luck. Japan is simply not blessed with good sources of iron (that's part of why they were so hard up to invade China before and during World War II). Traditional Japanese swordsmithing used iron sand, and with the smelting technology of the day that produces a very impure and comparatively low-quality steel. The folding and hammering that goes into making a traditional sword was partially to counteract the poor-quality materials. As for Chinese steel, that's really the same as Chinese products in general being cheap and low-quality. Apparently manufacturers sometimes try to pass off low-quality metal as prime steel. There's nothing really special about China in that respect; it's just that right now they're the foremost producer of cheap stuff. 50 years ago Japan was in the same boat, ironically. 150 years ago it was Germany. ""Additives in some Chinese steel used to reinforce concrete can affect the metal’s strength when it is welded and now UK industry is highlighting the dangers posed by it. Chinese steel makers sometimes add boron to their products to get a tax rebate as it was classed as an alloy. When the steel joined by arc welding, boron can make welds more likely to crack, weakening structures. The risk comes from current regulations not requiring steel-makers to specify how much boron has been added if the steel is used for reinforced bar – or rebar – which is added to concrete to strengthen it. If steel contains additives, different welding techniques have to be used so eliminate the risk of cracking."" Source: URL_0 I think you are mixing two things: Katanas were made of Tamahagane which was a kind of steel made from iron sand (satetsu) which was not a very good iron ore to begin with so the result was a somewhat impure heterogeneous steel. Nowadays the steel companies are not necessarily (mostly not) the ones that extract and/ refine the iron. The process of making a good steel is something that has to do not only with a proper mixing of ingredients but also with the treatment of the resulting material in different stages of cooling. This is because steel is actually a crystalline material. This crystals can very in size and length. In order to make a resistant steel u need to produce long shaped crystals so that it is harder to brake when bent. This knowledge is not necessarily sheared by big steel companies that also have been doing this for centuries in some cases. So that's why Asian steel can be of less quality nowadays.

Why hydraulic presses are so strong.,"The hydraulic press is strong because it is able to apply a large force over a small area. This is due to the fact that the press is able to apply a large force with a small amount of mass. The hydraulic press is a machine that uses a hydraulic cylinder to apply a large force to an object. The cylinder consists of a piston that moves back and forth in a cylindrical chamber. When the piston moves back and forth, it pushes on the sides of the cylinder, which causes the piston to move back and forth. When the piston moves back and forth, it pushes on the object that is being pressed. The strength of the hydraulic press is determined by the size of the cylinder and the force that the piston is able to apply to the object. In order to increase the strength of the hydraulic press, you need to increase the size of the cylinder and the force that the piston is able to apply to the object.","Hydraulic presses have very large mechanical advantage. When you have gears, connecting one gear to another that's twice as big gives you twice as much force. To get a lot more force, you need a pretty bulky mechanical contraption. In a hydraulic press, it's the ratio of the area of the big piston to the area of the little piston. Area is the square of dimension, so a piston that's 5 times bigger applies 25 times more force. That lets you apply a lot of force with a smaller gizmo.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 24.86, 'recall': 46.24, 'fmeasure': 32.33}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.3, 'recall': 17.39, 'fmeasure': 12.12}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 16.76, 'recall': 31.18, 'fmeasure': 21.8}}"

"Why are blueprints blue, and not another color?","Because blueprints are used for architectural drawings, blue is the color associated with architecture and engineering.

It's also a color that is easy to see from a distance and it's also a color that is associated with precision and accuracy.","Actually modern blueprints are black on white, but the name came from when they were white on blue. This was because one of the earliest copy process resulted in white lines on blue background. With architectural and engineering drawings where there a re lots of little details and accuracy is very important, making exact reproductions can be complicated and alternatives such as redrawing the entire thing with a pantograph or similar is not the ideal solution. This is why such chemical copying processes where used in this area first before better methods that reproduced black on white as black on white where invented. Originally blueprints were the only way of making copies of technical drawings and the process involved exposing the special paper to ammonia. I imagine that the interaction between the chemical coating of the paper and the ammonia produced the blue color, but I can't tell you the exact reason for it being blue and not another color. edit: Here is why they were blue: In 1861, Alphonse Louis Poitevin, a French chemist, found that ferro-gallate in gum is light sensitive.[4] Light turns this to an insoluble permanent blue. A coating of this chemical on a paper or other base may be used to reproduce an image from a translucent document. URL_0 well it would be a little silly if blueprints were green now wouldn't it? As a side note to other people's correct answers the technical term is actually ""schematics"" and *blueprint* was just the early printing technique that was commonly used so the terms became synonymous. The process used to make blueprints is called Cyanotype. It works using a greenish blue solution of ammonium Iron citrate and potassium ferricyanide. These 2 chemicals in solution are painted or soaked in to a surface, usually paper. Next, the design to be transferred is drawn on to transparent acetate film in black. Back before printers and computers engineers used to draw these by hand. The soaked paper and acetate are placed in an exposure machine which blasts the paper with UV light, but the areas which have been drawn in block the light. UV light makes the 2 compounds react. The important thing about the reaction is that it makes the parts exposed to the light harden and become insoluble in water. The parts that are covered don't react and can be washed away. Long story short blueprints are blue because the cyanotype process makes *blue prints*! Simple as that.

The hiss is the sound of the air expanding, kind of like when you open a can of soda.","Either the air brakes bleeding off air from excess pressure, or the pneumatic operators for the door, or the pneumatic lift (if equipped) Large vehicles like buses have air operated brakes. When a driver is ready to move the vehicle from the parked position, he depresses a button that applies air to release the parking brake. When comes to a stop, he pulls the button out to release the air and apply the parking brake before opening the door. That's the loud ""pshhh"" you hear. The brakes on these vehicles are designed to be applied unless the air pressure is sufficient enough to release them. If the vehicle develops an air leak, the brakes will automatically apply. This design is a failsafe. If they used air pressure to press the brake shoes against the drums, and they lost pressure, there would be no brakes. It's actually a simple design. A compressor on the engine pressurized multiple air reserve tanks. At each wheel, there are devices that contain powerful springs. These springs keep constant pressure on a lever that makes the brake shoes contact the drums. When the driver releases the parking brake, these devices fill with air and compress the spring, lifting the shoes from the drum and freeing the wheel so it can travel. When the driver presses the brake pedal while driving, air pressure is released allowing the spring to apply pressure to the brakes. This is a simplified explanation, but you get the idea.

TTYs (text shells outside of graphical environments) on Linux and the rest of the Unix family tend to be white-on-black for much the same reason: it turns out to be the option that requires pretty much the least graphics-processing, which means it's likely to work pretty much universally - great if your GUI subsystem breaks. It's also due to the Unix heritage of dedicated terminals, which would have been entirely text-based with a dark background. This doesn't apply to terminal emulators, which can be configured for any colour scheme - whether under Linux, BSD, or Mac OS X. The Windows Command Prompt is white-on-black largely because people and applications *expect* it to be.

Why are batteries like AA and AAA almost always inserted in opposite directions for polarity?

The zinc carbonate is not a conductor and will not carry electricity. So if you put the zinc electrode in contact with the carbon electrode, the zinc oxide will be formed and the zinc carbonate will be formed. The zinc oxide is a conductor, but the zinc carbonate is not. So the positive electrode will be conducting electricity and the negative electrode will not.

"when you flush a toilet, how does the water get sucked? Is it by a vacuum or the just the additional water that is added","It's not a vacuum. The water is sucked by the pressure difference between the water in the bowl and the water in the pipe. The water in the bowl is much higher pressure than the water in the pipe. The pressure is created by gravity, the weight of the water in the bowl. When you flush the toilet, the water in the bowl is released to the pipe. The water in the pipe is much lower pressure than the water in the bowl. The pressure difference between the two causes the water in the bowl to flow out.","Conventional toilets work on water being added from above. The force of the water rushing in and then pouring over the top of the S-bend sucks the contents of the bowl out. When the flush cycle completes, the toilet trickle-fills the bowl a bit more in order to wash the sides of the bowl and fill the S-bend to the point that an air seal is created to keep the smell out. Conventional toilets do **not** work on siphons. If this were the case, when one toilet in the house flushed, all of them would, because they are all connected to a common sewer stack. In reality, the stack is vented to the outside above the rooftops to allow pressure to equalize, preventing one flush from causing a cascade. **TL;DR:** Toilets flush from the action of the water surging into the bowl and over the S-bend. No vacuum, suction, or siphon is involved, as sewer systems are not designed for that. **Edit: I've been corrected by people more knowledgable in plumbing. There is a siphon involved, but only through the S-bend.** Depends on the toilet. Nearly all flush toilets have piping that goes like a un shape, with the bowl at the top of the u and the drain out the bottom of the n. The bottom of the u is filled with water, the top of the n and the drain is air. In the 'washdown' design it is just the force of the water falling down from the tank that flushes. It makes the water level rise in the u, go over the top of the n, and flow away. The water level won't change much when you flush. This design is the norm in Europe. In the 'siphon' design part of the pipe is narrowed and the water rushes in. This makes the water level in the bowl rise rapidly while the water moves into the pipe more slowly and totally fills it. The water level in the pipe goes round the top of the n and this starts a siphon, pulling the water round and out of the bowl. Only once the water in the bowl drops to the bottom of the U can air get in and break the siphon. This design is the norm in North America. And yes, it's a siphon. It doesn't affect the rest of the toilets because the siphoning water flow is only in the pipework for that toilet, with air further down the drains. There are some other designs, but those are the main ones. EDIT: To be clear. A difference is that in the washdown design, the top of the un bend is always an air space even during the flush. In the siphonic design it fills completely with water when it flushes.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 79.8, 'recall': 16.63, 'fmeasure': 27.53}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 39.8, 'recall': 8.23, 'fmeasure': 13.64}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 57.58, 'recall': 12.0, 'fmeasure': 19.86}}"
How do you come to a full stop in a stick shift vehicle?,"I'm assuming you mean how do you come to a full stop in a manual transmission vehicle. The answer is you shift into first gear. When you're driving a stick shift, you have to use the clutch to change gears. To come to a full stop, you shift into first gear, then slowly release the clutch while pressing the brake pedal. When you're ready to stop, slowly release the clutch while pressing the brake pedal. When you release the clutch, the engine will start to slow down, and when you're ready to stop, you should release the clutch slowly to avoid jolting the vehicle. I've been driving a stick shift for over 10 years now, and I can tell you that it takes some practice to get it right. You'll get better with time, but you'll still make mistakes. That's why it's important to take your time when you're driving.","Brake as normal. Leave the gearstick alone. When the engine is about to stall, depress the clutch. If you don't want to keep your foot on the clutch, you can choose to put the car in neutral and then release it. An alternative technique is to shift down through each gear as you're braking. That was used more with older cars that didn't have such good brakes, shifting down meant the engine could help slow the car. With modern cars most drivers don't bother. EDIT: And in fact organisations that teach driving, for both new learners and 'advanced' driver training, favour the 'block shifting' method where you brake down to your new speed then change into the gear for that speed. For example doing 70 mph in 6th gear, brake to 30 mph, then select 4th gear. The wear you put on a vehicle by holding the clutch down completely is negligible. If it is a long stop, put it in neutral, otherwise just make sure you are not halfway on the clutch. You just put the car in neutral and brake like normal. The car will only stall if it's in gear and you release the clutch. If it's not in gear nothing will happen when you release it. The car must be in neutral if you want to release the clutch and stay still. This is a good plan, as just holding in the clutch can cause throwout bearing wear. To start moving again, you depress the clutch, put the car in gear, and move the right foot from the brake to the gas.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 50.0, 'recall': 29.41, 'fmeasure': 37.04}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.18, 'recall': 4.8, 'fmeasure': 6.05}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.38, 'recall': 14.34, 'fmeasure': 18.06}}"
"The difference and correlation between horsepower, torque, acceleration, and top speed in a vehicle.","[The same goes for any other vehicle, not just cars. For example, a motorcycle.] The difference between horsepower and torque is that they are two different measures of how much power a vehicle can produce. Horsepower (hp) is a measure of how much power a vehicle can produce over a certain period of time. It is calculated by measuring the power output of the engine over a period of time (usually 1 minute). Torque (ft-lbs) is a measure of how much twisting force a vehicle can produce at a certain point in time. It is calculated by measuring the torque produced by the engine at a certain point in time (usually 1 minute). Top speed is how fast a vehicle can go. It is measured in miles per hour (mph). Acceleration is how fast a vehicle can go from one speed to another. It is measured in miles per hour per second (mph/s). I hope that helps! I know it’s long but I wanted to give you a good explanation. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know!","Horsepower is a unit of Power, which is a physics term. Its equivalent in Metric is the Watt. Power means force multiplied by speed. (Something that is *powerful* can move something very heavy, very fast.) Torque is similar to Power, except it means it's spinning, and doesn't matter how quickly the energy is being transferred. Acceleration means how quickly something can change speed. (Does it take 5 seconds to go from 0 to 10mph? 2 seconds? 1 second?) Acceleration *feels* like how much you get pushed into your seat. High acceleration means you can reach a high speed in a short amount of time. The top speed doesn't really depend on any one particular factor: it's often a combination of many things. Combustion engines can only go as fast as the pistons allow before they break. Cars sometimes can only go as fast as their aerodynamics permit them, or else they would lose grip and flip over. Electric cars can only go as fast as the amperage of the batteries permit. Horsepower is directly proportional to torque. An engine that makes a constant amount of torque over its entire RPM range will produce twice as much horsepower at 4000 RPMs as it will at 2000 RPMs. This is why low-revving engines produce lots of torque with little horsepower and why high-revving engines produce a lot of horsepower with little torque. Torque, by itself, is somewhat meaningless because transmission gearing allows the engine to trade rotation speed for more torque. If you have a 2:1 gearing, an engine rotating at 4000 RPM will rotate a driveshaft at 2000 RPM. The engine will effectively put out twice the torque but at half the speed. Similarly, a 100:1 ratio will produce 100x as much torque but only at 1/100 the speed. In either case, the horsepower is the same. This is why dyno tests are done in the gear where the ratio is as close to 1:1 as possible, so as to measure the engine's torque output most accurately. Acceleration is the direct result of horsepower applied to the mass of the car. The more horsepower, the faster the acceleration. The more massive the car, the slower the acceleration. Practically, acceleration will be limited by the grip available to the tires as well as air resistance and whatnot. Top speed is the point at which the produced horsepower is insufficient to accelerate the vehicle any faster, most significantly against the increasing resistance produced by the vehicle moving faster through the air. To sum things up, all four elements are directly proportional. All other things being equal, an increase in torque will mean an increase in horsepower, acceleration, and top speed (limited, of course, by grip and aerodynamic drag).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.75, 'recall': 24.25, 'fmeasure': 34.66}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.81, 'recall': 4.3, 'fmeasure': 6.15}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.12, 'recall': 9.23, 'fmeasure': 13.19}}"

Humans have had stone tools since before we became 'humans' - i.e. since about a million years ago (and some are argued to be over 3million years old). Stone tools were the standard item for cutting and trimming - including nails and hair. Despite popular imagination of them as just rocks they were highly crafted and sophisticated tools, carefully shaped for purpose. We can see this behaviour described in the historical record when different cultures meet. People did also of course wear/break nails through daily use and tie their hair back, both of which happen today. Some cultures used animal fat in their hair as a kind of grease to hold it back or make it stick up and make them look bigger. Medieval people used scissors for hair but the scissors that existed were too big for nails. They did it the same way Romans did - with small knives (think paring knives rather than daggers). Source: my degree in archaeology and history. Cavemen didn't cut their hair as hair provided extra warmth. As for nails they were used as tools so they were worn down naturally, if they became too long they probably chewed them or filed them with rocks. In medieval times they had scissors that they used to cut their nails. I have not once cut my 2.5 year old son's nails. He apparently wears them down naturally, or that is what his pediatrician says. So weird. I am inclined to believe the other poster who said that cavemen wore them down working with tools. I'm so confused why people would think you'd need tools or teeth to cut nails here. My entire life I've been able to cut my nails using my finger nails like it's the easiest thing in the world. I can't imagine why you would bite them unless it's somehow more pleasant, but I think that's bad for your teeth so I've never been tempted. If you think about it, the lifestyle of the primitive humans allowed them to succesfully pass on their genes and live in harmony with the world for hundreds of thousands of years. Here we are completely fucking everything up in a tenth of the time, wondering ""were our ancestors capable of basic hygienic maintenance?"". Yet we don't ever ask ""how did they live in such a sustainable way in complete harmony with every other species on earth for so long?"" *i should not have said ""complete harmony with every other species"". What I really meant was that we weren't causing extinction at a massively increasing rate I don't use nail-cutters or tools to cut my nails. You can bite off the ones on your fingers and carefully tear the ones on your toes. It's really not hard and it means I don't have to try and remember where I put the nail-cutters every time I want them trimmed EDIT: Why the downvotes? I gave an example of a perfectly simple way to trim your nails without nail-cutters. I'm not saying that's necessarily what they did or if they even them trimmed at all. I'm saying that it's very easy to cut your nails without tools... They could probably just chew down the nail, or break it and tear off the excess. > How were hairs cut without scissors in stone age Sharp edges have always existed, even if we assume that cavemen cant produce one (go break a rock) you could still use animal claws or something. You can still cut hair with a blade. Lindow man (Pete Marsh) was from around 2 BC to 119 AD and had manicured nails according to investigations. I believe that the microscope revealed that his nails had been cut with an instrument which may have been scissor-like. ""In life, Lindow Man would have measured between 5'6"" and 5'8"" (1.68 and 1.73 m) tall and weighed about 132 pounds (60 kg). It was possible to ascertain that his age at death was around the mid-20s.

","There are [tunnel-boring machines]( URL_0 ), which are essentially huge metal walls the shape of the tunnel that slowly chew into the dirt/rock ahead of them, throwing it behind the wall. From there, conveyor belts or carts move the dirt/rock back to the surface, where they dump it somewhere. Right behind the boring machine, workers line the tunnel with concrete and support structures to seal and strengthen it. The boring goes pretty slowly, so the fresh tunnel gets concrete pretty much as soon as it is excavated. Engineers design the tunnel so the finished structure (after concrete application) doesn't collapse. They don't go ""underwater"" they dig through the ground hundreds of feet below the bottom of the river Mining engineer here.

Why on boats are the propellors at the back yet on planes they are on the front?,"1. The propeller is not the only thing that creates lift. Aircraft have lift from the wings and the propeller creates thrust. Lift is created by the shape of the wing and the air flowing over it. Thrust is created by the air flowing over the propeller. The propeller is not just creating thrust, it is also creating lift. 2. Boats need a lot of thrust to move forward. Planes need a lot of lift to stay in the air. The shape of the wing is more important for lift than the propeller is for thrust. 3. The propeller on a plane is much smaller than the propeller on a boat. This means that the propeller on a plane needs to spin faster to produce the same amount of thrust. A plane needs to go much faster to produce enough lift to stay in the air. 4. The propeller on a plane is also angled differently. The propeller on a plane is angled so that it is pulling the air downwards. The propeller on a boat is angled so that it is pushing the water backwards. 5. The propeller on a plane is also much more efficient. The propeller on a plane is much more efficient because it is angled so that it is pulling the air downwards. This means that it needs to spin slower to produce the same amount of thrust.  ","Some issues: 1. Turbulence. When the medium through which your propeller moves is turbulent, you get wildly varying power levels. So you want to avoid feeding very turbulent air/water into your propeller. On a plane, the airframe itself generates a good deal of turbulence. On a boat, the hull alone generally won't impart enough energy to the water to create significant turbulence because water is much more dense than air. 2. Steerage. If you place the engine at the front, the resistance of the medium around your craft will tend to cause the craft to align along the direction of travel. If you place the engine at the back, the resistance of the medium will tend to deflect the craft from the direction of travel. With a plane, you need some pretty significant control surfaces to overcome this effect because air doesn't pose much of an obstacle to yawing uncontrollably. On a boat, it's nearly impossible to deflect its course in this manner because you'd need to displace enormous amounts of water to move sideways. 3. Boat propellers only work underwater. Even with the denser medium, it still makes sense to put the propeller on the front of the boat - the water just makes it less impractical to put the propeller on the back, it doesn't make it *better*. What makes it better is that the front of your boat leaves the water in situations where you need powered propulsion (climbing up a wave) while the back of your boat leaves the water in situations where you don't (climbing back down the wave). In the first case, gravity is opposing your direction of travel so a loss of propulsion means you fall back. In the latter case, gravity is assisting your direction of travel so a loss of propulsion means you keep moving forward anyways. One reason on ships, and small boats with fixed engines, is that the water from the propellor flows directly onto the rudder. That means that the steering effect is greater as the concentrated water stream from the prop is deflected by the rudder blade to turn the boat. Aeroplanes are to a large part steered by banking the wings to change the direction of the ""lift"". The propeller hits the ground when the plane takes off. But you want that to happen with a boat. Well I'm no expert, but when a boat goes on plane you wouldn't have much prop if none at all in the water. Plus you don't want to much weight on the front of the boat either. Trolling motors go almost exclusively on the front of the boat because why not? They can't get on plane. Also, if the motor was on the front you wouldn't be able to beach your boat.

Edit: Another reason popped in my head.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.51, 'recall': 27.57, 'fmeasure': 37.27}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.21, 'recall': 5.36, 'fmeasure': 7.25}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.61, 'recall': 12.76, 'fmeasure': 17.25}}"

My apologies Since you seem to be focused on the physics of it, just think about how dirty cars get - and stay - even though they regularly reach high speeds. Dirt, mud, bugs, bird poop, and even exhaust particles get on there and require specific conditions to be removed. Even driving quickly through rain doesn't do much to clean a car. Matter tends to get stuck to matter (with the exception of repellant substances, e.g. oil vs water), including at the microscopic level. The San people of southern Africa are likely some of the earliest users of poisoned arrows, IIRC there have been arrowheads found with poison residues on them from 50,000 years ago. They use a number of poisonous plants in their recipes, but the most effective toxin comes [from the larva of a small beetle]( URL_0 ). The beetle larva is harmless if eaten, unless you have a cut in your mouth. You can imagine what happened to the poor guy who first discovered this. The way that the San (who still hunt with poisoned arrows today) get the poison to stick is that their recipe always includes some resin from the acacia tree. This acacia gum is a very effective glue when it dries, so they basically first make poisoned glue and then apply it to the arrowheads. Some states still allow poisoned arrows for archery hunting. I know Mississippi is one state that does. The poison is released from a little pod placed on the arrow shaft an inch or so behind the broadhead. The pod itself is a little rubber tube that fits over the shaft. The poison in powder form is put inside the rubber pod (think almost condom like). When the arrow penetrates the animal the pod rolls inside out depositing the poison into the wound. The poison used is the fast working skeletal paralyzing chemical [suxamethonium chloride]( URL_0 ), also known as suxamethonium or succinylcholine sold as Anectine®. It's used by doctors in surgery to paralyze skeletal muscles. Enzymes in the blood quickly break down the chemical and the meat can be eaten. A lot of toxic substances can stay toxic even when they dry out. Then once the weapon pierces skin and the toxin mixes with blood, they dissolve back in and enter the victim's system directly through the open wound. To make it easier in the case of an arrow, you might put dings and dents in the arrowhead. Think of the surface of a golf ball; those can go flying at speeds much greater than an arrow, but the dimples still hold dried dirt and grass stains. It is . It is made by mixing kwuarm and dragon scale dust in a vial of water. Then you just apply it to your weapon of choice. It only comes off with a cleaning cloth. You guys are getting way too complicated with this. They would just dip the tip in poison, let it dry, take them to battle and then shoot. They would prepare them ahead of time. You wouldn't be asking this question from a computer assembled from the prison's computer disassembling program that you occasionally hide in a roof panel, would you? Years ago I saw an excellent demonstration of this in a documentary about African tribesmen. They would prepare a gord shell full of what looked like cotton or other absorbent plant fiber and they would milk venomous snakes into the absorbent. The tribesmen would carry this corked with them to keep the venom from drying and when it was time to shoot would simply dip the arrow tip into the venom. Using sharpened wood arrows the wood was absorbent enough to hold a fair amount of venom for their prey. > Edit2: Can you guys stop asking personal questions like if I'm a murderer or not? I wasn't aware this was a personal question. Hmm. My suspicions grow. In table-top role-playing games, like Dungeons & Dragons, this will come up for rogue type classes. For poison that going to be delivered by a weapon will need to be fairly thick and sticky like tar or sap. If the poison is to be ingested liquid would be best. Inhaled poison would need to be a powder. Reminds me of that meme of a show where the guy says his blade is dipped on poison then he licks it To jump onto OP's question: what about older (medieval) stories where Kings/Rulers were given poisoned crowns or cloaks? Was that an exaggeration, or did it actually happen? How was it done and, more importantly, how did it poison the victim (i.e. was it just so potent that it overwhelmed the target?)? Not a real world example but it seems pretty sound, in the night angel trilogy there's a part where it describes a character taking a knife with holes in the tip of the blade, stuffing cotton into the holes, and soaking the holes in poison. I believe the tip of the sheath held the poison so it could be reapplied in the run. Anyway, idea was as he stabbed someone the poison(venom) soaked cotton would pass through the wound and get in the blood stream. Again, not a real world example, but it makes sense and I can't think of why it wouldn't work.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.19, 'recall': 11.45, 'fmeasure': 18.96}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.32, 'recall': 2.55, 'fmeasure': 4.22}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.6, 'recall': 6.56, 'fmeasure': 10.86}}"

It’s important to make sure that the bomb is not mistaken for any other kind of aircraft, and that it is identified as a weapon. The orange color is also used to make it easier for the bomb to be seen on radar. It’s also used to make it easier to see the bomb from a distance, since it’s much easier to see a bright orange object in the sky than a dull grey one.","Orange is the color for trial and evaluation weapons. Most pictures, such as the main one on Wikipedia are of test bombs. The adopted, production MOABs are green with yellow bands/markings, which is the standard color coding for high explosive ordnance. Example of a [production MOAB.]( URL_1 ) Ordnance follow established color coding charts as much as possible to help identify their type easily. Technically the label of ""MOAB"" on the side should be yellow not white according to the chart, but whoever approved it may have figured white was easier to read and the munition was very recognizable anyway.

Why are bumpers in cars made from plastic?,"Bumpers are designed to absorb the impact of a collision. They are made of a tough plastic to help absorb the impact, but also to be lightweight so that the car doesn't get damaged in the impact. Plastic is also less expensive than metal. It's a combination of weight and cost savings. The bumper is not designed to absorb the impact of a collision, it's there to protect the body of the car from the impact. The bumper is the part that gets damaged, not the body of the car. Plastic is much cheaper and lighter than metal, so it's easier to replace a damaged bumper than a damaged body panel.","The plastic portion you can see is actually a bumper cover. Underneath the plastic there is a strong steel bumper bolted to the frame of the car. The bumper cover is meant to be attractive, suitable for minor collisions and easy to replace.

The first image shows the bumper with impact absorbing foam still attached. URL_0 Couple reasons, first and foremost, plastic is cheap. The bumpers of the car are the most likely place you'll see damage in a small accident, so they're cheaper and easier to replace. Second, when you're in a crash (kind of counterintuitively) it's actually safer for the car to have what's called a 'crumple effect'.

How do disc brakes work?,"Disc brakes use a caliper that is mounted on the rotor (the disc). The caliper is made of two halves that are connected by a lever. The rotor is attached to the wheel.

How does an autonomous vehicle decide who dies in an unavoidable crash?,"When you're dreaming your brain is processing visual information and generating dreams. The light is from the brain processing the dream. It's like when you're tired and you can't keep your eyes open, but you can't fall asleep either.","They aren't that complex. They just try to stop the vehicle and avoid collision as best they can, they don't make assessments of likelihood of death. Once they can it will likely be legislated to judge in a certain manner. The car's programming is very simple. 1. Object in path. 2. Can I stop in time? Yes = stop. 3. If no to 2 = Can i safely swerve to avoid obstacle? Yes = swerve. 4. If no to 3 then attempt to stop and sound horn. Or something like that. Basically the car will never take a positive action that is unsafe. It doesn't know, care, or matter to the car whether the ""obstruction"" that starts this whole thing is a bag of garbage, a just reliest from jail on a technicaliy child rapist, or Jesus Christ returned to earth. If it can stop, it will. If it can swerve safely it will. If no to both, it hits. So, I love your title. however your followup took something away. From what I understand, and I am pretty up to date. If the crash in not avoidable, it will simply attempt to stop. So say 3 people randomly jump to the left, right and center of its path, it wont swerve the middle and hit the left, it will simply conclude no alt path, and break.

How are underground subways in big cities designed? Do they actually dig and drill to open up tunnels for the subway or was it already prepped when the city we designed years ago? As old as some cities are I find it amazing this would have been thought out way back when.,"In the 19th century, when subways were first built, they were mostly done by digging deep tunnels and then building the subway tracks inside them. Nowadays, the subway tunnels are built using tunneling machines that dig into the ground and then build the subway tracks inside them. The machines are usually made of steel and can dig into the ground at a rate of a few meters per day. The tunnels are built to be very strong so they can handle the weight of the subway trains and the passengers. The tunnels are also built with ventilation systems so that the air inside the tunnels is clean and safe to breathe. The subway tracks are made of steel and are connected to the tunnels. The subway trains run on the tracks and are powered by electricity. The subway stations are built on the surface and are connected to the subway tunnels by underground tunnels. The subway stations have platforms and escalators so that the passengers can get on and off the trains easily. The subway stations are also built with ventilation systems so that the air inside the stations is clean and safe to breathe.  ","London Underground is a good one to research. In some cases the tunnels were dug along the routes of existing roads, and they created a big trench, but the railway in the bottom and covered it over, then put the road back on top (""cut and cover""). In other cases, like where the railway had to go under big buildings, they mined it, in the same way that some coal mines are built, by digging a tunnel and reinforcing it as you go. I don't think there has ever been a major city where the city planners were foresighted enough to plan for mass transit before they built the city, so *all* major subway lines have been built after the city they service was already established. Pretty crazy. In some instances they're built just below street level, which, yea, is a massive undertaking, but modern cities have had to be rebuilt on that level anyway due to the foundation requirements of a large modern buildings. Depending on the substrate, they can be bored under existing construction, though obviously you have to be careful in that case not to undermine the structures above. There's different ways. Some subways are built by tunnelling through the earth beneath the city. Some subways are built by excavating the line (digging a huge trench) and then building roads and buildings on top. Most subways are a combination of both methods. Yes, they actually dig and drill to open up tunnels for the subway. One of the biggest construction projects in Britain at the moment is ""Crossrail"", a railway that includes about 22 km (14 miles) of tunnel through central London. Construction started in 2009 and the line is due to be completed next year -- that is, it's expected to over take nine years to build it.

How do weapons shoot accurately when the sights are above the barrel?,"It's called ""eye relief"". The eye relief is the distance between the lens of the sight and the point where the eye is focused. The longer the eye relief, the easier it is to aim, but the shorter the eye relief, the more the sight will move when the gun is fired. It's a compromise.","Because light is straight and bullets follow an arc (it's where the term ballistics or ballistic flight come from). The [barrel is aimed upwards]( URL_1 ) so it ""tosses"" the bullet up to or through the light path of the scope at one or two distances. The shooter chooses the distances, in advance, when setting aim, then either adjusts his scope for any other distances, or makes an adjustment to the sight picture to vary the range. In the language of shooting, the near distance chosen is the range at which the gun is ""sighted"" ""zeroed"" or ""sighted in"" and the cross hairs mark the intended point of impact. That's why accurately estimating distances have long been a part of the skill set required to be a good shot (so the proper distance adjustment to the sights could be made). On older guns (using slow, heavy bullets that need to arc more at long distances), the [rear sight]( URL_0 ) was designed to rise significantly above the barrel, so the gun's angle would rise pretty considerably. The sights can be adjusted or zeroed for different ranges. This movement in the sight compensates for the difference in elevation between the barrel and sight. The same applies for left and right movement as not everyone shoots the same and there are other factors such as wind for long distance shooting. For example if you shoot at 600m when you are zeroed at 100m you will shoot low. Take a shot at 100m when zeroed at 600m you will shoot high. Weapons are ""zeroed"" to a specific distance. Think of it as like a triangle. Your optic sight path and bullet path meet at the specifically zeroed distance. For a weapon like an M4 that distance is usually 25 meters. The sites are adjusted to point slightly down. Since a bullet drops while it is in flight, there is no one setting where the sites will be accurate at all ranges. The site are set of a particular range, and the shooter must compensate for the others. Also, the sites are about a half inch from the where the bullet leaves the gun. If that is your greatest source of inaccuracy, you are doing pretty good.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 66.67, 'recall': 10.11, 'fmeasure': 17.55}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.64, 'recall': 2.93, 'fmeasure': 5.1}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 49.12, 'recall': 7.45, 'fmeasure': 12.93}}"
Valves in engine,"are actually just a small flap that opens and closes, allowing fuel to flow into the engine or not.Ћ There is a small chamber that is connected to the engine and the fuel tank. When the engine is running, the fuel tank pushes the valve open, allowing fuel to flow into the chamber. The chamber is then compressed by the engine and the fuel is then injected into the engine. The valve is a small flap that closes when the engine is not running, preventing fuel from leaking out. When the engine is not running, the valve is closed and the fuel is stored in the tank until the engine is started again.","Engines have intake valves and exhaust valves. The intake valves open as the piston is traveling down during the ""Intake stroke"" to allow air (and fuel in some cases) to enter the combustion chamber, then the valves close. The piston then travels back up and compresses the air (and fuel in some cases) during the ""Compression stroke"". The fuel is added at this point (if it hasn't been already) and it either ignites (diesel) or is ignited by a spark plug (gasoline) and the resulting explosion forces the piston back down during the ""Power stroke"". Finally, the exhaust valves open and the piston travels up to expel the spent combustion byproducts during the ""Exhaust stroke"". This process is repeated thousands of times per minute and produces the rotational force to the transmission or transaxle and moves the vehicle. Someone discovered along the way that more valves is usually better to an extent. Two smaller valves will flow better than one larger valve, and things usually fit better that way as well. So when you hear about a 32-valve engine, it means that each of the eight cylinders has two intake and two exhaust valves. There is a lot more to this, but this is the best simplified answer I could come up with. Also, the four stages of a four stroke engine are sometimes referred to as suck, squeeze, bang, blow.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 49.56, 'recall': 24.03, 'fmeasure': 32.37}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.25, 'recall': 3.02, 'fmeasure': 4.07}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.32, 'recall': 13.73, 'fmeasure': 18.5}}"
why is it that technology is so advanced and we still can't use water or other liquids to run cars?,"The reason we can't use water is because water is a very bad conductor of electricity.

How do companies design their products such that they are very likely to break/malfunction/deteriorate short after warranty ends?,"- 1.

It is actually really hard for companies to ""get away"" with doing much that you would find despicable if you were truly informed of all the facts and issues at play. It happens, don't get me wrong, but its far less common than you think, its far harder for them to get away with it, and its seldom as overtly evil as one might think. However... Every physical object is going to have tradeoffs. Would you like your remote control to weigh twenty pounds but never wear out or need batteries - or would you like it to weigh five ounces and wear out after 10 years of average use? Customers have spoken and they want cheaper, lighter, fancier shit - and they are wiling to pay for it. So really what companies do is design the product so that in average use conditions it lasts a reasonable period of time, and then give consumers a warranty that covers a shorter, but still reasonable, period of time. And then if your toaster, or television, or jeans wear out sooner they replace them with an apology, and if they last longer... good everyone is happy. The real issue though... Seven years ago you went to the store and bought a computer for ""word processing and browsing the internet"", and now ""browsing the internet"" means streaming netflix and you are trying to use a computer capable of opening Word, and reading CNN, to run a home media center. And its not up to the task. This is done through MTBF prediction( Mean Time Between Failure). There are several methods based on field(real data) and some physics ones or simulation with which you can predict when something is going to break/fail. Best is if you have field(real) data based on previous product designs, but if none are existing then you can make accelerated lifetime tests (temperature, humidity, vibration .... anything you can think about) and then based on this how severe were the conditions during the test you can round up/predict in approximately how many hours/cycles you will get to failure. The more data is available the more accurate is the prediction. P.S. This is not used only to design the product to break after the warranty. It is vital to the maintenance of life support systems, airplanes, power plants and etc. Despite all the negative responses here, we don't design products to fail. We design products so that ~98+% will last until at least the end of the warranty period. But we also design them as cheaply as possible, and this often results in one of the parts failing shortly after the warranty period has expired. So if you want a product to last longer, buy the product with the longer warranty.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.28, 'recall': 17.09, 'fmeasure': 24.51}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.0, 'recall': 2.36, 'fmeasure': 3.39}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.91, 'recall': 7.47, 'fmeasure': 10.7}}"
Why do large military ships/vessels use nuclear power but same size or larger cruise/cargo ships don't?,"Nuclear power is more efficient than diesel. It's cheaper, more reliable and easier to maintain than diesel. But it's also heavier and takes up more space.

Ships that don't need to be fast or stay at sea for very long periods of time can get by with diesel engines, and that's why they're cheaper.","Nuclear power is difficult to do safely and the government will allow its own ships to do things private organizations can't. Also nuclear power means a warship can't be starved for fuel which is of strategic importance while cargo ships don't really worry about enemy forces cutting off their supply lines. The military values long endurance (years between refueling) over cost because long endurance improves their mission success. Largo ship and cruise line owners value low cost over endurance. With their longest voyages taking weeks rather than years, nuclear power doesn't buy them anything that they want. The advantage of nuclear power is you don't need to refuel. The drawback is it's expensive because it's heavily regulated for safety. Not worth it for a cargo ship, considering they can cross oceans on one load of fuel anyway. Sometimes worth it for a warship because refuelling could mean either leaving the warzone or meeting up with a vulnerable tanker ship. There have been a few civilian ships with nuclear power. It's good for icebreakers because they need lots of power, a Russian company called Atomflot has about five or six of them in use. Nuclear power is heavily regulated by governments, who in general do not want nuclear reactors in the hands of private companies. Particularly mobile nuclear reactors. The US has one nuclear powered merchant vessel, *The Savannah*, which operated for about ten years. It was more of a proof of concept that a practical cargo ship, and was decommissioned after it proved too expensive to operate. Because a cruise ship doesn't mind having to refuel every time it goes into port. A military vessel doesn't always have that luxury, and not having to constantly refuel simplifies the supply lines for your navy. There was a US flagged Cargo Ship built with a Nuclear reactor in the 60's. The issue with it was not the training or even regulations surround the vessel. The Issue was that it was not allowed into many foreign ports. The ship itself is now a museum. The ship was N/S Savannah. Not being aloud into foreign ports is an issue for military nuclear ships as well with regard to port of calls for liberty. Here is the wiki for the ship and associated museum. URL_0 The differences are the Pros/Cons. For a cruise liner, they value a return on investment from their business. A nuclear reactor provides power for many years into the future, but using diesel engines and fuel is cheaper. They recoup their costs and generate greater profit before the end of life of their ship. The US Govt. doesn't generate money with the ship, so ROI isn't of much consequence. The EOL of the ship is 30+ years, and the reduction in refueling times needed (coming to port) is a much greater tactical advantage than saving money in the outset.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 59.77, 'recall': 10.53, 'fmeasure': 17.9}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.63, 'recall': 2.03, 'fmeasure': 3.45}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.03, 'recall': 5.47, 'fmeasure': 9.29}}"

A blow off valve or BOV will vent excess turbo boost pressure when the throttle is closed, this generally produces a high pitched ""squeak"" An anti lag system will delay the ignition after the throttle is closed so that the fuel/air mix is still burning when it enters the exhaust manifold so keeps the turbine spinning so full boost can be made sooner when the throttle is opened again. This makes the loud pops and bangs. Also massively shortens turbo life to around 1000km.

The high pitched noise is the turbo (basically a vacuum cleaner to suck more air into the motor). The bangs are excess gas/air igniting in the exhaust when they let off the gas, because when you are sucking that much air & gas through the motor, it can't stop following instantly when you lift off the accelerator.

Why is it recommended to have an odd/prime number of stators in each stage in a jet engine?,The prime number of stators in each stage of a jet engine is due to the fact that the flow in each stage of the compressor is a combination of a rotating flow (the compressor blades) and a stationary flow (the stator).   is a series of blades that are mounted statically in the engine.   is what directs the airflow from the compressor fan to the combustion chamber.   is responsible for imparting a spinning motion to the airflow in the engine.   blades are very close to the rotor blades and are attached to the rotor shaft.   blades are positioned so that they are perpendicular to the rotor blades.   blades are positioned so that they are perpendicular to the rotor blades.   blades are positioned so that they are perpendicular to the rotor blades.   blades are positioned so that they are perpendicular to the rotor blades.   blades are positioned so that they are perpendicular to the rotor blades.   blades are positioned so that they are perpendicular to the rotor blades.   blades are positioned so that they are perpendicular to the rotor blades.  ,"Imagine one rotor blade passing by a sequence of stators. As it passes by each stator there's some change in pressure. That change in pressure will be similar for each stator it passes by. On its own that rotor blade gets some vibration with a frequency equal to the frequency at which it passes by stators. Exactly what that vibration looks like isn't important, just that it exists and is based on the frequency of passing by stators. Now imagine that you have exactly as many rotor blades as you do stators. Every single one of the blades will be at the exact same point in their vibration at the same time. If, for example, the blades are pushed forward when the rotor and stator are aligned then the entire rotor is being pushed forward all at once. Now imagine that you have exactly 1/2 as many rotor blades as there are stators. Once again you have exactly the same problem: every rotor is lining up at the same time. You could do the same with 2/3 as many blades, but now the blades line up in groups. If you have N rotor blades and M stator blades and you reduce the fraction N/M as far as you can to n/m then you'll have n groups of rotor blades that are experiencing the same vibration at the same time. The goal is to make n as large as possible. At best n = N. One way to guarantee that n = N is if N is prime. A less restrictive way of making that that guarantee is to make sure that N and M are coprime (i.e. there is no number greater than 1 that both are divisible by), and a simple way of approximating that for relatively small numbers is to make N odd and M even (or vice versa).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.37, 'recall': 26.18, 'fmeasure': 33.47}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.87, 'recall': 4.43, 'fmeasure': 5.67}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.37, 'recall': 15.46, 'fmeasure': 19.76}}"

Why does this modern jet have to fly at such and angle to go slowly? (pic below),"🚀💨 It's not so much that it has to fly at an angle, it's more that it's flying at the right angle to achieve the desired speed. Pursuit planes, which are the planes in the picture you linked, are designed to fly at a low angle of attack, which means that their wings are tilted upwards slightly. This is because when you fly at a low angle of attack, the wing produces less lift, but the drag is reduced by the same amount. This means that the plane can fly faster without having to go up to a higher altitude, which is safer.","The Typhoon is built for speed. This means that the designers have outfitted it with small thin wings. This reduce the aerodynamic drag so it can go faster. However it also reduces lift so it have to go faster to maintain its altitude. If you look at the front of the wings of the Typhoon you notice that it have its slats fully extended. Both slats and flaps are parts of the wings that can extend the surface area and thickness of the wing when extended. This allows the aircraft to have more lift which allows it to go at a slower speed. However that alone is not enough to make it fly level at the speed the picture is taken at. So the pilot have to increase the angle of attack. This will force even more air under the wing to increase the pressure and give more lift. It also change the angle of the engine so the engine also produce some lift. The problem is that if the angle of attack is too great then the air above the wing might separate from the surface of the wing which reduces lift considerably, this is called a stall. In fact on a normal airplane the control surfaces would likely have gotten into a stall just by the slight adjustments by the pilots but the Typhoon have advanced computers and multiple different control methods to prevent this from happening. The Spitfire were a very fast airplane so it should be able to fly at a much more comfortable speed for the Typhoon. I suspect the limiting speed here is the camera airplane which is likely a C-130 which is built for heavy cargo and therefore have huge thick wings which limits its top speed. In addition the camera man is likely laying on the edge of the open cargo door which puts further restrictions on the airspeed. The Typhoon pilot is comfortable with this though as he is still carrying the spare fuel tank which adds extra weight and makes flying at low speeds harder. The top speed of this WW2 aircraft was only 340 mph at 20,000ft. So the Typhoon is struggling to go slow enough, as the other answers say. However, it's actually a [Hawker Hurricane]( URL_0 ), not a Spitfire.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 66.67, 'recall': 18.13, 'fmeasure': 28.51}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 21.15, 'recall': 5.71, 'fmeasure': 9.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.33, 'recall': 9.07, 'fmeasure': 14.26}}"

","Judging by sources such as [this]( URL_0 ), I wonder if you/your grandfather might have misremembered the mileage he got out of it. 30 mpg in 1948 sounds implausible. (And if accurate, it certainly wasn't an average car) It seems like most cars of that era got around 15-20 MPG from what I've been able to find. You are not buying new cars it seems. 40 and 50 mpg is common for sedans, and 60 or more is common for hybrids. Gas mileage improved significantly after the oil crisis in 1973 until the mid 1980s. From there, they didn't increase much until 2006, when serious legislation regarding vehicle efficiency were introduced. Cars nowadays have much higher gas economy, but the average mileage of vehicle ownership has been kept low due to the slow propagation of efficient cars and the increase in sales of larger vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs. A thing to note is that you should not look at mpg for fule efficiency. The values are correct but it is hard to identify improvement. It is not obvious that a change from 10 to 20 MPG is significantly higher then a change from 20 to 50 MPG. The fule used for a 10,00 mile trip would be 10 MPG = 1000 gallons 20 MPG = 500 gallons 50 MPG = 200 gallons So the first change of 10 MPG result in 500 gallons reduction if fule consumption but the second change of 30 MPG is only a reduction of 300 gallons. You should convert them to Gallons per Mile (or 10,000 or 1000 mile) to ger a value that is easy to understand. Europe and most other parts of the world used litres per 100 km that system is equivalent to Gallons per Mile.

Why do some airplanes leave an exhaust trail but others do not?," In the 1970s, a number of people reported seeing a strange trail of smoke following airplanes. The trail was said to be long, thin, and curved, and was described as being similar to a corkscrew. The phenomenon was dubbed the ""corkscrew trail"" and was reported to be visible in the skies over the United States, Canada, and Europe. The corkscrew trail was said to be visible for several hours after the plane had passed, and was said to be visible from both the ground and the air. The trail was said to be a result of a chemical reaction between the airplane's exhaust and the atmosphere.

","It isn't exhaust. It is disturbed air that essentially creates clouds from the turbulence. And it isn't the type of plane, it is the elevation and air conditions at those elevations on that particular day. If you're talking about [contrails]( URL_0 ), those are not from exhaust. Or at least, not strictly exhaust. Contrails form when conditions are right, involving humidity, temperature, and air pressure. Small particulates from the exhaust create [nucleation sites]( URL_1 ) for ice crystals to form. Nucleation is kind of its own ELI5, but the short version is that ice can't form unless there's a place to start from. Once a little bit of ice starts, the rest of the water can stick to that to make the clump bigger, but generally something has to be there to start it. When conditions are just right, the water vapor in the air kind of primed to become thicker clouds of ice crystals, but it's not quite cold enough for ice to form without help. As the plane flies through the air, the tiny particulates provide the last bit needed for the vapor to condense into clouds of ice particles. Those clouds form the trails behind the engines. When conditions are *just* right, planes can also cause trails to form at the wingtips as the turbulence from the aerodynamics changes the air pressure, causing a trail to form. Why it happens to some planes and not others depends on the air conditions around the plane. The altitude changes those conditions, so altitude matter, airspeed matters, and small changes make a big difference so that not all planes can create them all the time.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 38.46, 'recall': 21.35, 'fmeasure': 27.46}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.16, 'recall': 2.86, 'fmeasure': 3.68}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.72, 'recall': 13.17, 'fmeasure': 16.93}}"

Gram-negative bacteria do not have a thick peptidoglycan layer and are stained pink by the Gram stain. Gram-positive bacteria are generally more resistant to antibiotics than gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria are usually encapsulated, meaning that the cell walls are covered in a thick layer of fatty substances that are not permeable to antibiotics. Gram-negative bacteria are not encapsulated, meaning that the cell walls are exposed to antibiotics.","The system of using degrees, minutes and seconds to measure angles predates the system of celestial navigation we've developed and which is still in use. There are 360 degrees in a circle, 60 minutes in a degree and 60 seconds in a minute. Modern sextants (and predecessor instruments) measure the height of objects above the horizon in degrees and minutes of arc. The nautical mile is defined so that 1 minute of arc corresponds to 1 nautical mile. In this way, the angular measures can be easily equated to distances on the map. The makes the earth's circumference 360×60=21600 nautical miles. The latitude scale on the sides of mercator maps shows minutes of latitude which can be used as a scale of nautical miles. (The scale varies with latitude, so you need to use the scale at the same latitude as your location.) Arc seconds are not used by navigators. Often the first decimal of seconds of arc is recorded: tenths of a nautical mile correspond to 1 cable which is close to 100 fathoms or 600 feet and which is the traditional length of anchor cables. The metric definition is 1852 metres to the nautical mile and 185.2 metres to the cable. The term knots arose from the log line, a rope attached to a ""log"" thrown into the sea behind a ship with the rope wound on a reel. As the first knot unwinds off the reel a 30- (or 28-) second sand glass is turned and the seaman starts counting the number of additional knots which are spaced 51 (or 47.25) feet apart. The number of knots counted by the time the sand glass runs out gives the ship's speed directly in nautical miles per hour, AKA knots. The sea was the only FAST means of travel for centuries. It needed to measure speed, not just in a few miles each hour, but more as we do today. Water is wet, messy stuff, so by sticking a fairly static floating lump in the stuff and dealing out twine with knots in it whilst counting off the time it took, gave you nautical knots. It isn't the same as miles, quite, but has it's roots in 'chains' and other olden measurement systems. The metric system using base ten is less factorable (divisible) than one with base twelve or sixteen, as the old 'imperial' systems were divided. There is considerable history to each measuring system, often with different trades using different systems, so I won't go any further off track.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 29.17, 'recall': 6.5, 'fmeasure': 10.63}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.21, 'recall': 0.93, 'fmeasure': 1.52}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.75, 'recall': 4.18, 'fmeasure': 6.83}}"

"why does charging your phone while using the headphone jack cause interference, but not when the audio is playing through your USB cord?","USB has a different impedance than headphones. Headphones are designed to be used with a 1/4"" jack which is 1/4 wavelength long. The impedance of a 1/4"" jack is 60 ohms, which is a good impedance match for headphones. USB, on the other hand, has a impedance of 90 ohms. So the impedance of USB is 150% of the impedance of the headphones. So if you're using a 1/4"" jack, the impedance of the headphones is 60 ohms and the impedance of the USB is 90 ohms. The impedance of the headphones is 60% of the impedance of the USB. So when you're charging your phone, the impedance of the headphones is 60% of the impedance of the USB. So the headphones are essentially shorting out the USB. When you're using the audio jack, the impedance of the headphones is 60% of the impedance of the USB, but the impedance of the audio jack is 60 ohms, which is a good impedance match for headphones.","USB is digital, while 3.5mm jacks transmit an analog signal. The digital signal can tolerate some noise without losing quality, while the analog signal starts losing details right away.

The novel is made up of letters, and there's only 26 letters in the English alphabet. Even if the letters get messed up a little bit, you'll still be able to tell what letters its supposed to be and be able to read the entire novel. If it gets too messed up, you won't be able to read it at all but you can tolerate a little noise without losing anything. With the pictures, on the other hand, you start losing details as soon as it gets a little messed up.

Why do commercial buildings have flat roofs while residential buildings have sloped ones?,"The main reason is because it is more expensive to build a sloping roof, and it is not necessary for a residential building. It is more expensive because it requires more materials to build a sloping roof, and it requires more skilled workers to build it. The slope of the roof is to allow snow to slide off, which is not a concern in residential buildings. Commercial buildings are typically built with a flat roof, while residential buildings are built with a sloped roof. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it is more expensive to build a sloped roof, which is why you tend to see more residential buildings with flat roofs. Secondly, commercial buildings don't tend to have as much snow, so the slope of the roof is less important. Finally, commercial buildings are more likely to have a flat roof because it is easier to install things like HVAC equipment, solar panels, and other features on a flat roof.","The slope of something is defined as the height divided by the width. A roof needs to be at least a certain slope for snow to slide off of it (rain generally will slide off a gentle slope). This slope is easy to make if the roof is small. However, if the roof is commercial sized (large width) and you want the same steepness throughout, you will end up with a VERY TALL slopped roof (large height). It's just not feasible. Secondly, the amount of material needed to cover a flat roof is less than for a sloped roof (the flat side of a rectangle is always smaller than the diagonal). When you need to cover a lot of roof area in commercial buildings, price becomes a factor. Next, a flat roof allows you to put things on there. Air conditioners and other ventilation systems are much larger for commercial buildings compared to smaller ones and generally they are placed on the roof. These would be very difficult to install on a sloped roof. Lastly, depending on the weather, a flat roof is fine. If it doesn't rain or snow much a flat roof will do. A sloped roof just looks more pleasing on a house (and it can add attic space) so residential houses have them simply to increase property value. So there could be several reasons, I can think of 3 off the top of my head. 1: Residential buildings have attics for storage. 2: Having an attic allows for more insulation, since a house has to be heated pretty much 24/7, while a school only really needs to be heated 8-12 hours a day. 3: As a home owner it's easier to replace a patch of shingles or even replace all your shingles in the event your house had some damage. But a flat roof requires a thick and heavy layer of tar to seal it from water damage. This usually needs special equipment and professional insulation.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.59, 'recall': 30.15, 'fmeasure': 40.48}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.4, 'recall': 8.98, 'fmeasure': 12.07}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.49, 'recall': 14.93, 'fmeasure': 20.04}}"
How do manufacturers make artificial flavors taste almost exactly like the real thing!?," Purely from a chemistry perspective, flavors are made up of chemicals. Artificial flavors are created by isolating the chemicals that make up a natural flavor, then creating a synthetic version of the same chemical. For example, natural vanilla flavor comes from vanillin, a chemical found in the vanilla plant. Artificial vanilla flavor is created by isolating the vanillin chemical and then creating a synthetic version of it. When you eat the artificial vanilla flavor, your tongue recognizes it as vanilla flavor. The chemicals that make up a flavor are not necessarily the same as the chemicals that make up the natural flavor. For example, natural strawberry flavor comes from a chemical called dimethyl sulfate. Artificial strawberry flavor is created by isolating the chemical that makes up the strawberry flavor and then creating a synthetic version of it. When you eat the artificial strawberry flavor, your tongue recognizes it as strawberry flavor.","**TL;DR**: *They usually concentrate on including a very special family of chemicals called 'esters' that are at the core of the flavour they're trying to duplicate, and top it up with sweeteners that are so low in calories they can legally market them as having zero.* Flavours are caused by a mix of chemicals that affect two of your senses (let's ignore stuff like texture, as 'crunch' or 'chewy' is not a flavour.) There's stuff that affects your taste and that your tongue picks up, like salt or sugar. And there's stuff that you smell and that your nasal passages pick up, like the smell of food cooking or that freshly cut pear. Both of them combined are released when you bite and chew, and that's why a good steak tastes stronger it smells. *(**Sidebar eli5**: when you have a cold and your nasal passages are all frigged up, you lose this second sense and that's why food is often more tasteless when you're ill.)* You usually only need a small trace of the latter type of nose-friendly chemical to influence the flavour of food, and certain chemicals are really strongly associated with certain foods. These are often 'esters', a complex chemical that our nose picks up and we know is quite distinctive. Bananas have one ester, oranges another, and some fruits like strawberries have a bunch that give a new smell when combined. Duplicate that chemical or mix in the lab, or get even close to it (for example, by using orange squash to flavour orange soda), and you have your flavour. Because only traces are required to make a food taste like a pineapple, they have essentially zero calories until you start adding sugars and other stuff to make it ""tongue friendly too"". And by adding artificial sweeteners or natural stronger sweeteners like Stevia that have a lot less calories than sugar, you can keep the calorie count so low that it's okay legally to say ""this product has 0 calories"". A chemical is a chemical. The source of it doesn't make it ""real"" or ""not real"". If there was a good tasting plant that derived its flavor from a complex of Fluorine, Uranium, Carbon, and Potassium, it would be no different than making that same complex in a chemical factory.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 49.67, 'recall': 19.04, 'fmeasure': 27.52}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.67, 'recall': 3.31, 'fmeasure': 4.79}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.84, 'recall': 9.14, 'fmeasure': 13.21}}"

Why do we screw clockwise and unscrew counter-clockwise?," Pertaining to the screws, screws are a mechanical fastening device that uses friction to hold materials together. The thread on the screw is designed to mate with a matching thread on the receiving material, which is called the ""nut"". The nut is designed to be tightened by turning the screw. As the screw is turned, the thread on the screw engages with the thread on the nut, which causes the nut to be tightened. The reason that the screw is designed to be tightened in a clockwise direction is that it allows for the nut to be tightened evenly. If the screw was unscrewed in a counter-clockwise direction, it would be difficult to control the direction of the screw, and the screw may become stripped or damaged. It is also possible that the screw may be stripped or damaged if it is unscrewed in a counter-clockwise direction. This is because the threads on the screw are designed to mate with the threads on the nut, which are designed to be tightened in a clockwise direction. If the screw is unscrewed in a counter-clockwise direction, the threads on the screw may not be able to mate with the threads on the nut, which may cause the screw to become damaged or stripped.  ","There's two ways I believe your question can be interpreted, and I'll start with the easier, more concrete one to answer. If you're asking why there aren't screws that tighten clockwise as well as counterclockwise circulating the market together, first off there are, but typically only for specialty items. But the main reason is just for uniformity. If both kinds were made, that would also mean that things such as bolts/nuts would HAVE to be paired with a nut/bolt respectively that was made to fit it. A counterclockwise to tighten bolt would not fit a clockwise to tighten nut, the threads wouldn't line up, so companies would have to have two machines instead of one to make their product. This is irrelevant to screws going into wood, but uniformity would dictate that it should be the same direction as with bolts. Now, the way I believe you're intending your question is why is it the standard that it's clockwise to tighen and counterclockwise is to loosen, instead of being standard to turn clockwise to loosen and counterclockwise to tighten, and although the answer to that isn't 100% certain, at least not to my knowledge, the predominantly accepted answer is that right-handed people can turn with a stronger force clockwise, so it was made uniform to tighten clockwise so a tighter grip could be made with the screw/bolt (because the vast majority of people are right-handed, sorry lefties). I have to imagine that for the predominantly right handed society, you have more muscle to pull something as apposed to push it. So it makes sense to screw things in towards your body. Plus it's been that way for so long that there's no valid reason besides personal preference or spite to actually change it.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 38.32, 'recall': 26.62, 'fmeasure': 31.42}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.1, 'recall': 4.23, 'fmeasure': 5.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.63, 'recall': 13.64, 'fmeasure': 16.09}}"

Why can't cars go reverse full speed ?,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""reverse full speed"", but I'll give it a shot. I'll explain it in terms of the car's gearbox. When you shift into reverse, the transmission changes to a different set of gears. The gears are designed so that the transmission is able to handle the torque of the engine, but also so that it can be easily reversed. When you shift into reverse, the transmission changes to a set of gears that are specifically designed to handle the torque of the engine going backwards. The transmission can't handle the torque of the engine going backwards at full speed, because it's not designed to. The gears in reverse are designed to handle the torque of the engine going backwards, but they are not designed to handle the torque of the engine going backwards at full speed. So, when you shift into reverse, the transmission changes to a set of gears that are designed to handle the torque of the engine going backwards, but it's not designed to handle the torque of the engine going backwards at full speed.","To go full speed cars have gears, first, second, third, fourth and often a fifth for economy on motorway driving. There is little point in having gears for going backwards because most people would feel uncomfortable reversing at 120 miles per hour. So it only has one reverse gear which is the equivalent of first gear. Most cars in europe would struggle to go 30 miles per hour in first gear (normal cars) so that would be the same limit on reverse speed for the same reason. Adding multiple reverse gears would add a lot of parts (and weight and cost). And there are very few usage cases where going fast in reverse could be justified. Some vehicles can. It is all a question of what gears you have. Since with normal cars you usually don't ever have a good reason to drive backwards at anything other than slow speed, most car-makers don't built them with more than one reverse gear. Some vehicles like Mercedes' Unimog have multiple backward gears 8 forward and 6 backward gears is something I have seen. This is usually not to drive backwards very fast but to give you different option of driving backwards slowly and very slowly because you are moving something incredibly heavy like a couple of train cars.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 33.51, 'recall': 29.22, 'fmeasure': 31.22}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.63, 'recall': 2.29, 'fmeasure': 2.45}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.28, 'recall': 15.07, 'fmeasure': 16.1}}"
Why do all big cities have a highway or series of highways making a circle around the center?,"'The idea of the circle is not a new concept in urban planning. In fact, the concept of the circle was first introduced in the 16th century by Leonardo da Vinci. He believed that a circle was the most efficient way to move people around the city. However, the idea of building a circular city was not popularized until the 19th century. In the 1800s, a number of cities were built with circular roads. One of the earliest examples of a circular city was the city of Portland, Maine. Portland was built in 1808 by a group of investors who wanted to create a city that was centered around a circular road. The idea was that the circular road would provide a way to move people around the city quickly and efficiently. The circular road was also seen as a way to reduce traffic congestion.

Rather than have them unnecessarily add to the traffic congestion, they can pass around the most crowded areas of town.

How do electronics switch things on and off?,"It's a combination of the transistor and diode. The transistor is used to switch on/off the flow of current to the circuit. It's essentially a switch that can control the flow of current to the circuit. The diode is used to control the flow of current to the circuit. The diode is essentially a one-way valve. It can only allow current to flow in one direction. The transistor and diode are both used in combination to create the switch. When the transistor is closed, the diode allows the current to flow in one direction, and when the transistor is open, the diode blocks the current from flowing in one direction. The transistor is a type of semiconductor device that can be used to amplify or switch electrical signals. It is made up of three layers of a semiconductor material, with each layer having a different electrical charge. The layers are known as the emitter, base, and collector. The emitter is the layer where the current enters the transistor, the base is the layer where the current is controlled, and the collector is the layer where the current leaves the transistor. The transistor works by creating a voltage difference between  , and a current flowing between  .

There are other components that can act as switches. Relays are an example. They use an electromagnet to attract a piece of metal and close a circuit. SCRs (silicon controlled rectifiers) are similar to transistors except that they latch on and stay on until the voltage through them drops below a threshold value.

So you're looking at choosing between 20, 30, or 40 rounds. 40 is just too much for standard use. It makes the magazine stick down too far to shoot from prone (a 30 round AR-15 mag sits almost even with the bottom of the pistol grip), and it makes the rifle too heavy (especially something like the steel magazines in a 7.62x39 AK). 30 rounds is as many rounds as you can put in while not sacrificing pointability and the ability to carry it. Additionally, it is harder to actually put larger mags into loadbearing equipment- especially something like a large curved 7.62x39 magazine. Look at the large RPK mags and imagine trying to carry a lot of them on your chest as a rifleman. As an aside, notice that larger full power rifles like the FAL more commonly used 20 round magazines because for them, a 30 round magazine was too heavy and large for standard issue. For a rifle in an intermediate caliber with a box magazine on the underside of the receiver 30 cartridges is about the most you can fit in the magazine and still be able to fire the rifle comfortably from a prone (laying down) position. If the mag is too long it forces you to hold the rifle higher off the ground, which makes it difficult to shoot comfortably and accurately.

How does an automatic transmission work?,"In a manual transmission, the engine is connected to the transmission through a flywheel, which is connected to the transmission through a clutch. When you press the clutch pedal, the clutch disengages the flywheel from the transmission, and the engine and transmission are no longer connected. This allows you to shift gears. When you press the clutch pedal again, the clutch engages, and the engine and transmission are connected again. The transmission has gears that are connected to the engine, and the gears allow you to change the speed of the engine. In an automatic transmission, there are no gears that are connected to the engine. Instead, the transmission has a torque converter, which is connected to the engine and the transmission. The torque converter is like a fluid coupling, and it allows the transmission to transfer power to the wheels. The torque converter is connected to the engine through a bellhousing, and it is connected to the transmission through a transmission housing. When you press the clutch pedal, the torque converter disengages, and the transmission is no longer connected to the engine. When you press the clutch pedal again, the torque converter engages, and the transmission is connected to the engine again.  ","Manual transmissions are quite basic. You have an input shaft with gears on it that turns and an output shaft with different sized gears on it and clutches to select which one you want to change the gear ratio. Stuff can be spaced out and there are limited parts In an automatic transmission you have planetary gear. There is a large gear in the middle (sun gear), a big ring gear(ring) on the outside, and smaller gears(planets) that connect the ring to the sun. Gear ratios are changed by choosing which gear is the input, which is output, and which is locked in place. All of these gears are packed together and a modern automatic could have up to 4 sets of planetary gears resulting in lots of parts, all of which are covered in oil. Transmissions have a rather low rate of problems and a rather high skill requirement to properly fix which results in there being few shops being willing or able to work on them which drives up the price I think this question is better answered by watching a youtube video explaining all the basics.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 29.56, 'recall': 31.41, 'fmeasure': 30.46}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.46, 'recall': 4.74, 'fmeasure': 4.59}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 16.75, 'recall': 17.8, 'fmeasure': 17.26}}"
"Why can't we fly a plane as high as it can go and launch a rocket off the back of it, using less fuel and weight, plus using the momentum it already has with the plane? Kinda like a giant missile to space.","A plane has a very low thrust to weight ratio. That means that the thrust of the engines (the force that propels the plane forward) is very small compared to the weight of the plane. To get a plane off the ground you need to accelerate the plane to a high enough speed that the plane will start to lift off the ground. This is done by using the engines to generate a large thrust relative to the weight of the plane. Once the plane is airborne, the plane will start to slow down as the plane's weight is reduced by the air. As the plane slows down, the plane will start to lose lift and eventually the plane will stall and fall to the ground. So if you want to take off in a plane, you need to have a high thrust to weight ratio. This is one of the reasons why a rocket is a much better way to get to space. A rocket has a much higher thrust to weight ratio than a plane. This means that a rocket can accelerate a large mass to a high speed in a much shorter distance than a plane. This is why rockets are used to launch satellites into space.  ","We can but it is not terribly practical. In very rough terms lowest possible orbital speed is about 25,000 km/hr. A rocket achieves that by throwing mass out the back and letting conservation of momentum do its thing. The difference between a rocket and an (airbreathing) jet engine is that all the propellant mass has to be aboard at the beginning of the flight to accelerate not just the payload but, at earlier stages of the flight, all the rest of the propellant too resulting in the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. As a result, the F9 requires about 500,000 kg of fuel to raise 20,000 kg to LEO. An extremely fast aircraft (SR-71) might achieve 4000 km/hr with a few hundred kg of payload and mid-air refueling. A B-2 goes about 1000 km/hr with about 18,000kg payload (again with mid-air refueling). Now if you look at the numbers above you can see that, from a speed perspective, a jet aircraft is roughly stationary compared to an orbiting spacecraft. You can also see that a rocket small enough to be carried by a B-2 would only be able to lift a few hundred kg to orbit and that it doesn't make much difference (at least in terms of momentum) whether you launch that rocket from the surface, from a balloon or from a jet aircraft. It is called Pegasus and run by Orbital ATK They have been doing it for awhile URL_0 Here is a recent launch URL_1 Because the plane adds almost nothing to the momentum of the rocket, and because the planes we have are too small to give a significant payload to the rocket once you factor in the need to load it up with close to the same amount of fuel as you would in a normal launch. The hard part isn't getting to orbit, but getting a high enough speed to maintain that orbit. For example, the Space Shuttle had to hit 17,500 mph relative to Earth's surface; putting it on top of a plane would have only accounted for the first few 500 mph or so, and would have severely compromised the payload. Granted, you can try to get the plane moving faster, as what you're talking about has *some* merit, but the US hasn't tried anything like what you're suggesting since the [MD-21 incident]( URL_0 ). You would still need so much fuel and such large rockets that there are no planes even close to big enough to do what you are suggesting. It would take a truly massive plane to make this work. That's what we (Firefly Space Systems) were trying to do. The advantages of an air launch means there is a lot lower max Q during the launch so a lot less stress of the vehicle, the ability to launch anywhere and not be tied to a launch pad, and faster turn around between launches. The downside to launching any sizable vehicle is weight. Do you plan on launching something small like a Pegasus (do-able) or a Falcon 9 (impossible) from a plane? Our rocket was designed completely with carbon fiber to reduce weight, and even with that, we needed the largest plane to ever be build in order to do that (Stratolaunch). A transport plane might get to roughly 500 mph with a rocket strapped onto it. The velocity needed to exit Earth's orbit is around 17500 mph. That's less than 3% of what it would need. You'd also have to make the plane really powerful and the rocket very small and light-weight to even be able to lift it off the ground.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 65.88, 'recall': 22.06, 'fmeasure': 33.06}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.14, 'recall': 5.72, 'fmeasure': 8.58}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.75, 'recall': 10.63, 'fmeasure': 15.93}}"
Why are turbulences harmless for a plane? What's the physics behind that?,"Turbulence is caused by air moving at different speeds and in different directions. It's not a single, solid wall of air that you can hit, it's more like a big mess of air that's all over the place. Planes are designed to fly through turbulence, it's not a problem for them. Turbulence is actually a very normal and natural thing that happens in the atmosphere. The air is always moving, and sometimes that movement is more or less turbulent. Turbulence is just the movement of the air in the atmosphere that is more than the normal amount that we're used to. There's a lot of different reasons why it happens, but one of the main reasons is when a warm air mass and a cold air mass meet. The warm air is less dense than the cold air, so it rises up to meet the cold air, which is denser and sinks down. This creates a movement of air, which is what we call turbulence. This is the same thing that happens when you boil water, the bubbles are the air rising up out of the water. Turbulence is a normal thing, and it's not a problem for planes.  ","Simply put, the small bumps are negligible and the plane is strong enough to ignore it. Strong enough turbulence can do damage, but that's uncommon (they don't normally fly through the worst weather). What is turbulence? It's air that is flowing in a turbulent way, there's no smooth movement and it moves in eddies and abruptly changes direction. This jerkily-moving air literally just jostles the air about. This is contrasted with laminar flow, which is smooth and in nice neat layers. Think of water in a pool. If you move your arm through it when it's undisturbed you glide smoothly, if everyone near you is splashing you'll hit places where the current is moving with your arm and places where its against your arm so your arm gets pushed and pulled about more.

A battery is a number of electrolytic cells connected together, almost always to increase the voltage. In this case, six 1.5 volt cells are joined to give the 9 volts. Strictly speaking, 1.5 volt ""batteries"" such as ""double As"" are just cells and shouldn't be called batteries at all. Popular usage over the years has changed the meaning. In the early days of electronics everything used vacuum tubes (AKA valves) which needed much higher voltages than transistors and so batteries, as opposed to cells, were much more common. Battery is used in the same sense for batteries of guns, i.e., a group of guns working together. Cells tend to be round because a cylinder is the most efficient way to arrange the metals and electrolyte. For a 9 volt battery, since each cell in the stack is relatively flat, the efficiency of a cylindrical shape is less important so it's worthwhile to push the battery into a rectangular shape to make it easier to fit inside compact electronic devices.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 25.69, 'recall': 28.0, 'fmeasure': 26.79}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.69, 'recall': 4.02, 'fmeasure': 3.85}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.3, 'recall': 14.5, 'fmeasure': 13.88}}"
Why is it so hard for road workers to set manhole covers flush with the road surface?,"Because the cover is not the same size as the hole.

"Why haven't we been able to make leafblowers, etc silent / much quieter?","... I'm not sure. I don't think it's a problem of technology, but rather a problem of economics. If you make a leaf blower that is 100% silent, it's going to be a lot more expensive than a regular leaf blower. And if it's that expensive, who's going to buy it? If you're going to make a leaf blower that's 95% as effective as a regular leaf blower, and it's 20% more expensive, then it's a no-brainer. But if it's 95% as effective, and it's 50% more expensive, then you're not going to sell any. The reason that leaf blowers are so loud is because they need to be powerful enough to move a lot of air, and to do that they need to use a big motor. And big motors are loud. If you want to make a leaf blower that's 100% silent, you're going to have to make it a lot smaller. But if it's smaller, it's not going to be able to move as much air. So you're going to have to make it even smaller, and then it's going to be really expensive, and it's going to be really ineffective.","The noise occurs where the high speed exhaust starts mixing with the low-speed ambient air. Basically, the jet of air coming out of the blower needs to puncture through and rub against all the rest of the air. That causes friction and turbulence, which causes noise. There are some things you can do to improve the noise *quality* (see the [chevrons]( URL_0 ) on new aircraft engines), but reducing the overall noise level is generally only possible by reducing the speed difference between the exhaust and the ambient air; that is to say, turn the leaf blower off. It's not that we *can't*, it's that it *drastically* increases the price without largely impacting the ability to do the job. People who are leafblowing would rather spend $200 for a loud cheap one than spend $450 on a silent one. Actually the noise of leaf blowers and lawn mowers comes from the motor or engine, and whether electrical or gasoline-powered, they need to concentrate a lot of power into a generally small engine or motor. Power generates heat, so the motor or engine needs quite a bit of air flow to cool it down, and this makes it somewhat difficult to add padding or insulation that would absorb and lower the noise. You CAN find quieter devices, but you have to specifically look for noise ratings rather than performance ratings, so they're both more expensive and under-performing.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 33.18, 'recall': 29.22, 'fmeasure': 31.07}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.51, 'recall': 6.61, 'fmeasure': 7.03}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.22, 'recall': 16.05, 'fmeasure': 17.07}}"
Do heat-seeking missiles ever accidentally lock onto the sun?,"It is not uncommon for heat-seeking missiles to have difficulty tracking targets that are not moving. The heat-seeking missile is designed to track a heat signature, and the heat signature of an object that is stationary is not very different from the heat signature of the sun. As such, the heat-seeking missile will have difficulty distinguishing the sun from the target. However, this is not a problem for the military, because the heat-seeking missile is designed to be able to track a moving target. If the target is stationary, then the heat-seeking missile will be unable to distinguish it from the sun, and it will not be able to hit the target.","Usually, a heat-seeking missile has been programmed to change its trajectory based on various things, and so it can usually tell if it's detecting the sun (or, for example, infrared light from the sun scattered off of clouds) or if it's detecting its actual intended target. Compared to a person or a vehicle, the sun outputs a very obvious signal in infrared, since it's pretty much always going to be the same level of infrared light and in the same shape, provided it isn't getting partially obscured by things. If a missile simply ignores the brightest source of infrared light (or, if it's searching for super-heated jet engine outputs, ignores anything less bright than that) if it appears to be the size and intensity of the sun, it wouldn't be tricked by the sun. Of course, it isn't always going to be perfect, and there are conditions where the missile will mistake various things for its target - clouds, heat from sandy ground, and so on. Better and better technology and imaging techniques helps to mitigate this. The most sophisticated heat-seeking missiles basically make an infrared image of the surroundings and analyze it. Of course, even that isn't going to be perfect, yet. That's why we use ""identify the pictures that have signs in them!"" as ways to prove you're not a robot - computers are pretty bad at correctly interpreting visual data. Yes, this is actually a known problem with primitive heat-seeking missiles, and pilots would occasionally try to get between the missile and the sun in order to transfer the missile's focus onto the sun. Modern missiles are specifically programmed to avoid this.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 56.41, 'recall': 22.92, 'fmeasure': 32.59}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.79, 'recall': 5.57, 'fmeasure': 7.94}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.06, 'recall': 11.81, 'fmeasure': 16.79}}"

If you want to build a fence, you want to make sure it is on your side of the property line, otherwise your neighbor can tear it down if they like. You call a surveyor, they will review the property records, and so you exactly where the line is. Or maybe you are building a new shopping complex. You bought the land, you have decided where to put all the buildings, roads, and parking lots, and now you need someone to take those plans and put stakes in the ground so the builders build in the right place. The equipment lets them do this. The property records/building plans will reference some known landmark or coordinates. The surveyor starts there, sites their instrument in the correct direction, then measures off a certain number of feet, according to whatever they are working off of. Eventually, the set markers in all the key locations so the next people to come along know where everything belongs. Land surveyors measure and record where things are on the surface of the earth. Usually in relation to a known geodetic grid. They also layout for new construction, such as roads, buildings, and even parking lots. As a former instrument operator, the instrument is usually called a total station, and it performs many tasks, such as measuring angles, elevation, as well as distance. The more common instruments can collect data, but that is usually done on a handled unit almost like a scientific calculator with special programming and memory that allows points to be stored, calculated, and even uploaded for laying out on the ground. Once a given point on the earth is known, the surveyor can then follow calculated angles and distances to get where they need to be to layout whatever it is they are tasked to do that day. Sometimes it is just about recording where something is, so that the civil engineers know where it is and are able to incorporate that into whatever they are working on. Things like houses, fences, curb and gutters, streets, utilities, drainage inlets and outlets, as well as any other permanent structures that can't be moved.

Why are pistol bullets usually wider than rifle bullets?,"The same reason that a pistol has a different caliber than a rifle. Pistols are generally chambered in smaller calibers, such as 9mm or .45ACP, and rifles are chambered in larger calibers, such as .223 or .308. The smaller calibers of pistols are necessary to achieve the same level of power as a rifle with a larger caliber because pistols have much less space for the bullet to expand. The expansion of the bullet is what creates the energy behind the bullet, so the bullet must be able to expand in order to be effective. Pistols have much less space for the bullet to expand because of their small size, so the bullets are designed to expand in order to create the same level of power as a rifle.","Bullets have both length and width that contribute to their volume, and therefore weight and power. In a rifle, the magazine can generally be whatever dimensions are convenient for the designer to make them. For a handgun however, the magazine goes inside the grip, and so must fit within a human hand. This restricts the forward-to-back dimension of the cartridge so that pistol bullets need to be short and stubbier than rifle bullets to fit. In order for the bullets to stay big, they just make them wider to compensate. On another point, because the case, and therefore powder volume of a rifle is so much larger, rifle bullets tend to go close to 3x as fast as a handgun bullet. Even so, at the extreme ranges that a rifle is used, the bullets can fall over 3 feet, making it important to keep that velocity up. Lower bullet mass and narrower bullets help with that. Since a handgun is so much more difficult to shoot accurately, its not really important that it's terribly effective past a few tens of meters. Thirdly, since the bullets move slower, (this is a little controversial) it has fewer mechanisms for wounding. Rifle bullets will send a shockwave through flesh, damaging organs even far away from the wound channel. Handgun bullets are slow enough that they don't really do that. In order for an organ to get damaged by a handgun bullet, the bullet has to actually pass through it. Making the bullet wider increases this chance. TL;DR Handgun bullets need to be short to fit in the grip, they are slow because they don't need range, and they are wide so that they still have adequate wounding potential at low energy. With a rifle's intended long range, bullet speed is important -- and a heavy but slow-moving bullet may not reach its distant target. So they use a moderate-weight bullet with a relatively large explosive charge. Rifles using a large bullet, then, require a *very* large explosive charge, making them harder to handle and heavier. Also, pistols don't have a lot of length in the chamber simply because they are compact, so a wider rather than longer bullet is the way to add mass.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.47, 'recall': 20.53, 'fmeasure': 30.65}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.28, 'recall': 4.49, 'fmeasure': 6.71}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.91, 'recall': 9.47, 'fmeasure': 14.15}}"

Beyond that, it's very useful for developing technology for space travel in a *relatively* safe but useful environment. The ISS is build with a lot of locks in place which means that a problem in one area can be isolated. This way they can send up test functions and see if they work ""in situ"" (rather than in a lab on earth), safe in the knowledge that if the worst comes to the worst the astronauts aboard can jump into their Soyez and get the hell out. One example of this is the Bigelow inflatable module, which is basically a giant balloon that's stuck to the side of the ISS. This may later be used for long-duration missions (for example to Mars) so that the astronauts have a lot more space for the journey without being limited by the size of what they can send up there (because it's inflated in space). Thirdly, it enables us to study the long term impacts of low gravity on the human body. One thing we have learned is that the eyeballs actually change shape slightly after extended periods in low gravity. It's obviously better that we discover this in the relatively safe surroundings of Low Earth Orbit rather than, say, half way to Mars. Fourthly, the *international* part of the ISS has three major benefits: i) It fosters international cooperation between countries that haven't always seen eye to eye. ii) It keeps the costs down for all the countries involved, who have access to a large space that they either couldn't afford normally or would eat up a larger part of their budget due to the pooling of resources and iii) It enables smaller countries to develop their own space technology and concentrate on small, specialised areas that, developed on their own, would be pointless. For example, the ESA - the combined European Space Agency - contributed (amongst other things) a supply vehicle (the ATV) to the ISS, which sent up supplies. This vehicle would have been largely useless without the ISS, as it would have no where to go and the ESA could not really afford (or justify) their own space station. This vehicle, however, it being incorporated into NASA's Orion space craft which will (all things going well!) go to Mars at some point. So, by being part of the ISS, the ESA is able to gain this specialism and experience in space travel it wouldn't otherwise get. Research.

Why is there no market for transportation that fits between a normal city car and a motorcycle?,"There is, but it's not as big as the market for cars and motorcycles. It's called a scooter.

You spend 30-45 minutes driving to and from work. The rest of your day, the car sits unused. The solution is not smaller vehicles. The solution is moving away from the concept that each individual needs a _dedicated_ vehicle. In the past, the challenge to this has been that the most efficient way to get a vehicle _when you need it_ has been to own a dedicated vehicle, and one that is large enough for your most common needs. You may only have one person in it when commuting to work, but taking the family of five to the park on Saturday requires all the seats. Technology will solve that in two ways: 1. By dispatch technology that can match the person needing transport with the nearest available appropriate vehicle of the appropriate size to transport them.

By driverless technology that makes the matching of rider and vehicle not dependent on the needs of a human driver. Driverless technology also has the advantage of being more efficient, i.e. vehicles in dedicated-driverless lanes can all be communicating with one another, which will allow them to drive just a foot or two apart like a train, and slow down or accelerate all at once. Ever been in a long line of cars at a red light, the light turns green, then the first car accelerates, then the second, then the third, and so on, until by the time the car in front of you accelerates, the light has turned red again? Driverless cars don't have to behave like that because they could be in constant communication -- the light turns green, they _all_ move forward at the same time with the same acceleration. Matter of fact, if you can get human drivers off the road entirely, you don't even need stoplights (at least not for vehicular traffic -- you still need them for human pedestrians). Such technology reduces the overall number of cars on the road. In this scenario, cars might even become bigger and more luxurious, because the primary reason cars have been shrinking in size over the last 50-70 years is to reduce weight to reduce fuel consumption, which is only a problem because of the dedicated-vehicle model.

Why Dixon Ticonderoga pencils can erase better than other pencils.,"Pencils are made of graphite and clay. The graphite is the writing part, and the clay is the eraser. The graphite and clay are mixed together in a certain ratio, and then heated in a kiln to create a pencil. The ratio of graphite to clay affects how well the pencil erases. Dixon Ticonderoga pencils have a high ratio of graphite to clay, so they have a lot of graphite in them, which makes them very good at erasing. This is the only pencil I know of that can erase with a whiteboard eraser. I think the ratio is 4:1 or something like that. They also use a special type of clay that makes them softer. It's more like a putty, and it's soft enough to erase easily, but hard enough to make a sharp point. That's why they're so good for drawing and shading, and why they're so good at erasing.","You kids should stop playing with rubbers. Serious answer, it has to do with the composition of the rubber. I've noticed that the rubber on those erasers rolls off it into little cylinders. This is important because it increases the surface area of the rubber. Imagine wiping up a desk with a Clorox wipe. You use one side until it's black. What do you do? You flip it over and use the other side! The rolling effect of the rubber flips the dirty side and the clean side, and because the rubber is strong enough to remain connected to itself, you can roll those little suckers around and wipe up your mistakes! On other lower quality erasers, the rubber doesn't quite hold together and just kinda breaks apart and disintegrates(not a literal disintegration, but it gets the point across). Now you have all these tiny itsy bitsy chunks which in theory have more surface area than the cylinders from before because they can use their sides and front and back and top and bottom, whereas the cylinders can only use front and back. Buuuuut, because the chunks break apart and scatter (and because there is no compression force acting upon them) they don't do shit. They don't have the structural integrity to withstand the pressure you are applying to them, so they they turn into dust and make it even more difficult to erase things.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 37.34, 'recall': 24.48, 'fmeasure': 29.57}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.46, 'recall': 2.92, 'fmeasure': 3.53}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 16.46, 'recall': 10.79, 'fmeasure': 13.03}}"

"How does a ""dead man's switch"" work?","The idea is that if the switch is flipped, it is a sign that the person who flipped it is no longer alive. This is usually used on things like construction sites, where a single person can be responsible for a lot of equipment, and if they were to get hurt, it would be very hard to get all of the equipment shut off.

So if he dies he can't enter the password and the information gets leaked after a period of time automatically. Usually a dead man's switch, when used in the context of machinery its something you need to actively and consciously do to keep everything running. If something happens to the user, they can't do it anymore. Unlike an accelerator where you could pass out while leaning on it. Trains use a button that needs pressing regularly, but not just held in, so if something happens to the driver, they can't press it anymore and the train emergency stops. Despite the name, it doesn't have to be a ""dead man"", the train case is more for drivers just having a nap than anything! In Snowden's case, or anything else to do with computers, it's likley as /u/Fishandchips321 said. If he hasn't checked in, for whatever reason, the automatic processes will kick in. You can give a document to a lawyer and pre-pay for him to post that information upon an event. Keep the document sealed. If you're up against people that will go to quite extreme lengths, tell lawyer 1, ideally from a different country, to give the letter to lawyer 2 BUT NOT TELL YOU WHO LAWYER 2 IS - and for him to tell lawyer 2 to follow the above instructions (then take his money and walk away). That way if you're caught and tortured you still don't know who has got your 'reveal all' letter - poised and ready to post (well, possibly 30 letters, ready to post to a county-barrel load of respectable media outlets). And whomever is after you and the information suppression has the prospect of kidnapping and torturing innocent lawyer #1 who are in a different country - to add into the mix if they want to go with a black-bag operation - an unholy nightmare of a task! you basically set up a program that executes unless it gets a signal that it shouldn't every X hours. These days you can rent servers in the cloud pretty anonymously. So you do that, upload your dangerous data there, hook it up to a script that uploads the data to... wherever, pirate bay or something. and set it to do that in 24 hours. Now you have a deadman switch, the script will upload the data unless you log in to the server, and reschedule the task. There is a person, or an organization that is instructed to leak that information upon Edward Snowden being dead, or not heard of for X amount of time. Other types of dead man's switch are just holding a button pressed (or a pedal stepped on). If the person dies, they can't do that anymore and the train they are driving (or whatever) will automatically stop. Edward Snowden is not the only guy with access to all those secrets, but the only one sitting in the lime light. So when the shit hits the fan and Snowden gets assassinated, another guy will step forward and eventually continue Snowden's work or to disclose all information at once - no matter how destructive the outcome. There are three options for a Dead Man Switch: 1. Mechanical. You need to constantly or once-in-a-while press button or else something happens. You find those not only in movies, but also in trains: The driver has to press some pedal in short intervals or the train stops. 2. Computerized. You need to log into a certain service once in a while or something happens. You find those not only in movies, but also in your homebanking or many other sites. If you are not active for a certain amount of minutes/days/weeks, you are automatically logged off. Snowden might have one of those. 3. Social. Either you need to call a person once in a while or, in the case of Snowden, that person basically watches the news or follows you elsewise and if nothing happens for a certain amount of time, something happens. Snowden might have one of those. I expect that Snowden actually has several of 3, it might be people he trusts or pre-paid lawyers in possibly different countries, instructed to become active should he get killed, arrested or simply vanish. This is way easier and more foolproof than you having to log in somewhere, the issue with ""trust"" is you do not know what happens if years go by or when your friends are pressured, using lawyers (even large law firms not based in the US) might mitigate this.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.87, 'recall': 10.51, 'fmeasure': 17.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.22, 'recall': 1.75, 'fmeasure': 2.99}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.78, 'recall': 6.01, 'fmeasure': 10.25}}"

Nuclear Fusion Reactors,"Nuclear fission is the splitting of an atom. In fission, the nucleus of an atom is split into two smaller atoms, releasing energy in the process. This energy is used to generate electricity in a nuclear power plant. Nuclear fusion is the opposite of fission. In fusion, two or more atoms are combined to form a single, heavier atom. This process also releases energy. In fusion, the energy is released in the form of light and heat, rather than the electricity used in fission. Fusion is more efficient than fission, but it's also much harder to achieve. Fusion reactions are much harder to achieve because they require extremely high temperatures. In fact, the temperature required to achieve fusion is so high that it can only be achieved in a laboratory setting. There are several different ways to achieve fusion in a laboratory setting, but the most promising method is to use a magnetic confinement system. In this system, the fuel is confined within a magnetic field. The fuel is then heated to extremely high temperatures, causing the fuel to split into two smaller atoms. The energy released from this reaction is then collected and used to generate electricity.  ","The part of the reactor that is 100 million degrees Celsius is plasma (the state of matter past air) and it is contained in a magnetic field. The magnetic field keeps the plasma from touching anything, which means it can only heat things up through radiating heat, which is a slow way to transfer heat (though at 100 million degrees it would transfer heat very fast even through radiation). Why this won't melt the reactor is how the reactor generates energy. Basically you flow a lot of water around the reactor to cool it off. The water boils into steam which turns a turbine. The turbine generates electricity. Now in the actual reactor they aren't using water, but a mineral salt that melts. This is the reason why the reactors do not have any material close to the fusion material. The reactor core is suspended in vacuum by magnets and will slowly release its energy to the surrounding cooling pipes in a controlled manner. The problem people are facing when designing these reactors is that either the core produce too much energy for the system to dissipate though power generation or there is not enough energy being produced to give a net gain in power generation. So people are working on slowing down the reaction rate so the energy can be safely harvested and power the strong lasers and magnets required to get the ignition to start. There is a proposal that have been out for quite a few years to build a massive fusion reactor from known technology. There are however a few problems. It would take the entire US government annual budget to construct one reactor, the power grid is not big enough to handle the output and the power requirements is not high enough to be able to use all the power. To solve the two last problems there are some well known chemical processes that use CO2 and converts it into oil using power. The problem is that these processes are very inefficient and you would typically only get 1% of the energy back. The reactor would still be able to produce more oil then Saudi Arabia even with the massive loss in efficiency.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.73, 'recall': 25.14, 'fmeasure': 32.69}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.07, 'recall': 3.79, 'fmeasure': 4.94}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.63, 'recall': 13.78, 'fmeasure': 17.93}}"
"If New Orleans is surrounded by man-made levees, then how was the city built below sea level hundreds of years ago?","Because it was built on higher ground, and the Mississippi River flooded and deposited soil there. It was also built on a natural mound that was already there. The mound was made up of sediment from the Mississippi River, and was a natural flood plain. This made it a good place for people to live. Over time, people built more and more houses and roads on the mound. Eventually, they built a wall around the mound to keep the water out. The wall was made up of dirt and rocks, and was called a levee. The wall kept the water out, and people were able to build a city there.","Not all of it is below sea level. The French Quarter, which is the part that was originally settled by the French, is several feet above sea level. It still has a levee or sea wall between it and the Mississippi River to protect it during river floods, but it generally does not go underwater during storms. Even during Hurricane Katrina the French Quarter stayed high and dry. The parts of the city that flood are those that were established after levee protection and/or the drainage pumps came into existence. The levees have been around for a surprisingly long time and the pumping stations started getting built in earnest in the early 1900's, which allowed the city to expand even further into what was previously swampland. (Here is a Wikipedia article on[ drainage in the city]( URL_1 ). It also includes a [map]( URL_0 ) showing elevation in different parts of the city.) Finally, the city is built largely on river sediment and we don't allow the river to flood its banks anymore. Because river sediment contains a lot of organic material, the ground is slowly sinking as the organic material in the sediment decays. This is called compactional subsidence and it is pretty bad in some parts of the city. There are some areas where you have to fill your yard in with river sand every year or so and you have to replace your driveway every few years because it will sink with the sediment but your house will stay at the same elevation (houses are built on pilings so they don't move). Hope that answers your question There are a few things. The biggest is that the city is subsiding, similar to what is happening to Venice in Italy. New Orleans is built on very moist, swampy land. Soil can act like a sponge and it increases in volume when it is wet, and decreases when it dries out. Man made changes on the Mississippi River and the delta, along with development and draining of the swampy land in the city proper, have caused the ground to literally sink beneath their feet. When in doubt read the NASA study I always say hehe. URL_0 It might surprise you to learn that this kind of action is going on all over rivers and coast lines around the world and it's very common even before we started changing the land to fit our needs. Coastline areas are always in a state of flux due to changes in river flow, sea levels, deltas and sand dumping at river mouths etc. One of the very first colonies in North America, Jamestown, was along side a river and that site is now completely under water even though it wasn't developed or changed much as we grew our cities. The wikipedia article mentions "" In the early 1900s, a seawall was constructed with the intention of preserving the site around the original ""James Fort"", even though the actual location of the original 1607 fort was thought to be underwater and lost to erosion.

The crawler tracks are made of rubber or synthetic rubber and are designed to be able to move over uneven ground. They're like giant tires.

To do this, they use a mobile crane, but that's only good for the bottom, as mobile cranes generally aren't as tall as tower cranes can be.

So a car with a bigger engine will have more torque at the same rpm's and therefore accelerate faster.","An engine that is larger for a given horsepower will *usually* be less extremely tuned, and will usually last longer. As much as it is fun to engage in Jeremy Clarkson style bashing of old American engines that make 120 horsepower out of five liters, it's not beyond reason to tune those same engines to make 400-500+ horsepower. They also tend to last longer when they aren't being stressed. 200 thousand miles isn't difficult to achieve on those old engines. Engine cc refers to an area of volume, the raw size that a particular part of the engine is. HP refers to how much actual power that engine can produce. So if an engine is built badly but is huge, it may have lower hp than an engine that is built well but is smaller. In the 60s there were 8000 cc engines being built that were so inefficient, a modern 1600cc engine actually has more pulling power than it. GENERALLY .. its easier for engineers to get a higher HP, the larger that bit of an engine described in CC is.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 36.21, 'recall': 11.35, 'fmeasure': 17.28}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.51, 'recall': 1.09, 'fmeasure': 1.66}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.14, 'recall': 7.57, 'fmeasure': 11.52}}"
How do car key-fobs work and why do we not see machines that can mass-spoof unlock signals like computer passwords?,"The key fob is a special kind of transponder. It is a small computer that stores a unique code and can transmit that code wirelessly. When you press the button on the key fob, it sends the code to the car, which then uses that code to unlock the car. The code is encrypted and sent in a special way that makes it very hard for someone to intercept and use. There are a couple of reasons why we don't see machines that can mass-spoof unlock signals like computer passwords. First, it is very hard to get the key fob to transmit the code wirelessly. It has to be very close to the car to do that. Second, it is very hard to intercept the code and then use it to unlock the car. The code is encrypted and sent in a special way that makes it very hard for someone to intercept and use. Third, it is very hard to make a machine that can spoof the key fob and unlock the car.

It takes a long darn time to send a trillion numbers at 13 guesses per second. modern keyfobs use a rolling code with trillions of possible combinations. even if you stood in a huge parking garage and rolled through codes at light speed youd take centuries to get even 1 car to respond. and then what? congratulations, you've unlocked the door, you could have managed that with a rock... there are easier ways anyway, sniff out a wireless key transmission and relay it outside to the owners car. with this method you can even start the car and drive it away.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 24.53, 'recall': 35.86, 'fmeasure': 29.13}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.69, 'recall': 8.33, 'fmeasure': 6.76}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 14.15, 'recall': 20.69, 'fmeasure': 16.81}}"

How does gyroscopic stability work on a tanks main gun.,"The gyroscopic stability is a stabilization system used to counteract the natural tendency of a gun to twist as it rotates. It works by using a gyroscope, which is a spinning wheel that is mounted on a gimbal. The gimbal is a pivoted mount that allows the gyroscope to spin freely in any direction. As the gun spins, the gyroscope spins along with it, and the force of the spinning gyroscope causes the gun to rotate in the opposite direction. This counteracts the twisting motion of the gun, and the gun is stabilized.","Gyroscopic sensors detect movement of the tank in 3 dimensions. Computers convert that information into movement of the tank barrel, and signal hydraulic systems to move the gun in the opposite direction.

The engine is the same, it's just the cylinders that make the difference. There are a few other factors, like the material of the pistons, the camshaft, etc.","A number of factors determine actual pitch and harmonics: RPM, the number of cylinders, engine and exhaust layout. RPM: This one's pretty simple, it's like playing two different keys on a piano. The V6 in an F1 car at 16,000rpm will sound roughly 2 octaves higher than your car with a V6 at 4,000rpm. Number of Cylinders: More cylinders means more explosions per second (higher pitch) being pushed out the tailpipe. That V12 Ferrari has a lot more cylinders firing per revolution at idle, then my 4 cylinder does. Layout: Depending on the type of engine, the layout of the cylinders will dictate different needs for the exhaust system. Essential, the air being moved away from the cylinders starts in individual pipes. These pipes need to join up in some way into one pipe and go out the exhaust. Depending on how the firing of the cylinders is timed, and how long each pipe is before they all join up, means that you might not be hearing the firing of each cylinder as it really happens. [This video]( URL_0 ) does a good job of showing how the lengths of pipes can cause the pulses coming down the exhaust to stack unevenly. Making the intervals between firings to appear uneven.

"In a manual car, is it wrong to use neutral to get up to speed when descending hills?","- It is not wrong to use neutral, but it is not the most efficient way to do so. When you are in neutral, the transmission is not engaged, so the car is not using its power to drive the wheels. When you are in gear, the transmission is engaged, and the car is using its power to drive the wheels. This means that when you are in neutral, you are losing power that you could be using to drive the wheels. - The other reason you might want to avoid using neutral to get up to speed on a hill is that it will slow you down on the way down. This is because neutral is not a gear that you can use to accelerate the car. - The best way to get up to speed on a hill is to use a lower gear, like second or third. This will allow you to accelerate the car and get up to speed faster. When you are in a lower gear, you are using more power to drive the wheels, which will allow you to go faster.","No, not necessarily ""wrong"" per se, but perhaps against practice. People will say if you are in neutral you will have to use your breaks more, which technically is true, however I think it's negligible. The only thing I would worry about is if it was a large hill, and you were coasting for a while, and then went to shift into a gear, unless you know your car really well, you could shift a gear too high or low, which could cause your engine to redline or struggle. In the end, its your car bro; you do you. First off, I don't think using your engine to ""save your breaks"" is a great idea. Brakes are made to be used and replaced, cheaply. Why would one opt to put additional wear on their engine internals? But speaking for myself, I like to stay in gear in case I need to accelerate or anything. Furthermore, I find it that when a car in neutral has accelerated and the engine is revving up on its own a little bit it's a tad more sloppy when you do finally schlap it into gear.

How do solar panels work?,"A solar panel is a panel of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity. The cells are made of a special material that converts light into electricity.

The battery stores the electricity, and the power grid distributes it to homes and businesses. Solar panels work by converting sunlight into electricity. The electricity is generated by the photovoltaic effect, which is the process by which light is converted into electricity. The photovoltaic effect is the process of converting light into electrical energy. Photovoltaic cells are the building blocks of solar panels.

They are made of a special material called silicon. Silicon is a semiconductor, which is a material that can conduct electricity. In a solar panel, the photovoltaic cells are arranged in a grid. Each cell has two electrodes, called the anode and cathode. The anode is the positive electrode, and the cathode is the negative electrode.  ","Think of electrons like kids at a waterslide. The flow of kids down the slide is like electrons moving through a wire. Now imagine that there is no ladder to the slide and only way to get to the top of the slide is for a big guy to throw them up one by one. They land on the slide instead of falling back onto the ground. The sunlight takes the role of the big guy. Each photon of light hits an individual electron, jumping it up. Instead of the electron falling back to where it was, it hits the other side of the solar cell and makes its way back via a wire, giving you flowing electricity. A common kind of solar panel is the photovoltaic cell, that is made of an n-type semiconductor and p-type semiconductor. When sunlight hits the n-type semiconductor, electrons pretty much jump out of it and try to make their way to the p-type semiconductor. However, there's a buildup of charge between the semiconductors that stops the electrons from moving directly across; instead, the electrons have to travel through an external circuit, which is how we get a current from it. These solar panels are good for anything that uses electricity. Solar heating panels are also a kind of solar panel, and they basically just heat water by shining light on it.

That steam rises through turbines who spin magnets in in an electrical field like the inside of a roll of copper wire. That creates the electrical current. Some people have done a good job of this but left out a couple important parts. A turbine is used to spin a rotor (think of something like a long axle) that is connected to the generator which actually spins the magnets in a copper field which creates the electricity. Historically these turbines have been mostly steam powered, where a power producer will burn something like coal, trash, or even byproducts of oil; use the heat from the burning to create steam. The steam runs through a series of blades attached to the rotor which spins the generator Present day, a lot electricity is created as part of a combined cycle. A combined cycle starts with a combustion turbine (oftentimes Natural Gas). A combustion turbine will take a fuel (NG) and compress it, burn it, and use the resultant heat escaping to push blades on a rotor, which is attached to a generator. The exhaust from 1-3 natural gas turbines then heats up steam which will power a steam turbine. *Apolitical commentary coming* This is largely why coal jobs are disappearing and likely won't ever come back. Natural Gas is easier/cheaper to extract from the ground, burns much more cleanly, and creates energy more efficiently due to the combined cycle. *Fun trivia* Everyone in the power industry pronounces the word 'turbine' as (ter-bihn) not (ter-bine). The word comes from the french word turbinem (ter-bihn-um), which meant swirling or spinning water, and eventually the /m/ fell off, leaving the word we use today. The hot water produces steam, which spins a turbine. This turbine is essentially identical to the alternator in a car, albeit at a much larger scale. It contains a stator, which is a stationary set of electrical conductors wound in tight coils around an iron core; and a rotor; a magnet that spins around the stator. By spinning the magnet around the coil, electricity is generated via the law of electromagnetic induction. In short, the moving magnetic field induces electrical current in the coil, which creates AC power. _Everything_ has electrons. ""Electricity"" is what happens when we force those electrons to _move_ by literally pushing them with magnets. So for your literal 5 year old, I'd suggest going to a pet store and looking at one of those trapped-ball cat toys. The ball is always there, but it just sits there until someone pushes it along. So a generator is a loop (well, many loops) of wire and a strong magnet (well many magnets). By moving the wire or the magnet (depending on the design, in modern generators we tend to move the wire loops) the magnet pushes the electrons in the wire. In ""AC"" -- ""Alternating Current"" -- the pushing is back-and-forth. The direction of the push alternates, because the magnets and loops are arranged to go from magnetic-north (which pushes in one direction) to magnetic-south (which pushes in the other) and then back again. Now since magnets push electrons, it turns out that electrons push back on magnets. This is that whole ""equal and opposite forces"" thing. So the electricity in a loop of wire from the power plant to my house and back is like a bicycle chain of electrons. Each electron pushes its neighbor just like the links of the chain move each other. So you move the pedals and the tire turns. (It's actually like having that captured ball toy being full of balls since only ""pushing"" happens, but from here on out I'll be using the chain to stand in for the crowded ball toy.) A motor in your house is like a generator. So much like a generator that in many uses they are interchangeable. When the power plant turns its generator the chain-of-electrons moves the motor in your house. But if that motor doesn't want to turn it pushes back and factually tries to slow the generator at the power plant. So like the bicycle chain, it's harder to pedal up hill because the wheel pushes back on the chain which pushes back on the pedals which makes your legs have to work harder. Same deal with generators. So who or what is doing the pedaling? Well we use falling water in dams; or we boil water with coal, oil, gas, or nuclear heat; or we use wind pushing against blades in windmills. As long as something is on the other end turning the pedals the electricity flows. This is also why turning things off saves energy. When things are off they are not pushing back, so its easier to turn the generator, which in turn means it takes less water, heat, or wind to keep things running. So one last side-thing about solar... Clearly there is no magnet nor is there anything spinning around, so WTF amirite? You know that thing when you are on a bike and you push the pedal a little then ratchet back then push the pedal again? You never turn the pedals all the way around but you keep adding just a little force then click back then add a little force? That's how solar panels work. Photons (packets of light) are very like electrons. They can push electrons around and create momentary ""electromagnetic"" forces as they arrive. And diodes and such can act like ratchets, where they only let the electrons move in one direction. Solar panels are just giant diodes. The electrons can only easily move from the front (sun-facing) side to the back side. The photons from the sun shove the electrons to the back of the panel. The only way they can get back to the front is by going the long way around through the wire. This produces a single-direction, non-alternating current, called a ""direct current"" or ""DC"". Just like a battery produces DC. So the force of any one photon moving any one electron is tiny... so the panels are made quite large and they work best in strong light. Just massive numbers of tiny events ratcheting electrons along one at a time. In the end, electrons push and get pushed. You find something that can push, be it photons or steam or falling water. You give it something to push against, like a turbine. You hook that to a magnet/coil deal so that the pushing translates from physical shove to electrical shove, and you pipe that shove into your house by using wires where it can shove motors. Or shove photons (LEDs) directly. Or shove its way through difficult wires, causing heat because the electrons are bumping into things (your electric fire, stove, etc). Or shove through thin wires that are also resisting the shove creating so much heat that that everything glows white hot (old fashioned light bulbs).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 66.67, 'recall': 5.21, 'fmeasure': 9.67}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.39, 'recall': 1.35, 'fmeasure': 2.5}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 43.01, 'recall': 3.36, 'fmeasure': 6.24}}"
what's the difference between a car that runs on diesel and another that runs on gasoline?,"]( URL_0 ) > The main difference is the way they burn the fuel. Diesel engines use compression ignition, which means the fuel is injected into the cylinder and compressed. The resulting high temperature ignites the fuel. Gasoline engines use spark ignition, where a spark plug ignites the fuel. This means that diesel engines typically produce more torque and power than gasoline engines, but they are also heavier and more expensive. Diesel fuel is also generally more efficient than gasoline. Diesel engines are also more durable and last longer than gasoline engines. Diesel fuel is also more energy dense, which means that it contains more energy per liter than gasoline. This means that diesel engines can travel longer distances on a single tank of fuel than gasoline engines. Diesel engines are also generally quieter than gasoline engines. Diesel engines also produce more pollutants than gasoline engines.","Diesel fuel engines use compression to create heat and pressure, which causes the fuel to ""autoignite."" Gas engines use a spark. Octane is a combustible liquid that gasoline is compared to. Octane is resistant to igniting under pressure, and the higher resistance to igniting under pressure gasoline has, the higher the ""octane rating."" Gas is bought at the pump with three different choices of octane rating. ""100 octane gas"" is gasoline that has the same resistance to igniting under pressure as pure octane. Cetane, on the other hand, is what diesel is compared to. Cetane ignites very easily under pressure. Diesel only comes from a pump in one cetane rating, (I believe) it's 27. Diesel fuel can preignite in a gas engine, causing it to ""knock."" (Pressure moving against the direction of the engine, breaking shit) while in a diesel engine, gasoline will not burn at all. Further, gasoline engines use (nowadays) fuel injection to spray for into the intake manifold, where the air and fuel mix before entering the engine, vs. a diesel engine which injects fuel at the height of compression. That's because, if diesel engines had a fuel system like gasoline engines do, the diesel fuel would ignite before the height of compression, and the engine would (at best) backfire and turn off, or at worst, knock hard and tear itself apart. Gasoline, on the other hand, will not ignite without a spark due to its high octane rating. Diesel fuel does have an octane rating, just as gas has a cetane rating, but they are both respectively very low.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.53, 'recall': 25.28, 'fmeasure': 32.76}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.09, 'recall': 4.92, 'fmeasure': 6.39}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.53, 'recall': 11.7, 'fmeasure': 15.16}}"

In order to keep the body stable, you have to use a pivot point. This is why most animals have their knees bent. If you were to try to walk on two legs without bending your knees, you would fall over. If you bend your knees, you can use the knee to provide a pivot point. The knee is a very stable joint, so you can use it to keep your body stable. This is why you can't walk without bending your knees.","I'm still an industrial electronics student but if I had to guess I would say that it is because when engineers program robots they are given a ""home position"" that the robot stays in. In this case the home position is the one that best allows the robot to react to varying conditions. Like if the robot were to step into a hole and the knees were locked straight it would have trouble being able to step down into the hole because that joint can't rotate any further. But if the knee is in the middle of its rotation then it can straighten to step down into the hole or rotate further to step up onto something. Basically it's the position that allows a robot to do as much as possible and as far efficiency goes we are still just getting the kinks worked out of getting a robot walking. So it's not the most efficient way to stand but it's the easiest. Has to do with the way they walk. It's called Zero-Moment-Point movement. Basically they position their legs, so that they do not produce any moment in horizontal direction, thus the robot cannot flip over. The drawback of the calculation behind this is that you cannot allow two axles to be co linear because then you have a singularity that you cannot calculate, because you then have two axles that could cancel out a momentum but you cannot chose which. The easiest solution is to forbid the joint to be stretched. Edit: To put it more ELI5: IF you have two axles that are in line the robot brain cannot chose which one should move in what direction to make the next step since they have the same direction. So they forbid them to be in line. Because they are trying to model them off humans, because our bodies have adapted to walking on two legs and the closer we get to mimicking that, the more functional they will be. As humans we actually do stand with our knees slightly bent. Try standing in one place with your knees locked. It gets very tiring very fast, and if you are in a very hot environment or thick clothing, you can actually pass out because of it. I don't know the exact reasoning but it was what they always told us in military school during stationary reward parades. And I saw many a person drop like a fly because they didn't listen and locked their knees.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.91, 'recall': 17.8, 'fmeasure': 27.34}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.72, 'recall': 3.52, 'fmeasure': 5.42}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.33, 'recall': 10.07, 'fmeasure': 15.47}}"

Why do we not harness the energy produced from workout equipment in a gym? Is that not the same as a wind turbine?,"Because it is not a reliable source of energy. There are a few things that make it less efficient than a wind turbine. 1. There are only so many people in a gym, and you can only fit so many treadmills, ellipticals, etc. So, there is a limited amount of energy that can be generated. 2. The energy you can generate is only going to be a fraction of what you put in. You can't generate 100% of the energy you use. 3. It's not a steady source of energy. You can't predict when a person is going to start using a machine. 4. It's not easy to harness. It would be difficult to set up a system to harness the energy from the machines. 5. It's not worth it. It would be expensive to set up and maintain.","A professional cyclist can produce about 400W of power with his legs during a stage in a race (like the Tour de France.) Sprinters can hit about 2000W during a short period of time. If you imagine a cyclist on the stationary bike at the gym, he can maybe produce 300W. If he rides for an hour, he is producing 0.3 kWhr of power. In my province, that's less than 2 cents worth of electricity. Because then I'm not doing it for me, now I want to get paid for my service that I'm providing. Mainly because the amount of energy is so small. You only produce around 200 Watts of energy while exercising vigorously, which means you'd have to work our for five whole hours just to produce 10 cents to 25 cents worth of electricity. [We do]( URL_0 ) There are many places that do this, but the problem is the rather large upfront cost. I actually thought this was a genius idea as a kid, funnily enough! As someone who's worked with a bunch of electrical engineers, there's a reason this hasn't been invented yet, and the reason why most arm-chair energy production concepts haven't been applied: the law of exergy efficiency. As others have pointed out, we exert quite a pathetic amount of energy during a workout. Not only that, but a certain amount of energy is lost during all energy conversions (in this case, kinetic to electrical). So, not only is a very low amount of usable energy expended, but an even lessor amount of electrical energy would be captured and stored. Then there's the massive expenditure in building gym equipment that converts kinetic energy to electrical and then store said energy into a central grid. There's a zillion different ways in which we can convert and store everyday energy expenditure that's otherwise lost, hence why the exergy efficiency formula was developed for thermodynamics to tell engineer's ""hey, this shit has a poor expenditure-to-return ratio, come up with something else"". The energy gained from the equipment in the gym wouldn't be worth the equipment cost. Think about how much gym equipment already costs, and how much of it is unused even at peak hours. If we were to assume that equipment was under 100% utilization with athletes working at full output, with 100% efficiency, we still could not expect more than about $0.05 per hour per machine in electricity output. Real numbers are likely to be a whole lot less than that, and would make the return on investment terrible.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.11, 'recall': 19.86, 'fmeasure': 29.98}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.09, 'recall': 2.94, 'fmeasure': 4.44}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.47, 'recall': 9.26, 'fmeasure': 13.97}}"
How does a gaming AI enemy work? How does it know to attack you or your friend in co-op?,"Џ How does a gaming AI enemy know to attack you or your friend in co-op?
In a game with a single player, the AI would be programmed to attack the player. In a game with multiplayer, the AI is programmed to attack the player it perceives to be the weakest link in the group. This is because the AI is programmed to try and kill you, and the easiest way to do that is to kill the player who is the weakest. This is why it is generally a good idea to have a good team in multiplayer games, as it will make the game more enjoyable and give you a better chance of survival.","It really depends on the game. Computers are dumb. They can't make decisions on their own, and can only follow instructions that were given to them. A very simple AI in a shooter might have instructions that say: If the player is visible and in range, shoot at the player. Otherwise, walk along a patrol route. This is a ""conditional statement."" The computer checks to see if the condition (player is in range) is true. If it is, an action (shoot at the player) is performed. If it isn't, another action (walk) occurs. You can add complexity by expanding the set of conditions that the AI reacts to, and providing actions. For example: If health is below 30%, find cover. Otherwise, if an enemy is visible and in range, shoot at the enemy. Otherwise, if the player is visible and out of range, run toward the player. Otherwise, if a nearby teammate is in combat, run toward the teammate. Otherwise, if a sound is heard, move toward the source of the sound. Otherwise, walk along a patrol route. The conditions are checked in order, and if any one of them is true, that behavior happens and the rest of the conditions are ignored. Conditions might also be nested inside of each other. You can add even further complexity by randomizing the behavior. Maybe each enemy has a ""bravery"" attribute that affects how much health they have to lose before seeking cover. Each enemy can also have its own method of selecting a target among multiple options. This can be either random or deterministic. A lot of MMOs are based on a ""threat"" mechanic, which calculates which player the enemy perceives as most dangerous. Others might attack whichever player is nearest. But finding a target is just another set of conditions. The more conditions you give an AI, the more complex its behavior can become.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.76, 'recall': 21.2, 'fmeasure': 31.02}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.7, 'recall': 3.17, 'fmeasure': 4.65}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 31.9, 'recall': 11.71, 'fmeasure': 17.13}}"

"what makes an airplane ""lightning proof?""","Airplanes are made of metal. Lightning is a massive electrical charge. When lightning strikes an airplane, the electrical charge will flow through the metal. In most cases, this is not a problem. The plane will conduct the electrical charge and the charge will be dissipated harmlessly. In some cases, the electrical charge will not be dissipated harmlessly. The charge will cause the metal to heat up. If the charge is strong enough, the metal can melt. This can cause the plane to crash. So, airplanes are made of lightning-proof metal. They are designed to conduct electrical charges. They are also designed to be strong enough to withstand the heat generated by the electrical charge. The metal is also designed to be able to withstand the electrical charge without melting.","Airplanes are almost all metal on the outside. They are hit by lightning all the time, but the current flows around the plane's skin and down to the ground. Some systems kick off, but the pilots switch them on again and make a note in the logbook for maintenance to check for damage. No big deal, but not ""lightning proof"". I'm not entirely certain if *all* aircraft have these, but many have ""Static dischargers"", small (relative to the aircraft) horizontal metal antennas scattered around the plane (usually on the wings) that the lightning will pass through because it's the path of least resistance. The frame of the airplane is also designed in such a way there's very little metal (from the outside ""shell"") contacting the parts on the inside. When a plane is hit by lightning usually it travels down the frame of the aircraft and out the static dischargers on the wings/tail (Path of least resistance), doing minimal to no damage to the aircraft itself, aside from usually destroying the discharger it left on. Now, having said that, **this isn't actually the function of the static dischargers**, it's actually (just as the name sounds) to discharge static from in/around the aircraft so the radio and navigation systems work correctly/more accurately. But, because of the nature of them, they tend to be where lightning also leaves the aircraft (and in turn, this usually damages the discharger). I suppose if you put aside the dischargers (I'm probably getting way too specific anyway), basically the big metal frame of the aircraft is usually in minimal direct-contact with the electronics inside, and thus as the lightning leaves through the path of least resistance it tends to avoid the electronics, and then usually leaves out a mounted antenna, light (rarely), or discharger and then back outside into the humid air to find its way to the ground. EDIT: Clarified it a bit. Surprised nobody has mentioned they essentially operate as a giant Faraday cage. The same reason you are safer in a car during lightning storm (no, it's not that the tires are rubber). Another thing to help with a lightning strike is that composite parts (fiberglass/carbon fiber) have a conductive coating under the paint to spread electricity through the panel. Lightning strikes happen all the time.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 51.54, 'recall': 16.92, 'fmeasure': 25.48}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.75, 'recall': 2.53, 'fmeasure': 3.82}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.46, 'recall': 9.34, 'fmeasure': 14.07}}"

These cars have low production numbers and variations can be made more frequently or tailored to each buyer. And at least based on their marketing, each car is unique, like a work of art. Factory cars by contrast offset the cost of the machinery and design through economy of scale. Everyone has the same thing. As with luxury cars in general, noone buys them for reliability, it only makes sense to own as long it's under warranty. Humans are not robots Humans are social beings Before automation buyers wanted absolute perfection. Not because perfection was better but because it was rare. After automation buyers want hand craftsmanship. Not because hand craftsmanship is better but because it is rare. Rare things are better because they are more desirable (just from being rare/exclusive). Desire creates status, status is important to social beings. Most of the answers in this thread cover different yet equally valid points, and certainly for the automotive industry they hold a lot of water. One thing I would like to point out is that ""handmade"" may not mean what you would assume. These days most of the time it's means that most of the assembly work is done by hand rather than robots. In modern luxury niche handed vehicles, the majority of what you see is production scale parts covered by hand with leather. Everything behind it will be made on a large injection moulding, milling, or casting scale. These days, ""handmade"" refers largely to the assembly method as opposed to the production method. It's there because as someone else mentioned, if you're making low volume high profit products it's hard to front the cash for big production systems, especially when you can use it as a selling point. If you can pay someone a low-medium hourly rate to assemble a car you can then sell for a higher price, why wouldn't you? Source: have worked for a number of years in the automotive world designing niche luxury (very fast) products. I can give my 2 cents here. I'm a robotics engineer for automotive companies. Also, I've been to where some Rolls are built. Very skilled workers are much better than robots in certain areas. I'm saying better in the sense of quality. I'll use an example I'm familiar with. It's applying sealer to various seams of the car where metal comes together. If you open your hood or trunk you can probably see some a bead of sealer around the edges. They're applied everywhere almost and on a Rolls they have to be absolutely perfect. Robots can do this but they are used for speed and quantity. Compared to a skilled human the seams a robot applies are just ok. Humans have an instant feedback loop that robots do not. Many variables like humidity, changing viscosity of material, metal fit tolerances affect the quality of the seam. Humans can feel it, see it as it's happening and adjust their application on the fly. A robot is just going to lay it down the same no matter what. Partly it's that some things cannot be done as well by robots as by a skilled person. Robots can make precise programmed movements, but they're less good at responding to their environment. When working with materials with natural variation like wood and leather, being able to use the individual pieces in the best way counts. Partly it's just that some buyers will pay a premium for something made in a more expensive way even if that more expensive way doesn't 'objectively' produce a better quality product. Work by a skilled person is valued in a way the output of a machine is not, and 'imperfections' can be seen instead as something that makes each individual car a little bit unique. You can get much more customization with a handbuilt car than an automated car. Rolls Royce prides themselves on creating cars that match what the buyer wants. They can put custom star constellations in the roof. They can find the exact materials you want for your seat. They can do custom stitching. Automation works best when you have limited variations, because each variation requires the automation to be designed to handle it. So it works great and can deliver extremely tight tolerances over and over again, but you can't go outside the designed variations. Robots are not more precise than a human. They're just more consistent. Engineering tolerances can be much tighter when something is hand built. On an automated line, the manufacturing tolerances are such that you can build a high volume of parts in the shortest amount of time possible while ensuring the least amount of fallout and downtime. Efficiency and cost trumps all. Design tolerances are relaxed to accommodate that throughput - and things like rattles and trim that doesn't fit just right is the result. The design philosophy behind a Rolls Royce is a bit different where manufacturing throughput and cost are not the primary design considerations. I can't speak to that, but I can say that in my experience, hand made shoes are far superior and last longer than machine made ones (In the US there are only 2 sizable companies that do this Alden and Allen Edmunds). Additionally, you can have them re-soled when the bottoms wear out. Robots are great at spot welding a frame together. However, they lack the finesse to install many of the interior parts. And when it comes to fitting doors, they're useless. Because metal expands & contacts during various stages of vehicle assembly, no two bodies are identical by the time the vehicle gets down the line to door fits. This must be done by human hands... and craftsmanship is key here. Source: I've worked in vehicle assembly for 23 years. Engineering tolerances. Generally speaking, automated production produces things within tolerances- machines shift over time, actuators might be slightly imprecise, etc. But the cars are designed to work within those tolerances so there's little human intervention needed to ensure that you have a car that works. When it comes to hand made cars, you have human oversight at every point checking, double checking, and even triple checking each little detail to ensure that everything is exactly correct. Because humans are capable of being self correcting in ways that typical automated assembly machines are not, it is possible (and only really achievable on the very high end cars) to produce a hand made car that exceeds the build quality of an automatically assembled car. However, really, these differences are minute, and not worth considering to the majority of car buyers. What hand made cars gets you is a very expensive car, because you have to make back all those man hours spent getting everything perfect. What makes all those cars more desirable are two things: 1: These cars are constructed as luxury cars, they have many little features and engineering tricks packed in that the average car does not. 2: These cars are status symbols, owning one marks you out as someone who is elite, affluent, powerful. It is a statement of wealth. ITT: a bunch of talk of robotics and engineering and shit. Real answer: if you're rich as fuck and can afford a Rolls-Royce, you're rich as fuck and can afford to take it to a service shop who knows how to service a Rolls-Royce. Because... if you own a Rolls-fuckin'-Royce, you don't take it to Midas for an oil change or a brake job. Because you're rich as fuck and you take your rich-ass car to a rich-ass shop so they can fondle your rich-ass balls and serve you rich-ass coffee while your rich-ass Rolls gets ITS rich-ass balls fondled. And rubbed with a diaper. You rich bastards. When you want to sell something at a high price, you know most people won't be able to afford it, so putting money into designing a factory to produce it can seem like a waste of money in itself, unless you have enough people ready to buy it. You don't want a surplus of super expensive cars. If you want to make something truly special, something that maybe, not everyone will buy, something that even people with lots of money won't buy, you can't just build a factory for it. You'll end up using it only a few times a year, even if the result is perfect. Making a robot costs a LOT of money. You can source most parts from other major factories, but the custom parts, the parts that make your car special and unique, you will find the cheapest way to make it is by hand vs making a precision robot to do it perfectly over and over again. You don't make a robot unless you plan to make a lot of something with it. Toyota sells 10 million cars in a year. Rolls Royce sells 4000 a year and that's a ""new record."" Most of the handmade cars have engines and big parts made in major automated factories, then they hand tune it themselves and make the charm of the car by hand. Body work. Engine and exhaust noise. Interior. Ride comfort. And now I'll share what was on my mind as I typed this: [A Review of the Alfa Romeo Disco Volante. Hand built by Touring in Milan.]( URL_0 ) **""I'm not gonna say it's the best car in the world. It certainly isn't the nicest to drive. The brakes are spongey, you can see *nothing* out of the back, but...as a tool for making you feel special, really nothing gets close. Nothing at all.""** Because we petrolheads ( car enthusiasts) like to think, that when a car is handmade it has been given a soul. Yes it while breakdown sometimes, and yes you can't really get spare parts. But it has this sort of flare. It is like driving a Ferrari instead of a GTR. It doesn't matter if the GTR is faster and better in every way. You driving the Ferrari because it is Ferrari. It is quiet hard to explain something like this to someone who is not interested in cars, so this is probably the best explanation that I can give to you. A different example where automation is less desirable: musical instruments. For the instruments that you buy in school, they were made primarily with machines (although a lot more human interaction than with cars). This makes the instrument affordable to amateurs. But for a professional, the instrument must be perfect and unique. The tone has to match their aesthetic, the instrument has to feel right to play, and it has to match with the people that the musician is playing with (like a Trumpet player in the opera would want a different horn than a jazz musician). Thus producing a series of identical instruments becomes undesirable simply because it's not fit for them. This is why a flute player will shell out $10k (sometimes) for a flute, or a violinist will pay $10k for their *bow*. Fun fact: the most expensive instrument ever sold was a Guarnieri violin for $3.9m Cars off the line aren't built with high grade materials and do not go through the quality control that say, a Rolls Royce does. They get the bare minimum necessary for comfort and control so they can be flung out of the dealerships at a high rate of sale. Once it's sold the bog-standard of-the-line vehicle is nothing more than a slowly decaying corpse, waiting for you to buy the new, better version so it can be recycled through second hand buyers and auctions. Eventually landing in the hands of a collector 30 years down the line or ending up in a scrap pile. It's actually worse for some of the high end cars where once it reaches an unknown expiry date, nobody want to touch it. Shit, that didn't really answer your question. [tl;dr]( URL_0 ) Because the robot built vehicles often use lower grade materials than hand-built or higher end vehicles so they can be sold quicker with a reasonable price tag. They are for the masses to use and abuse. It's not ""preferable"" thats just marketing working. It's a status symbol, it's not a better product just more expensive. You can compare it to the Iphone app that was only a sreen saver but it costs $999. Same with anything handmade rather than assembly line. If someone is going to spend time making something by hand that could be made cheaper on an assembly line, chances are they're using higher quality materials. Assembly lines are more precise, but they don't really know when something goes wrong. A robot knows to screw a nut onto a bolt, but can't really tell if that nut is broken or whatnot. As to the car specifically, it's a lot about name brand too.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 56.18, 'recall': 6.75, 'fmeasure': 12.06}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.65, 'recall': 1.04, 'fmeasure': 1.85}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 40.07, 'recall': 4.82, 'fmeasure': 8.6}}"

Why does using cruise control hurt your fuel economy?," In a car with a manual transmission, you're constantly shifting gears to keep the engine running at its most efficient point. When you use cruise control, you're not shifting, which means that the engine is running at a less efficient point for a longer time. In a car with an automatic transmission, the engine is always running at a less efficient point. The engine is running at its most efficient point when the transmission is in the highest gear, and when the engine is running at its most efficient point, it's making the most power. When you use cruise control, you're forcing the engine to run at a less efficient point, which means it's making less power. That means you're losing fuel economy. In addition to the gear changes, there are other factors that affect fuel economy. For example, the speed you're traveling affects the aerodynamics of the car, which affects fuel economy. When you use cruise control, you're not changing your speed, which means you're not changing the aerodynamics of the car. This means you're losing fuel economy.   is the temperature of the engine. When you use cruise control, you're not changing the temperature of the engine, which means it's running at a less efficient point. This means you're losing fuel economy.  ","On a modern car, cruise control should be more economical. One of the problems with cruise control is that it can't see the road ahead. So, the car will change gears on sudden inclines or declines too late and will, therefore, use more fuel - because of inefficient gearing. What saves fuel is not as much a matter if constant speed, but constant RPMs. Because it is rare to find a perfectly flat road, often the engine with have to change it's RPMs to maintain the constant speed. Higher RPMs will mean more fuel used. Overall I think cruise control improves fuel economy for most vehicles and driving conditions. Human drivers tend to change speed and drive inconsistently, thereby reducing fuel economy. On an incline and decline however, cruise control may cost you some gas.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 22.57, 'recall': 37.5, 'fmeasure': 28.18}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.89, 'recall': 8.15, 'fmeasure': 6.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 12.83, 'recall': 21.32, 'fmeasure': 16.02}}"
Why do tires have whiskers?,"The whiskers are to help the tire maintain traction. The tread is the bit that touches the road. The tread is made of rubber, which is very slippery. The whiskers are made of the same rubber, but they are thicker and more rigid. This means they are less slippery, but still flexible. They provide a bit of grip on the road, which is important when the tire is moving quickly.","Just looked it up. They're called 'vent spews.' When they fill the mold the tire is made in, they want to ensure there are no air bubbles or pockets in the tire, so they have small holes in the mold to allow the air to escape and some of the rubber gets spewed out of those holes, causing the little hairs/whiskers. Do you mean the little bits sticking out on new tires? They are called risers and help the rubber fill the mold fully in the manufacturing process.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 41.43, 'recall': 32.22, 'fmeasure': 36.25}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.14, 'recall': 7.87, 'fmeasure': 8.86}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.29, 'recall': 18.89, 'fmeasure': 21.25}}"
Why do. American cities lack the tram and subway systems that are prevalent in Europe?,"A lot of cities in Europe have been around for a lot longer than American cities. Most of the cities in Europe were built by the Romans, who were very advanced in engineering. They had a lot of experience with building cities and roads. They knew how to build roads that could support heavy loads and they knew how to build roads that could last for a long time. They also had a lot of experience building cities that could support a lot of people.   of houses, a lot of shops, and a lot of industry. They knew how to build cities that could feed a lot of people. They also knew how to build cities that could support a lot of people who didn't work.   of parks, a lot of gardens, and a lot of green space. They also knew how to build cities that had a lot of art, a lot of music, and a lot of culture.   of entertainment.   of recreation.   of sports.   of entertainment.   of recreation.   of sports.  ","**lots** of reasons The American rail system is focused on shipping freight which it does very well. Westward expansion took over a century which meant it was difficult to plan where new population centers would be cropping up in relation to the older cities. Lobbying and scheming by motor companies to make America based around the car, the documentary *Taken for a Ride* does a good job covering this. Many states are mostly rural areas which negates the usefulness of light rail somewhat. And finally I think that many people just prefer the freedom and independence afforded by using automobiles. A very large number of American cities were built (or expanded into cities from being towns) after the invention of the Car. As such they were designed for people to use cars to navigate them, not for them to be walked on foot. When most people have and use cars there is very little that you can do to justify spending tax money on a public transit system, and very little motivation for a private company to provide it. People use cars for pretty much any journey in the US. When I went there on business, I was asked by a colleague what I was doing for lunch and I said I'd probably pick up a sandwich from the supermarket which was less than 200 yards away across the office car park. He asked me how I was getting there and I said walking and he was having none of that insisted on driving me there, all 20 seconds of the journey. He seemed oblivious to the fact that it might be nice to get some fresh air. Another day I thought about visiting a store which was about three miles away. I do a lot of walking/hiking so it's a distance I walk regularly and I figured there'd be a route I could take to it and it would make a nice walk after being sat in an office all day. Not a chance in hell. I'd have to take a car to get there because of the road systems. Mainly because those systems are only profitable in very densely populated areas, particularly when several very dense cities are located very close to each other. Most of the cities in the US just aren't as dense as European cities, and they tend to spread out more. Of course, the really dense American cities -- New York, Chicago, etc. -- do have subway systems. There are a lot of factors listed here. One in cities like Houston, Texas is that it is massive and spread out. Houston is the 4th most populated city in the US and is a little larger than London at 1630 sq km, but has 25% of the population. People work far from where they live and have to commute all over the city. Light rail trains, buses, and high occupancy vehicle lanes cut down on the amount of vehicles on the road, but some drive distances/locations are not practical without allowing 2+ hours commute each way daily. Downtown Houston is only about 50 feet above sea level, so underground subway systems are not practical. Here is a quick guide to why the US sucks at public Transportation. Largest cities in the world ranked by land area in sqKm 1. NY metro 8683 2. Tokyo 6993 3. Chicago 5,498 4. Atlanta 5,083 5. Philadelphia 4,661 6. Boston 4,497 7. Los Angeles 4,320 8. Dallas/Fort Worth 3,644 9. Houston 3,355 10. Detroit 3,267 11. Washington DC 2,996 12. Miami 2,891 You have to get to 13th to find the 2nd city not in the US. We are the 3rd most populated country in the world but the 179th in population density. TLDR. We are really freaking big and spread out. A lot of it really has to do when cities were developed. Major cities like SF, NY, Chicago have solid public transit. But once you get outside of the centers its a lot of open space. A good example would be San Jose California. 3rd largest city in California. More people than San Francisco. Public transit in San Jose isn't that great and the reality is you need a car. The reason why is it was mostly orchids and stuff like that 50 years ago. Then the tech boom hit and it grew rapidly. Well most people really weren't trying to move into cities so suburbs happened. Having a home with a yard was all part of that American dream. The main plot of Who Framed Rodger Rabbit happened for real. URL_0 Although, my hometown city, San Diego, still had a really good public transit system (trolleys and buses) when I lived there, and I have been to and used public transit in Boston, New York, Chicago and Washington D.C., with little to no complaints, except for the smell, and sometimes the heat. US was built in the car era. The government provided big subsidies for motorway systems, and happily drove them through downtown (European cities tend to have a ring road out beyond the suburbs). At the same time new zoning laws required plenty of parking for all those cars, prevented densification of existing suburbs (driving growth out with new suburbs) and city councils encouraged things like very wide roads (which are both convenient for drivers and difficult to cross for pedestrians). Houston is a good example of this. Built on a massive motorway network, development laws requiring huge plots even for single homes, minimum parking requirements​, etc. The result of all this is US cities are overwhelming car centric. They can't support transit ridership the way European and Asian cities can without completely changing their geography. Many cities did. It was systematically killed off and purchased by companies like General Motors to sell cars. There's a good documentary on it on YouTube. URL_0 Major cities have subway, bus, rail, and ferry systems where applicable - e.g., Boston, NYC, Chicago, LA, DC, etc. However there are *so many cities* in the US, and the US is massive. It does not make logistical sense to have subway systems in a city that does not have the same level of population as some of those cities. The cost of running the system has to be offset by the rider usage. If there aren't enough riders - like in many rural area cities, where most everyone has a car - it would not be cost effective. How do American (from southern US) deal with the lack of consistency of their ""transport"" policies ? One one hand it seems they do everything to prevent you to take the car (toll road, expensive parking like $20 a day) but on the other hand there is no/few public transportation (I think I saw one Tram line in Dallas downtown, and one ""monorail"" in Jacksonville Downtown to name some place) and I don't talk about the lack of pedestrian sidewalks... I understand that most of the US cities are extended and have low density area which make hard to build efficient public transportation network. But If I compare (for example) to Paris suburb, in low density place you have a big parking near the urban train station which allow people to drive only the 2-5 km from their house to the station and avoid the traffic by taking the train. Hey, do you know how European cities have these amazing, elaborate tram and subway systems in the first place? We had the ""opportunity"" to completely restructre our cities, oh, about 70 odd years ago. Turns out, when pretty much all your city is obliterated after WW2, and you have to rebuild anyways, there is a lot of free space where you can stick those transportation systems. Basically, you did the demolition for us. All the building and zoneing people had to do was clear the rubble and now we have parks in inner cities, zoos near the city centres, and relatively broad roadways. Plus, the space-consumeing railways. American cities were, for the most part, never destroyed that completely. You had to integrate public transport into living cities, which is almost impossible to do. Construction takes that much longer and is therefore that much more expensive because you can only do it in increments. Plus, shutting down certain parts of the city can become nigh-impossible because they are major traffic arteries. And there is the matter of aquiring the property you need to do construction on or underneath. If anyone gets wind of the project the prices are going to rocket sky high. Plus, what good is it to maintain old tram systems, even when they are profitable, when they're just going to be stuck in the traffic created by the cars? The more cars became prelevant, the less useful the tram becomes. Therefore, you need either subway systems (tunneling) or some sort of monorail / a bridge system to get your tram around. And those are way more expensive to build than tram systems on the ground. See also: The problem of aquiring the land in a city that is already completely owned by a hundred thousand different people. Even those support beams have to stand on somebody's land. And every time you attempt to do these project, the prices are going to go up. Plus, no-one is happy to live next to the subway, right? Those property prices are going to plummet because of noise polution. So you always have the big-construction-problem of groups forming to protest your new railway plans. Possibly to the point of stonewaling you and voting you out of office before you can make significant progress. A related question for Americans: How do you do when you go out and grab a beer or ten? That is the #1 reason I'm so happy to have a good underground train system. After reading many of these comments I am surprised no one mentioned oil industry lobbyists. In addition to the other things mentioned here there's a general stigma surrounding public transport which causes a lack of support for creating public transport that would remove said stigma. Trains are too expensive for what you get. (Both long distance and local). Trains in the city, your with a crowd of people in an enclose area and it cost around the same for a ride share app that is more convenient by dropping you off at a specific location. Long distance train fares are outrageous you might as well get an airline ticket. Well our highway, interstates, and roads are basically everywhere and its easy to go with about 10 different ways to get there. Also big oil had a lot to do with it. Thats why trains are used a lot on the east coast and basically used purely for frieght out west despite the size of California and the benefits it would gain from a subway. Wealth in European cities is concentrated in the city center, but wealth in American cities is concentrated in the suburbs. City metros & subways in Europe are much more profitable compared to America due to the higher traffic","{'rouge1': {'precision': 72.25, 'recall': 6.63, 'fmeasure': 12.15}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.6, 'recall': 1.7, 'fmeasure': 3.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 42.77, 'recall': 3.93, 'fmeasure': 7.19}}"
what is the purpose of the grooves in gravel roads?,It's called a rut. It helps water flow through the road. The water flows into the grooves and then out to the sides. It helps prevent the road from washing away. The water flow helps keep the road in place. It also helps to keep the road from getting too slippery. The water helps to lubricate the road. The water flowing through the grooves helps to prevent the road from getting too slippery. It also helps to prevent the road from getting too dusty. The water helps to keep the road in good condition.,"The phenomenon is called ""[Washboarding]( URL_0 )"". It's caused by the wheels of cars bouncing on the road gradually moving the gravel, sand, or even clay around. They don't have a ""purpose"". It's how the road wears. When the gravel road is first laid down (or regraveled), the grooves aren't there. They form over time as the road wears. Why the road wears in that pattern I cannot tell you for certain. I suspect that it is due to the grader blade catching and jumping a bit as the road was first made. But I don't really know. Its washboarding, like tsuuga said. Its caused by vehicles either bouncing on uneven rock or spinning their tires on loose gravel. Water accumulation from rain on a gravel road that isn't properly crowned can lead to improper drainage and water sitting on the surface and washing out the fines (very small rock/sand) that helps to bind the bigger rocks together, which can also lead to more bumps or potholes. Then it just compounds on itself, as more vehicles travel over one of these bad spots, it will lead to vehicles bouncing or spinning tires more and more and more loose rock and bigger holes and it will just keep increasing the problem exponentially (not really that fast, but almost). Gravel roads will never stay perfect, no matter how well they are designed and compacted, eventually someone will spin a tire and everything will just go downhill from there. They require regular maintenance (grading and sometimes compacting), depending on how much use the road sees, and if its regular cars, or loaded log trucks. Its cheaper to build a gravel road and maintain it for low volume travel than it is to build a paved road. Forest engineer here, I design and layout logging roads (gravel roads) for a living. I also used to maintain these roads with heavy equipment (grader operator).

What causes some images to be wavy for a moment but then render correctly?," Saw this question on Quora and decided to answer it. I am an artist and an animator. I have a degree in computer science.

","There are two things going on here. The first is that this is a photograph of a TV screen. The TV screen has pixels, and so does the camera that took that photo, and so also does the device you're viewing the image on. The different sets of pixels don't necessarily line up perfectly, and under certain circumstances when this happens, the result is regular or semi-regular patterns, which can often look like wavy lines. This effect is called ""moiré"". The second is that the image is most likely saved in a ""progressive"" format. The image downloads in stages, first with really big pixels which gives you a blurry version of the image that displays fairly quickly, and then more detail is added, making the pixels smaller to give you a much sharper image. So on the left, you have the partially-downloaded image with the big pixels, and due to the respective resolutions of the TV screen, the camera and your device, that just happens to give you that moiré pattern.

What's the difference between a powerful (semi truck) and fast (racecar) engine?," Lots of power, lots of speed. Power is torque multiplied by speed, so if the engine is putting out 1000 lb-ft of torque at 6000 rpm, it's putting out 6000000 lb-ft of torque. The power of a car engine is measured in horsepower, and the power of a truck engine is measured in horsepower per ton of weight. A truck engine is designed to have a lot of torque, which is the rotational force of the engine. A car engine is designed to have a lot of horsepower, which is the rate of acceleration of the engine. A car engine is designed to accelerate a lighter vehicle, and is designed to go fast for a short time. A truck engine is designed to haul a heavy load over a long distance. The truck engine is designed to accelerate the truck over a long distance, and is designed to have a lot of torque, which is the rotational force of the engine. The engine in a race car is designed to accelerate the race car over a short distance, and is designed to have a lot of horsepower, which is the rate of acceleration of the engine.","The difference all boils down to torque. That is how much turning force an engine can put out. Torque is arguably a more important number in determining engine performance than horsepower. Now there's two ways to increase torque: raise the pressure inside the engine, or increase the number of cylinders. In the case of a truck, you're dealing with a heavy object that needs a lot of torque to get moving. So you want your peak torque to all be at the low end of your RPM band. To do this, we turn up the pressure, aka the compression ratio. The piston will squeeze the air/fuel mixture more before it ignites. When you compress the mixture, it generates heat. If you compress it enough, that heat will cause the fuel to spontaneously ignite, slamming the piston back down with a lot of force. That force is transferred to the wheels, which helps get that heavy load moving. This is why trucks use diesel engines. Diesel fuel stands up to high pressures without igniting too quickly. So you can get pressures in the cylinders really high, meaning lots of low end torque. The downside is that due to the high pressures, diesel engines have to be built strong. That makes them heavy. A heavier engine can't spin around as fast. Nor does it like to change its rotational speed very quickly. Gearing can help, but you're ultimately limited how fast you can go, and how quickly you can accelerate. Now gasoline/top fuel engines use lower compression. They can be built much lighter since they don't have to hold up to very high pressures. So the engine can run faster. If you want more power, you just dump more air/fuel into the system. So they produce more torque the faster you rev them. Great for racing, because you're going to be running high RPM at full throttle. But even if you dump more fuel in, you're ultimately limited to how big the engine's volume is. So we need to go bigger. Now you could make one big cylinder, but that's going to require more momentum to get it moving. It's also less compact. So instead you work with several smaller cylinders. To increase torque, just increase the number of cylinders. You can increase power without having to increase the mass or work done by one piston. And you can just keep adding pistons. Petrol aviation engines will have 12, 24, even 36 cylinders and run at thousands or horsepower. A diesel can do the same with far fewer cylinders, but it'll run slower. Think of it like dragging a cart with a rope. You could get one big dude (think The Mountain) and he'll be able to efficiently pull it by himself without getting too tired, all be it slowly. But if you have four skinny guys, they can each share the work and move it faster, but they're going to tire out faster because they have less endurance. Of course there are gasoline engines that can run at higher pressures to increase torque. But these are more complex than a diesel, and also require specially formulated fuel. That is because gasoline self ignites more readily at lower temperatures. If it ignites prematurely, it can severely damage the engine in a phenomenon known as ""detonation"" or ""knocking"". They will use these more complex engines in race cars to help improve low end acceleration while keeping high end torque. However, it's not that common in road cars except high end ones. So what if you need the best of both worlds without increasing complexity, or making the vehicle prohibitively expensive? That's where electric come in. An electric motor produces consistently strong torque at all RPM bands, in a lightweight package. You'll see them used in vehicles like trains, which need to pull very heavy loads, but also need to go fast. Or Formula E race cars, which can accelerate very quickly. Horsepower is how fast you hit the wall, torque is how far you move that wall. Semi's have to move a lot of load, so they're built to supply torque. Race cars just have to go fast, so they're built for more horsepower. Most of the answers so far have mentioned only torque vs horsepower. Just to be complete, HP is calculated from torque...so it is a derived unit based on RPM. There are a lot of other differences that you might be interested in. A racecar engine is designed to have the highest possible power-to-weight ratio... it needs to be as light as possible to keep the weight of the car down. It's also important to keep the moving parts very light, as heavy parts have more *momentum* once they are moving, and more *inertia* if they are stopped. This is important in race engines (especially F1) because the engines are required to run very fast, then slow down quickly, then speed up again... thousands of times in a race. Because these moving parts are so light, they need to spin *very* fast to have as much power as a heavier motor spinning slowly. This is the main reason race engines need to spin at very high RPM to generate a lot of power. All the parts are optimized to be light, and very well balanced. Only the very finest materials are used. The *tolerances* (spaces between moving parts) are extremely small. An F1 engine can cost between 8 - 10 million dollars. Each. That semi-truck engine? Lots of torque...but it does not spin very fast. Compared to a race engine, they are quite crudely made. Many thousands are built...and they are designed to be easy to assemble, and last a reasonable time, with minimum maintenance.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 74.87, 'recall': 15.16, 'fmeasure': 25.21}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.7, 'recall': 3.97, 'fmeasure': 6.61}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 36.68, 'recall': 7.43, 'fmeasure': 12.35}}"
My nearest major city has a road grid that is *slightly* angled off East West. Is there a practical reason for this?,"Yes, and it is due to the fact that the city was founded in the early 19th century when the railroad was built. The railroad was built with the tracks running East West, so the city was laid out to follow the tracks.

why space rockets do not tip over at T plus one second? What keeps them in vertical position?,"> Why don't they tip over? The rocket is still in the process of taking off. It's not yet in the air. > What keeps them in vertical position? The rocket is still on the launch pad, and the rocket is still being held down by the launch pad. The rocket is not yet in the air. The rocket is not yet in motion.","The engines at the bottom of the rocket are mounted on gimbals that can adjust their direction. The rocket has very precise sensors that can detect if it's starting to tip over, and its computer will react by angling one of the engines to push back the other direction. It took a lot of engineering and fine-tuning before we got the sensors and the engine adjustments right. Back in the '50s, a *lot* of rockets blew up on the pad or shortly after launch. [Here's one compilation]( URL_0 ) of some early rocket failures. Gravity affects the entire rocket more or less equally (the distance between the furthest and closest point to said gravity on the rocket is too small to really affect anything), so being properly upright to begin with is a major help. With a perfectly aligned axis of thrust, there's nothing to torque the rocket off either. Of course, to help make sure everything does operate properly, as nothing's truly perfect and there's also air currents to worry about, the rocket itself has some active stabilizers. Used to be tiny jets of air or other materials to help provide thrust counter to whatever direction it might start tipping towards, but nowadays all of the engines are gimbaled: Effectively the rocket uses limited thrust vectoring to make tiny adjustments and keep itself perfectly on course. Once it's actually picked up some speed, rotational inertia will also add in to the list of things keeping it going nice and up.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 51.56, 'recall': 12.79, 'fmeasure': 20.5}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.46, 'recall': 4.28, 'fmeasure': 6.87}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 35.94, 'recall': 8.91, 'fmeasure': 14.29}}"
Why are radio waves preferred for long distance communication?,"Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, similar to visible light. They are used for long distance communication because they are able to travel over great distances without being absorbed or scattered by air or other materials. They are also used for long distance communication because they are relatively cheap to produce and use. It's a lot easier to make a radio transmitter and receiver than a microwave oven. Radio waves are very useful for long distance communication because they are able to travel long distances without being absorbed or scattered by air or other materials. Radio waves are able to travel long distances because they are able to pass through the air without being absorbed or scattered by the air molecules. This is because radio waves are much longer than the wavelength of visible light, so they are able to pass through the air without being absorbed or scattered. Visible light has a wavelength of around 400 to 700 nanometers, so it is able to be absorbed or scattered by the air molecules. This is why light is only able to travel a short distance through the air. Radio waves have a wavelength of around 1 to 10 meters, so they are able to pass through the air without being absorbed or scattered. This is why radio waves are able to travel long distances without being absorbed or scattered.  ","Nice properties of radio waves: 1) The go through walls, unless they are made of metal. 2) They are bent by the upper layers of the atmosphere, so a radio message can go from the US to Europe. 3) Very sensitive receivers are mass produced at very low cost, so that only a very small part of the signal is needed to produce long distance communications. Cable is preferred for long distance communication if you don't have to move around. Are you asking why radio instead of x-rays or infrared? > Why are radio waves preferred for long distance communication? They aren't. The preferred method is trans-continental fiber-optic cable. At $50-400m (not including launch insurance or the cost of the launch itself), 288 strand fiber is cheaper per mile at ~$6/ft than a satellite, it doesn't suffer from interference, the signals are extremely difficult to intercept, since it's terrestrial it's relatively easily maintained, and latency is much shorter. Satellites have a typical theoretical maximum bandwidth of 155 Mbps, but in practice they get much less than that, whereas single mode fiber can achieve 10 Gbps per strand, and multi-mode is regarded as effectively near limitless at distances less than 100m. DWDM can achieve up to 16 Tbps, or more bandwidth on a single fiber than all operational communications satellites. Microwaves are used for point to point communication between two towers, using directional horns or parabolas, and have some specific application, enough that you still see them in use often enough, I suppose. From personal experience, I can tell you you're not supposed to stand in front of a horn because you can get yourself cooked from the inside out at those radio frequencies and amplitudes. For broadcast public radio, certain frequency bands have desirable propagation properties that make them cheap to operate and achieve wide coverage. Radio is typically the preferred method of communication when you don't have access to a physical line. A single satellite can provide line of sight coverage as far as to the horizon of it's purview from it's orbit. Antenna towers are preferred to be as high as possible for a similar reason, line of sight coverage. Different frequencies have different propagation characteristics. It's not an arbitrary decision that WiFi is in the 2.4 GHz band, those frequencies at typically 100 mW will scatter and be absorbed within a few hundred feet, perfect for local area coverage. These properties have helped dictate aspects of FCC regulation regarding things like tower height, maximum output, and frequency allocations.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.97, 'recall': 23.34, 'fmeasure': 30.49}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.96, 'recall': 5.28, 'fmeasure': 6.9}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.26, 'recall': 10.76, 'fmeasure': 14.05}}"
"Why does the typical wooden house built today (or buildings I've seen built as new developments) look like there isn't enough there to hold it up, yet stand to hold a fair amount of weight?","It's not uncommon for houses to look like they're going to fall down, but they're actually very sturdy. There are a couple reasons for this. First, the way the wood is cut and arranged in the house is actually a very strong structure. The cuts are made so that the wood is very strong in the direction that the house needs to be strongest. For example, the strongest part of a house is the load-bearing walls, which are the walls that hold the house up. These walls are made with cuts that make them very strong in the direction they need to be strongest. The walls are also made very wide, which helps to distribute the weight of the house evenly. Second, the houses are built with a lot of insulation, which helps to keep the house from collapsing. Insulation helps to distribute the weight of the house evenly, and it also helps to keep the house warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Finally, the houses are built with a lot of reinforcement. This is often in the form of steel, which is a very strong material that is used to reinforce the house. This helps to make the house even stronger than it would be otherwise. It's not uncommon for houses to look like they're going to fall down, but they're actually very sturdy.","Civil engineer here. There are two parts to this: 1. There has been a shift in the way things are designed over time. When we started building things centuries ago, we didn't quite understand material properties, so we over designed our structures i.e. we put in extra to make sure it would stand up. That's part of the reason many ancient structures are still standing, they are far stronger than they need to be. As we have tested and learnt more about materials, we are able to design structures closer to what they need for their purpose. This was mostly driven by cost during recession periods, where work was more competitive, so being able to build the same structure with less material meant you could bid a lower price on the job, so you were more likely to get selected. 2. For wood in particular, we have always known it is strong (100ft redwoods for example), but the problem has been knowing how strong a particular piece of wood is. For concrete or steel, you can try a particular method of manufacture, test the product to destruction, and know with reasonable certainty that if you use the same method again you will get a product of a certain strength. Wood is grown, so every tree will be slightly different, so when we used wood before, we over designed to make sure it was strong enough. Then we developed glulam, or laminated sheets of wood that were glued together to form​ structural members. This allowed for more certainty in the strength, therefore we can design wooden structures more efficiently. TL;DR - cost pushed us to design more efficient buildings, and wood was made more reliable by gluing sheets of it together instead of just cutting trees to the required shape.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 40.0, 'recall': 31.13, 'fmeasure': 35.01}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.84, 'recall': 5.32, 'fmeasure': 5.98}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.87, 'recall': 13.91, 'fmeasure': 15.64}}"
Is it better to leave a car running while idling or to turn it off and on when you need to move?,"This is a question that has been debated for a long time. There are two sides to this argument, and they both have valid points. The first side says that leaving the car running is better because it uses less fuel to start the engine again. The second side says that it is better to turn it off because it is better for the environment and it is better for the car. The truth is that it depends on the situation. If you are just sitting there for a minute or two, it is better to turn off the engine. If you are going to be sitting there for a long time, it is better to leave it running. This is because the car will use less fuel to start the engine again. The other thing is that idling is not good for your car. It is bad for the engine, and it is bad for the fuel system. It can also be bad for the environment. This is because idling produces pollutants. These pollutants are bad for the environment, and they can also be bad for your health. So if you are going to be sitting there for a long time, it is better to turn off the engine. If you are just going to be sitting there for a minute or two, it is better to leave it running.","It depends. Each time you start a vehicle you increase wear on the starter motor, which is a heavy-duty motor near the back of the engine that is powerful enough to spin the engine without using any petrol. This wear and tear isn't all that important, but the starter motor uses a lot of electricity to work and will therefore drain the car's battery very quickly. The battery gets charged when you drive around, but this takes quite a long time, so if you keep turning the engine off and on, eventually it'll go flat and won't be strong enough to start the car. To reduce pollution and save fuel, lots of modern cars have something called stop-start technology. This means that the engine will stop in the best position to restart, using the least amount of fuel and electricity in the battery. And the car is clever, so it knows if the battery is almost flat and will keep the engine running to charge it back up. The short answer is, if you don't need any heat or aircon and you know you're going to be idling for more than a few minutes, turn the engine off. If you're waiting at traffic lights, or in light congestion, keep the engine on. It depends on the engine and the time. Starting the engine uses more fuel for a short time than to keep it running for the same time, especially with older engines. But this is for something like 5 to 10 seconds. If you know you'll be waiting longer, turn it off. There are now quite a few cars that turn off your engine while stopped and then restart it when you press on the pedal. This can increase fuel economy in the city by about 1-2 mpg. Of course those cars are designed to do that so I would not recommend doing it with a car not designed for it. Overall idling is better for the engine but you do waste fuel, and only turning it off for a little bit and then starting back up while everything is still warm and lubricated won't hurt the engine much if at all. Yet it is not something you should continually do since your car is not designed for that kind of use (specifically your starter motor and possibly battery usage).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.58, 'recall': 33.0, 'fmeasure': 41.96}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.39, 'recall': 9.95, 'fmeasure': 12.66}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.71, 'recall': 15.88, 'fmeasure': 20.19}}"
Why did cellphones only become popular recently in the last decade when walkie talkies and transistor radios were available long before?,"Cell phones were not really practical for a long time. They were bulky and expensive, and you needed to have a phone booth to charge them. They also didn't have the capabilities of a modern cell phone. They didn't have internet access, or the ability to make voice calls over the internet. They were just a radio, so you could make voice calls, but only over the phone network. They were not really useful for a long time. They were also not very portable. They were bulky, and you needed a separate battery to use them. They were also expensive, and not very practical for most people. Transistor radios were also bulky and expensive, and not very practical for most people.  , and they didn't have the same capabilities as a modern cell phone. They were also not very practical for most people, and they didn't really have much use for most people. Walkie talkies were not very practical for most people either. They were bulky and expensive, and not very portable. They were also not very useful, because they were not really good for talking over long distances. They were just good for talking to people in the same room. They were not very practical for most people, and they didn't really have much use for most people. They also didn't really have much use for most people.  ","The main problem with walkie talkies is range. Walkie talkies are only limited to a few kilometers, and they need to broadcast a very powerful signal. The farther you are, the more powerful the signal needs to be. The main innovation of cellular phones is the cellular part. When you call someone, your phone doesn't directly connect with their phone. Instead, your phone connects to a cellphone tower in its vicinity, while the recipient is also connected to a cellphone tower in their vicinity. The two cellphone towers are physically connected through a series of wires (well, not directly, they pass through a switching center). This way each phone only has to have a signal powerful enough to reach the closest cellphone tower. > Did it take a long time for the technology of radios used by the army to become available for home use? No, but it took a long time for the price of cell phones to drop and it also took a while for cell carriers to have coverage in enough places to justify the cost of the device and the calling plan that came with it. Up until 80s when the first cell phones became available, radios and walkie-talkies weren't common. Police cruisers would have a radio, but individual police would not. This is because they were so large and required such large batteries that they would prohibit certain movements. Hence why early cellphones were car phojes and bag phones, never meant to be truly mobile but keant to be transferred from home to car with a few minutes of life away from a power source. It wasn't until the late 80s and into the 90s that they became smaller and powrr sources became more efficient that you could have them on your person and not be prohibited by the size and weight.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 34.19, 'recall': 25.81, 'fmeasure': 29.41}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.01, 'recall': 4.53, 'fmeasure': 5.17}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.52, 'recall': 13.23, 'fmeasure': 15.07}}"
Why do some establishments and government departments not upgrade their computer's OS?,"It's not just a matter of ""not wanting to pay"". It's a matter of ""not wanting to pay for something that doesn't do anything"". The OS is the software that runs the computer, and it's the part of the computer that you interact with most. But the OS is also the part of the computer that's most vulnerable to hacking. If you're a business, you don't want to be hacked. You don't want your employees' passwords to be stolen. You don't want your customers' credit card numbers to be stolen. And you don't want your business's reputation to be stolen. So you do everything you can to prevent that from happening. One way to prevent hacking is to not run the latest version of the OS. That's because hackers tend to target the latest version of the OS. They know that if they can get into the latest version of the OS, they can get into all of the computers that run that version. So if you don't run the latest version of the OS, you're less likely to get hacked. But that's not the only reason. The other reason is that the latest version of the OS might not do anything that's worth paying for.  ","Usually it's because they have some old app that, due to a design problem, does not work right on the modern version of the OS. Sometimes it's because their IT department does not have enough staff to upgrade their numerous computers; everyone is busy. Sometimes it's because the bosses would not allocate the budget for needed upgrades, if they were not free of charge. Resources mainly time and money. The training for the new interface. Different programs that they use do not have compatibility with the OS. Most companies or groups do not delay advancement out of choice, but rather that they are waiting to confirm that advancing will not hurt their production activities. In addition to the great answers here about cost and support of old hardware/software, there's also the question of security. The Army, for example, spends a great deal of time and money doing everything they can to lock down workstations and keep them free of viruses, and to limit access by people who shouldn't have access. If they spend five years patching security flaws in, say, Windows 7, and then finally manage to get everything just the way they want it, why would they then switch to Windows 10 and risk re-opening all those security fixes, or opening entirely new ones? Does Windows 10 offer them some inherent advantage that makes it worth the trouble, or is upgrading something they'd just be doing to keep current, because reasons? If there's no clear advantage to spending the money, time, and resources to upgrade and then fix all the things that are going to go wrong, there's no good reason to bother. If everything is working perfectly on Windows 7, why should they upgrade to Windows 10?","{'rouge1': {'precision': 42.34, 'recall': 31.44, 'fmeasure': 36.08}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.88, 'recall': 4.36, 'fmeasure': 5.01}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.82, 'recall': 14.72, 'fmeasure': 16.89}}"
"why could old mopeds (before many antipollution laws) get insane mileage while new ""ecofriendly"" ones can't?","The older mopeds were smaller and lighter, and their engines were less efficient, which meant they could get more mileage per unit of fuel. The newer mopeds are larger and heavier, and their engines are more efficient, which means they get less mileage per unit of fuel.","The very short answer is that they were tuned differently. By increasing the amount of oxygen present during the combustion cycle, you can extract more power from the same amount of gas (or the same power from less gas), which increases fuel economy. However, oxygen-rich combustion (or *lean* combustion) is extremely hot, which produces more pollutants (specifically ~~hydrocarbons~~ oxides of nitrogen, as /u/tminus7700 corrected me below). In order to be ""ecofriendly"", new mopeds (or any Carnot cycle gas engine) has to meet a certain emissions threshold. To reduce the number of pollutants, they have to cool down the combustion.

How does forcing laptops to be in checked luggage prevent bombs hidden in laptops?,Your body knows when you're getting a cold and it tries to fight it. Your body also knows that you need to rest and so it makes you feel tired so you can rest and fight off the cold.,"The idea is that a laptop bomb is usually going to be used in an attempt to depressurize the plane by detonating it next to a window. If the laptop is stored with cargo, it will be dampened by all the other stored cargo and probably won't have any devastating effect except to the luggage of the unlucky people who got the storage space next to the bomb. You are looking for sense where there is none. The entire set of security rules is just a random patchwork of unsubstantiated fears. Many things about Airplane/Airport security don't really make much sense - a couple likely reasons are that a Laptop's removable Lithium Ion Battery, if handled the wrong way can explode, and as a result makes a good improvised bomb, placing it in checked luggage makes it easier to detect and prevent from being loaded onto the plane a battery or laptop which has been tampered with, as the owner won't have access to it in order to take a normal battery and convert it to an IED on the plane. You mention C-4 and RDX in a second level comment, it is possible that the intent is to give airport security a chance to run a bomb dog over the luggage, but I doubt this has anything to do with reducing the amount of damage a plane takes if a bomb goes off, and more to do with preventing bombs from getting on in the first place.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 42.5, 'recall': 6.72, 'fmeasure': 11.6}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.0, 'recall': 0.0, 'fmeasure': 0.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.5, 'recall': 5.14, 'fmeasure': 8.87}}"
What does it mean when software is open source? How come others can't just look at the coding of closed source software?,"Open source means that anyone can look at the code and modify it. Closed source means that only the company that owns the software can look at the code and modify it. It's like if you were building a house. Open source means that anyone can look at the plans, and anyone can make changes to the plans. Closed source means that only you can look at the plans, and only you can make changes to the plans.","Think of software as a delicious cake. Think of source code as the recipe for the cake. For both open source and closed source software, you get to eat the cake. For open source, the recipe is available to you. For closed source, the recipe is a secret kept by the people who sold the cake. You can take a closed source cake and attempt to figure out a recipe from it, but you don't really get the recipe. Source code is what software is initially written in by a human programmer. The programmer selects a language (or, in some cases, multiple languages) and uses it to create the source code of the program. Depending on the language used and the skill of the programmer, the source code could be very easily readable by a programmer, or it could be nearly impossible. Most software source code lies somewhere in between. This source code represents the logic of the program, but it can't be ""run"" directly. Another program needs to either compile or interpret it. Compilation is the process of turning source code into byte/machine code, which the hardware knows how to run. Interpretation is the process of reading through source code and converting the source code instructions into into a running program ""on the fly"". Programming languages are often, at a high level, divided into ""compiled languages"" (like C, C++, or Java) and ""interpreted (or scripting) languages"" (like JavaScript, python, ruby, perl) depending on which route is used. For (closed-source) compiled apps, only the byte/machine code is distributed. There is no deterministic method of reversing the compilation process back to get the original source code. There are many reasons for this but two stand out: 1. Optimization. The compiler is much smarter than human programmers so when it compiles the code, it makes changes to the actual logic. This produces the same result that the programmer intended, but performs the task much more efficiently so that the code runs faster, uses less memory, or both, compared to what the programmer actually wrote 2. There's More Than One Way To Do It. Programming languages are much more verbose than machine code. There could be thousands (or even infinite) ways to write the same program in a given high level language, that all compile to the same machine code. There would be no way to know which one of those alternatives was intended, given the machine code, so reversal is impossible. On the other hand, for interpreted code, the source code is generally what's distributed, because there is no intermediary phase of compiling to machine code. Most developers of such software stick to an open source model for this reason, but for others, there are alternatives, such as obfuscation (turning source code into intentionally less-readable source code prior to distribution). Editing to add: one of the big reasons why source code is verbose and machine code is not is that in source code (for most useful real-world languages, anyway), things have names: variables, constants, functions, classes... all of these things are named (hopefully) to indicate what they're for, what they do, what they mean. When the source is converted to machine code, all of this naming is automatically lost. In the machine code, all those things only have numeric addresses -- there's no context of what things mean. The same thing can be accomplished through obfuscation: change every variable name to vNNNNN and every function to fNNNNN and your code will be nearly uninterpretable (to humans) without any change to its meaning to the computer. The key word here isn't ""open"" or ""closed,"" it's ""source."" Source code is readable, logical, full of structure and flow. But the computer doesn't run that (well, it does if the language is *scripted* or *interpreted*, but those have huge tradeoffs). The source code is *compiled* into a program that your computer can run directly. **Almost all of the content of the source code is thrown out, when compiling. It's there to direct the compiler in making a finished product, not to be *part* of the finished product**. So you can take the finished product and try to reverse it back into source code, but there's not much left to work with. In Open Source software, you can see that original source code, and work with it. In Closed Source software, you only get the compiled bit. They keep the code private.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 64.56, 'recall': 6.8, 'fmeasure': 12.3}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.23, 'recall': 2.0, 'fmeasure': 3.63}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 45.57, 'recall': 4.8, 'fmeasure': 8.69}}"
"Why are houses in the United States built out of wood instead of stronger materials, specially in the middle of hurricane and tornado country?","The houses are built out of wood because it's cheaper than other materials and it's a lot easier to use. It's also a lot easier to rebuild a house that's been damaged by a hurricane or tornado than a house made of concrete or steel. If you're a homeowner and you've been hit by a hurricane or tornado, it's a lot easier to tear down the damaged house and rebuild a new one out of wood. If you're a homeowner and you've been hit by a hurricane or tornado, it's a lot easier to tear down the damaged house and rebuild a new one out of wood. The materials used in building a house are not the only thing that determines how strong it is. The design of the house is also important. The design of a house is determined by the local building codes, which vary from place to place. The building codes are intended to ensure that houses are built in a way that will protect the occupants and the surrounding area.  ","Wood is plenty strong against most problems, and where it fails (like in tornadoes) so do ""stronger"" materials. The biggest danger in hurricanes is flooding, where concrete blocks or bricks are just as bad. Block construction, while stronger in compression, is weaker than almost anything in tension and shear, like you get with strong winds or earthquakes. Block buildings are some of the *worst* construction in earthquake-prone areas. This has been a serious problem in several disasters in third world areas. They can be reinforced well enough to be acceptable, but in many cases that means building a double-wall with framing as a separate reinforcing layer, making it not really a pure block construction at all. Lastly, block walls are harder to insulate against serious cold. Altogether, framed walls (wood or steel) are a *good* design choice for a lot of the conditions around North America. Sorry, Cost is the answer. It's a tradeoff between the cost of materials and the cost of workers. Houses in hurricane districts in Florida are made of concrete blocks or poured concrete. It's 50% more expensive that wood frame construction, when you factor in what construction workers in the US are paid. Concrete blocks and bricks are just as susceptible as a wood house when it comes to getting hit by tornados for one. Also, there are still windows that can break creating a vacuum of pressure even if you did avoid the stick frames. Better question is probably why arent block and brick houses built where wild/forest fires are prevalent? Tornadoes will erase a cinder block house right at ground level. Most damage from hurricanes is from flooding, or from roof failures. You still need a roof on a cinder block house.

No amount of physical locks will ever make something 100% secure because even if they are unpickable, and there are some unpickable locks, physical things can be broken. The point of physical locks are that it takes the robber time and energy to get around them. If it takes more time and energy to do it most robbers will just go to the next location and hope there is less security. because of this most people just need convenient locks. Ones that do not take up a lot of space or time to open. It is only when we see extremely valuable things that the higher tech locks that take a lot of space/time/energy to work with. No point in having amazing locks when you can just kick a door down or bust a window. Locks on homes just need to be enough to keep out lazy casual thieves and curious neighborhood kids. Most residences aren't specifically chosen because a burglar wants something specific in your house, they're chosen because it's easy to get inside & take whatever might be valuable. If you're trying to secure a place that has things of particular value, you'll have far more robust security measures in place. A gun store, for example, will have bars on the windows, multiple heavy duty locks, reinforced doors **and then** also have all the guns locked up in safes overnight. It falls under one of four objectives in reduction of crime: [increasing the perceived effort of crime.]( URL_0 ) Most petty crimes are crimes of opportunity, aka: easy to get away with and little risk involved. If you have a padlock on your shed a thief needs to pick it before you or your neighbor glance out the window and see him doing it. If there was no lock to mess with the thief could go right in and take what he wanted in a matter of seconds. Funny story, I lived in a house awhile back, and the bank was selling the house next door. There was a metal shed in the back. After awhile the Realtor sign said ""sold."" A few days later I saw some guy in the neighboring house's backyard with a big white pickup, disassembling the shed and putting it into the back of the truck. It took him about three days to do this. At the time I thought he was just working for the Realtor cleaning up the place. About a week later the man who bought the house yelled at us demanding to know why we didn't call the police on the man who stole his shed. Most locks are designed to stop the casual thief, not the professional. So, they barely need to work at all to be 99% effective. Security and price. While they aren't very secure (I have learned to pick locks and know how easy they are to pick) it does provide protection to the vast majority of people who don't know how to pick locks. A example would be a convertible on the street with it's top down and $300 sticking out of a wallet. Super easy to just reach it, grab it, and keep walking. A non-convertible with an unlock door more secure, but you'll have some people pulling the door handle to see if it's unlocked and grab the wallet. While a thief who knows how to pick a lock can easily grab it, the risk of getting caught sticking some tools in a door to get it to open would pose more risk. If someone wants to get into your house and steal something specific, it's not that hard to pull off. But most break ins aren't that targeted. You would typically patrol a neighborhood and look for houses that are easy to break into. If your house is locked, burglars are more likely to just move on to a different house. Locks prevent that sort of crime. They aren't ""easy"" to pick per say. If you invest some money in a set of picks and some time in learning how to do it it isn't the hardest thing in the world - assuming it's a basic 5 or 6 pin tumbler with no additional security measures - but even 1 or 2 security or mushroom pins in a tumbler will give even an experienced locksmith a run for their money. Introduce things like dimple pins into the mix and it becomes even more difficult to pick a lock open. 9 times out of 10 it's easier to drill a lock out or snap the barrel or even break the door down, depending on why you're doing it. The reality is, if someone wants to gain access to a locked door, they will regardless of how hi-tech your lock is or how strong your door is. Short of you having like a bank style vault door there's no real upgrade to the doors/locks we use now. Source: I used to work for a locksmiths that primarily gained access to homes that the tenants were being evicted from for the local council. We almost always snapped or drilled the barrel of two way tumbers and shimmed latch locks. Picking is slow and unreliable in comparison. First, traditional locks are not easily picked, they require a degree of skill. I know how to pick a lock, but it would be much faster for me to just use a crowbar or a brick. Second, the purpose of a lock is not just security. Circumventing a lock shows you had intent to break a law, and didn't just make a mistake and walk into the wrong house.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 70.71, 'recall': 10.06, 'fmeasure': 17.62}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.83, 'recall': 2.24, 'fmeasure': 3.92}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 35.71, 'recall': 5.08, 'fmeasure': 8.9}}"

He made the observation that the number of components per processor had been doubling about every 24 months. Over time, the doubling rate actually turned out to be about every 18 months. In practice, as the number of transistors per IC doubled, so did the density. Smaller transistors can switch faster. More transistors means you can do more stuff. One interesting thing is that people have been saying Moore's Law will be over since the 70s. Continuing to shrink the dimensions of transistors has been expensive and has required enormous technological development. Many limits that people thought were fundamental have been worked around. However, right now we're approaching the point where transistors would have to become smaller than atoms. That's pretty much impossible. So the next evolution will have to be based on a new device that's fundamentally different from the silicon transistors we know now. In order to fully understand the issues, you have to know a bit about how integrated circuits are made. The ELI5 version is that they're made in a photographic process that involves shining light through a patterned plate onto a piece of silicon. Generally, the smallest image you can clearly see (or pattern) using light is limited to about half the wavelength. Visible light has wavelengths around 400-700 nanometers. Early transistors were hundreds of times larger than the wavelength used to pattern them. As transistors were made smaller, dust particles became large enough to disrupt the patterns. People invented filtration technologies and moved IC fabrication into clean rooms. Eventually transistor sizes starting getting close to the wavelengths of light. The industry started using single-wavelength sources for better resolution. The industry moved from 436 nm to 405 nm to 365 nm.. and so on. Short-wavelength light sources are harder to make with sufficient intensity. In the 1990s the industry was using 248 nm excimer lasers (not cheap!). Then they moved to 193 nm lasers. All the while, the industry found ways to ""cheat"" and make features even smaller than half the wavelength. Some tricks they developed: - Modifying the chemistry of the photo-sensitive materials used to pattern the chips. - Using oil or water in between the lenses used to focus the light and the chip surfaces to make a small lens behave like a bigger lens. - Optimizing the patterning mask geometries - Exposing the patterns in multiple steps The industry has been stuck at using 193 nm lasers. Using all the various tricks, they can currently pattern features around 20 nanometers. It's got to the point where they're making devices about as small as they can be made with out moving to smaller wavelengths. The problem is that below 193 nm, most materials absorb light very strongly, so they'll have to move from using lenses to using mirrors to focus the light. Also, making bright enough light sources has been very difficult and still hasn't been perfected yet. The industry is expected to eventually move to using extreme ultraviolet, or EUV (~14nm wavelength). To keep improving performance, Intel and others have started introducing enhanced transistor designs. Until recently transistors in CPUs were basically planar. Now, they're moving to 3D designs that can switch more efficiently. The reason we haven't done all these things from the start is that we didn't know how in some cases and that many of the technological developments have been extremely costly. We've known how to make 20-nm transistors for at least a decade using electron beams instead of light. The problem is that process is still way too slow to ever be used in production. Developing to the state of the art we have today has probably cost in the trillions of dollars or more by this point. A single EUV exposure tool is expected to run 100 million dollars when it becomes commercially available. That's 20X more expensive than a state-of-the-art tool 20 years ago. So, in short, it's a combination of economics, technological limitations, and physics. Moore's law is just a rule of thumb, really. Transistors are *so damn tiny* right now that we have to invent new technology at every single step to get them any smaller. There's no way we could have made them that small back in the 60's. For one thing, we lacked computers powerful enough to design the very transistors they needed to run. The ultimate end of Moore's law is not our ability, but rather the laws of physics themselves. With transistors and wires that small, there is a nonzero chance that electrons will quantum tunnel out of their wires and into nearby wires, and suddenly 2+2 gives you 8 and computers can't work. You cannot make a computer smaller than that.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 53.36, 'recall': 14.58, 'fmeasure': 22.91}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.01, 'recall': 2.45, 'fmeasure': 3.86}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.18, 'recall': 9.07, 'fmeasure': 14.24}}"
How UPS drivers save gas by avioding left turns.,"> How UPS drivers save gas by avioding left turns. The way to save gas is to use the most efficient route. If you're going to drive a long distance, you want to make sure you're driving the shortest distance possible, and that means avoiding left turns whenever possible. This is because left turns take more time and energy to complete than right turns. This is because you have to slow down and accelerate to turn left, whereas you can maintain speed when turning right. The same is true when driving in a city. Driving in a city is different from driving on the highway. When you're driving in a city, you're going to be turning a lot, and you want to minimize your time spent turning. This is because time spent turning is time spent not driving, which means you're not delivering packages. The UPS driver doesn't want to spend all day turning. So he'll look for the most efficient route possible, and that means avoiding left turns whenever possible. This is true of any driver, not just UPS. It's true of taxis, it's true of ambulances, it's true of delivery trucks, it's true of police cars. Driving is a job, and any job that requires you to be on the road for a long time wants to minimize the time spent turning.","UPS drivers drive a large and not very agile box truck. This means that for a left turn, they must wait, idling the engine, until a rather large gap is open across both directions of the road. (In the US, the left turn crosses to the far lane.) If their route only involved right turns, and it was the same length, then they would use less gas idling, because they would only need ot wait for a gap in the near lane. Computer software can arrange that, and thus they make left turns only when the distance traveled is significantly less than could be achieved with right turns. In the US, road networks are dense and one-way roads uncommon, this turns out to be almost never making a left turn. You get the most mileage out of your gas by travelling at faster(-than-stalling) speeds. In addition, whenever you brake, you are taking the energy you had from your gas and turning it into heat via friction with the brakes. Then you have to accelerate back up to speed again after you are done stopping. When you make more left turns, due to having to stop to wait for a break in the oncoming traffic, you stop and start more often. Turning right, on the other hand, only requires that you slow down very slightly since there's no oncoming traffic to avoid. Why is this marked NSFW? Is it because of [this?]( URL_0 ) In most US and Canadian jurisdictions, you're allowed to make right turns at a red light. You just have to yield to oncoming traffic. And if the light is green, you don't have to wait at all. Just make your turn. In the case of a left turn, you have to sit and wait at the red, then yield to oncoming traffic unless there's an advanced green. When your vehicle is sitting idling like that, you're getting somewhere in the ball park of 0 miles per gallon. You're burning fuel to go nowhere. Now for one truck, only making right turns is going isn't going to save a whole lot of fuel over the course of a day. But if you multiply that by thousands of trucks on the road all day, every day, it adds up pretty quickly.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.26, 'recall': 35.97, 'fmeasure': 45.05}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.16, 'recall': 6.65, 'fmeasure': 8.33}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.5, 'recall': 14.03, 'fmeasure': 17.57}}"
Why was the Light Emitting Diode (LED) so late entering into the game of being practical & widespread?," I understand it has to do with the fact that it's not a semiconductor, but it's still a light source. The reason why LEDs are not as bright as incandescent bulbs is because they only emit light in one direction, unlike incandescent bulbs which emit light in all directions. LEDs are made of a thin layer of gallium nitride. Gallium is a metal and nitrogen is a gas. When the two are combined, they form a crystal structure. When electricity is applied to the crystal, the electrons are excited and move around. They collide with the atoms in the crystal, which absorbs the energy and releases it as light. The reason why LEDs are so bright is because they are very efficient. They are able to convert most of the energy into light. However, the light is only emitted in one direction.   most of the light is absorbed by the crystal. It can't escape. This is why LEDs are so bright. They are able to absorb all the light and emit it in one direction. This is also why they are so efficient. They are able to convert most of the energy into light. Incandescent bulbs are very inefficient. They convert most of the energy into heat. This is why they are not as bright. They are able to emit light in all directions.  ","In comparison to fire? Or filament lights?? The quantum mechanics that predicted the performance of LEDs, and thus started the search to make them affordably, was a recent scientific discovery. Moving to shorter wavelengths, like blue, took years longer than the red ones. The key to widespread is practical. LED light bulbs in white are still 5-10 times as expensive as their incandescent counterparts. Blue is the key. If you want white light, you need a light generator that can produce a full spectrum. We were pretty good at making red and green ones LEDs, but blue was another story. The trick was finding the right combination of advanced semiconducting materials to pull it off. Blue LEDs were first developed in the early 70's, but they weren't very bright. Nowhere near bright enough to function as a practical replacement for conventional light bulbs. The next two decades were spent trying to develop a suitable material that could produce bright blue light efficiently. Key breakthrough were made in the 80's that laid the groundwork. The first high brightness blue LED wasn't invented until the early 90's by Shuji Nakamura. Two other physicists, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano were also working on blue light using Gallium Nitride (GaN) semi-conductors. A process for growing GaN on silicone wasn't successfully demonstrated until 2001. The three men went on to win the Nobel Prize for Physics thanks to their discoveries. Once we figured out how to make blue LEDs, we now had the pieces to make white ones. You do this by coating blue LEDs with certain phosphors to get the colour temperature you want. A common one is yttrium aluminium garnet, which produces the warmer yellowish-white light we humans tend to prefer. It really didn't take long after the successful silicon process was demonstrated before they entered mass production. Though early high brightness bulbs were expensive and had large, ugly heatsinks to help increase the bulb's life span and efficiency. It's only in the last 5 or so years where they've become cost competitive with florescent and incandescent lighting.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 40.97, 'recall': 25.98, 'fmeasure': 31.79}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.77, 'recall': 1.12, 'fmeasure': 1.37}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.5, 'recall': 11.73, 'fmeasure': 14.36}}"
"With so many people on a small airplane, how does the plane not run out of oxygen?"," Lots of oxygen. There are two main systems for air on a plane: the cabin air system and the flight deck air system. The cabin air system is what keeps the cabin air breathable for the passengers. This is done by a series of fans and compressors that take air from outside and compress it. The cabin air is then heated and cooled to keep the temperature at a comfortable level. The flight deck air system is what keeps the flight deck air breathable for the pilots. This is done by a series of compressors that take air from outside and compress it. The flight deck air is then heated and cooled to keep the temperature at a comfortable level. The flight deck air is also used for the flight attendants. The flight deck air system is not pressurized to the same level as the cabin air system, so it is not pressurized to the same level as the cabin air. The cabin air is pressurized to 10000 feet, while the flight deck air is pressurized to 8000 feet. The flight deck air system is pressurized to a higher level than the cabin air system because the flight deck air system is used for the flight attendants, who need to be able to breathe at a higher pressure than the passengers.  ","It pumps air in from outside. Air is compressed (the pressure outside is lower than people like) and warmed up (it is very cold outside a plane) in the engines before being pumped into the cabin. Excess air is exhausted to keep the cabin air fresh. The oxygen is circulated from the outside of the aircraft, like air con in a car but the aircraft is kept pressurised like a can of soda, by the engines. This is so people don't die of asphyxiation (where the brain is starved of oxygen) as the high altitude air has less oxygen.

Why do they have to replace the (whole) transmission? Isn't there just a part inside they can fix?," Sounds like the transmission is not functioning properly and needs to be replaced. There are a few reasons why this can happen. One reason is that the transmission fluid has been low for a while and the transmission is now damaged. Another reason is that the transmission has been driven in an abusive manner, such as racing or towing a heavy load. When a transmission is damaged, it needs to be replaced to ensure the vehicle is safe to drive.","Transmissions are very finicky fine tolerance units that require specialized tools and know-how. Average mechanic doesn't want to to open it up and dig in. It's much quicker to replace the unit than spend hours to fix a $10 inside part.. Without more context I can't give you any insight. It depends on the nature of the damage, where it may be so extensive it's cheaper to replace the whole unit than it is to pay for the man hours to disassemble and reassemble, which is a complicated, tedious, and precision based task. Like the others said, normally it's a lot easier, quicker and cheaper to replace it than try to fix it, maybe find out what's wrong, then putting it back again. The time alone would often offset the price difference between fixing it and replacing it entirely. And even then it's not even a guarantee that it'll last long or even work. I take the same approach when fixing computer problems. I can spend hours trying to locate and fix it, but most often it's a lot easier on my sanity to just reformat and start over. Disregarding a hardware problem, that fixes it. Also Am mechanic. Alternative: take it to special transmission shop to fix it.

"Why does the fridge have a lightbulb in it but the freezer compartment doesn't? Is it too cold for the filament, would the bulb heat it up too much?","The fridge light is on a dimmer switch. It's on all the time but the dimmer switch reduces the amount of power it consumes. The freezer doesn't need a light because the freezer compartment is usually much colder than the rest of the fridge. The filament in the light bulb is made of a metal called tungsten. Tungsten is a very good conductor of electricity, and it also has a very high melting point. In fact, it has the highest melting point of all the metals that are commonly used. So it can withstand the heat that comes from the fridge. But it's also a very poor conductor of heat. It's so good at conducting electricity that it can't really transfer heat very well. So it's a good conductor of electricity, but it's a poor conductor of heat. The freezer compartment is usually much colder than the rest of the fridge, so it doesn't need a light. But the fridge compartment is usually room temperature, so it needs a light to let you see inside.","Both of my freezers have lights.

Perhaps it was a heat issue and this has been resolved with the advent of LED lights? It's only really low end fridges that don't. Probably as a cost cutting measure since the freezer compartments in those fridges are usually small, and you're not going to be going in them as often. Cutting out the switch, socket, and associated wiring is going to save a couple bucks on each unit, which can add up on bulk orders. Most-mid to high end fridges do have a light in both compartments these days.

"What exactly does brake fluid do? What makes it work more than another substance, say something like water?","n.b. I'm a noob at this, so please don't go too in depth. I'm just trying to get a basic idea. Brake fluid is a special liquid that is used in the braking system of a car. It is used to transfer the force generated by the brake pedal to the brake pads. The brake pads are made of a material that is designed to clamp onto the rotors and slow them down. The rotors are attached to the wheels. When you press the brake pedal, it activates a master cylinder, which fills the brake fluid reservoir with brake fluid. The brake fluid flows through a system of pipes and hoses, and eventually reaches the brake caliper. The brake caliper is a device that contains the brake pads. When the brake fluid reaches the brake caliper, it causes the brake pads to move towards the rotors. As the brake pads move towards the rotors, they clamp onto the rotors and slow them down. The rotors are attached to the wheels, so when the rotors slow down, the wheels slow down, and the car stops. The brake fluid is designed to be very viscous, meaning it has a high viscosity.  ","These are glycol-based hydraulic fluids that are not appreciably compressible, non-toxic, biodegradable, hydroscopic, and have extremely high boiling points. That's key for a system that converts motion into heat through friction. Your brake system can easily hit several hundred degrees, and the hydraulic system can itself rise a couple hundred degrees through conduction and radiant heat. Water will boil and turn to steam in your brake system, which becomes a compressible spring. That doesn't mean you get an additional spring force pressing on your brakes, that means you have a spring absorbing all the force you're applying to the brakes. This is a foot-to-the-floor-and-you-ain't-stopping sort of problem. This is why it's important to keep that cap on your master brake cylinder - your brake fluid will actually pull moisture out of the atmosphere. Also, don't keep bottles of old brake fluid around, they, too, can collect water from the atmosphere. It has a high boiling point so it does not vaporize in your brake lines like water would do. Brake fluids biggest advantage is that it takes a lot of heat to boil. The liquid isn't compressible (or not nearly as much) but if it were gas it would be. It also acts as a lubricant for the breaking system. The brake pedal compresses the fluid which in turn pushes on the brake pads and drums, creating friction with the spinning wheel thus slowing it down. The friction of braking creates a substantial amount of heat, and the fluid must have a high boiling point to prevent vaporizing in the hydraulics. Water would boil, creating vapor in the line that would disrupt the hydraulics, thus causing the braking system to fail. The fluid also must maintain a stable viscosity at different temperatures and not corrode parts it comes in contact with. Now is my time to tell it how it was. My stepdad and my first new car (5mi off the lot, just a Malibu, but still) in his great genius decided that my brake fluid was low...^^because ^^he ^^drained ^^it. But, he had some power steering fluid and decided since both are ""hydraulic fluids"" that they should work interchangeably. Long story short, a month later I had to have the entire brake line system removed as the steering fluid corroded them. I've got lots of stories about his smarts. This was one of my favorites. Brake fluid is basically hydraulic fluid but with several properties that make it useful in automotive braking systems. Needs to be non corrosive Needs to be thin enough to flow easily in small tubes but thick enough to prevent foaming or break up. Needs to be stable at a variety of temperatures. Water would corrode the metal of the brake system and it would be unstable and freeze at low temperature, and might boil off or explode at high temperature. Regular motor oil would be very good at preventing corrosion or being sensitive to high temperature but it may be to thick to flow properly through small brake lines especially when cold. So brake fluid is engineered to have these properties as well as as not attacking seals and gaskets in the reservoir.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.58, 'recall': 22.89, 'fmeasure': 33.38}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.36, 'recall': 5.32, 'fmeasure': 7.76}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.6, 'recall': 9.89, 'fmeasure': 14.42}}"
What engineering limits are keeping modern passenger planes from going more than ~600 miles per hour?," tl;dr: There is no engineering limit that would prevent modern passenger planes from going faster. There are some political limits that are preventing it, and some of those are due to the FAA. The only reason we don't have 700mph planes is because the FAA won't allow it. **TL;DR:** There's no engineering reason for them not to go faster. There are political reasons that the FAA won't allow it. It's been done before. The Concorde was capable of reaching speeds of over Mach 2, but it was a commercial failure. The main reason is that it was very expensive and only a few airlines operated it. The Concorde was also a very noisy plane, so it had to be kept at a distance from populated areas. The other reason is that it was not allowed to fly over land. The Concorde was a supersonic jet that could reach speeds of over Mach 2. The Concorde was a commercial failure, but it was a great engineering success. It was very expensive to operate, but it was also very fast.   it had to fly over the ocean. The Concorde was also very noisy, so it had to be kept at a distance from populated areas.  ","The biggest one is actually political. Breaking the sound barrier makes a lot of noise and makes people grumpy. That's the main reason we haven't done it again since the Concorde, there's just too much pushback; though companies are working on quieter supersonic jets to help with it You'll notice that most commercial jets top out around mach 0.8, there's a reason for that! Between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2 you're in the ""transonic region"" and the math gets icky. Some parts of the plane have air moving over them at the speed of sound, others have it moving slower, its not a good place to be so you want to fly faster! The Concorde did Mach 2.0 meaning it was only briefly in the transonic region before getting into full supersonic A supersonic plane needs a much different shape than a subsonic plane. Lift doesn't work the same at those high speeds, big wide wings are just going to rip off, you end up with swept wings that are closer to the body and narrower which reduces drag at high speed, unfortunately this means that your plane isn't very good at subsonic speed And we're back to point #1, politics. You can make a plane good at being supersonic or you can make a plane good at being subsonic but you can't make a plane good at both so you either have a plane you can only fly over the ocean that goes really quick, or a plane you can fly anywhere that goes slower, but you can't have a really quick plane that flies anywhere right now. The speed of sound is a mofo. Some of the design problems are here: URL_0 The problems are solvable, but not efficiently. In general, it's not just that the cost needs to come down, but that it needs to come down relative to subsonic flight, so that people will pay for the express. 1. Supersonic flight burns a lot of gas and this means tickets are going to be expensive. 2. Burning a lot of gas means that you can't do the real long haul flights like LA to Tokyo or whatever, which is where being able to go really fast would give you the greatest benefit. Also, the noise from the sonic boom means that supersonic flight is mostly going to be over the ocean. 3. Unless you're on one of these real long haul flights (which supersonic airliners can't do) then it's entirely possible that most of your journey is going to be spent in a cab going to the airport, then dicking around in line at the ticket counter, then going through security etc etc etc rather than actually in the air flying. 4. The fact that you can lease an executive jet these days means that the kind of people who could regularly blow thousands of dollars on a supersonic flight have another option that costs about the same, takes about as much time (considering the whole journey) and is vastly more comfortable. Cost benefit ratio. Air resistance increases exponentially the faster you go which means exponential fuel consumption. And also breaking the sound barrier also causes other problems itself too. Limits of fluid dynamics as result of laws of physics. The faster you go, the more air molecules you have to shove aside. Fuel isn't free. Nobody cares to pay $10000 a ticket to get there 5 hours sooner. The faster you go the more air resistance that you meet. The more air resistance the more fuel you have to burn to maintain that speed. There is nothing necessarily stopping commercial planes from going super sonic except for some laws about super sonic flight over populated areas, but its just not economical. There are a lot of changes that occur as a plane hits supersonic speed. The flow of air through the engine, the heat generated by air compression, and the vibrations of the shockwave all have to be incorporated into the design of the aircraft for it to survive supersonic flight. And even if you do all those, fuel efficiency plummets.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.43, 'recall': 18.22, 'fmeasure': 28.1}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.88, 'recall': 4.1, 'fmeasure': 6.33}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.62, 'recall': 8.19, 'fmeasure': 12.64}}"
Can you detonate a bullet with blunt force?," Different types of ammunition can be affected by different types of force, and some of those forces can cause a bullet to detonate. For example, the impact of a high-velocity rifle bullet can cause the bullet to penetrate the target and then shatter into fragments, but this does not necessarily mean that the bullet has detonated. Some types of ammunition, however, are designed to be detonated by the impact of a bullet. This is typically done with armor-piercing ammunition, which is designed to penetrate armor. The force of the bullet hitting the armor is sufficient to cause the explosive to detonate, and this can destroy the armor. This is not a common occurrence, though, and is only done in very specialized circumstances.","Yes you can, and the danger isn't so much with the projectile on this one as it is with the metal fragments of the case. It's not guaranteed to shred open but since there's no chamber rugulating it, it gets a little crazy sometime's. Without a chamber it's not as powerful either, so you wouldn't be able to use it to hit stuff very easily, but it could still hurt you and has a better chance of being unpredictable. the primer on a bullet contains a crystaline form of mercury fulminate. in a rim-fire bullet, this is in the base of the cartridge. to fire the bullet, you need to hit the primer hard enough to break the crystal of mercury fulminate, at which point it will spontaneously decompose, releasing a LOT of heat, which will then detonate the powder charge. it's totaly possible to detonate a bullet by handling it incorrectly. i've detonated .22lr by dropping it off a table. the brass of the primer is there to hold the mercury fulminate in place, AND protect it so that only a carefully placed blow will detonate it. Yes. That's what your gun does. A gun works by striking a bullet with blunt force at exactly the right spot. If you did the same you could trigger ignition without a gun. Most bullets are designed to make this difficult for safety. But if you mimic the action of the firing pin striking the bullet it will go off. > can you hit it hard (like with a golf club or hammer) enough to make it fire? This would be much easier with a rimfire cartridge as centerfire would have the primer more protected in the center of the back of the cartridge. Whacking it hard enough should dent it and set off the round.

What exactly does it mean for something to be scalable and why does it have to be this way?,"Scalability is a property of a system that allows it to grow in size without a corresponding decrease in performance. It's often used as a buzzword in the context of cloud computing, but it can be applied to any system. For example, if you're building a system that will be handling more data in the future, you might want to design it to be able to handle a larger volume of data. This is a scalable system. You might also design it to be able to handle a larger number of users, or to be able to handle a higher load of queries. Scalability is important because it allows you to build systems that can grow with demand. If you're building a system that can't handle a larger volume of data, or a larger number of users, then you'll have to build a new system. This can be expensive and time-consuming, and you might end up with two systems that are incompatible with each other. By designing your system to be scalable, you can avoid this problem. There are several ways to design a system to be scalable. One common approach is to use a distributed architecture, where the system is broken up into smaller pieces that can be distributed across multiple servers. Each piece can be designed to handle a smaller volume of data, or a smaller number of users, so that if one piece fails, the rest of the system will still be able to function.","If your business is scalable then it has solved the tradesman's problem. Consider a chef. To make the world's best food, you have to know exactly when to flip the steak at just the right time and temperature. That's a unique skill that not just anyone can do. Being the best at it allows you to charge a hefty premium and make more money per-steak. However, you're limited in how much more you can charge because eventually the 2nd best guy will be good enough. You can't open a second location because the guy flipping steaks at that location doesn't do it as well as you do and therefore can't justify the obscenely high price you do. A business that is perfectly scalable doesn't depend on any one particular person, place, or resource. It works anywhere and everywhere, and only requires $X to get started, and can expect Y% return, provided you find people that are generally good enough to do their jobs and fit into your model. Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. A system whose performance improves after adding hardware, proportionally to the capacity added, is said to be a scalable system. As far as why it has to be that way, I'd say the description of that type of system is pretty self-explanatory. Let me put it a different way than /u/Ameos: A scale-able system can be upgraded to handle more work. A system that is not scale-able would need to be replaced in order to handle more work.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 45.28, 'recall': 40.07, 'fmeasure': 42.51}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.67, 'recall': 9.44, 'fmeasure': 10.02}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.08, 'recall': 17.77, 'fmeasure': 18.85}}"
"Why are most boats operated/captained from the right side, but autos and airplanes on the left?","Because of the way the wheels are aligned. If you look at a car, the wheels are aligned so that the center of the car is in line with the center of the wheel. If you look at a boat, the wheels are aligned so that the center of the boat is in line with the center of the wheel. In the case of the boat, the center of the boat is the steering wheel, and the center of the wheel is the point where the steering shaft connects to the rudder. This means that when you turn the wheel, the rudder also turns. This is also true of an airplane, but the airplane's rudder is called ailerons, and it is controlled by the elevator, which is the control surface that moves the elevator to change the angle of attack. In the case of a boat, the rudder is controlled by the steering wheel, which is attached to the steering shaft. In the case of an airplane, the rudder is controlled by the elevator, which is attached to the elevator control stick. When you turn the elevator control stick, the elevator moves, which changes the angle of attack, which in turn changes the direction of the airplane. The rudder is attached to the elevator control stick, so when you turn the elevator control stick, the rudder also turns.  ","It has to do with where the rudder oar was placed on boats before fixed rudders were invented. That oar was on the right side so that side was the Steerboard (later starboard) side. The left side was therefore the side that went next to the dock (port side). As for cars. That has to do with the driving practices of wagons. Originally you sat in the middle behind your single horse. As teams of horses got bigger you eventually had them running two abreast. So you had to choose which one you wanted to be the lead. Some countries made the front left horse the lead, some the front right. You sat on the appropriate side of the wagon for the placement of the horse you were directing. That became the side of the car that you sat on when they were invented. With planes you sit in the middle, unless they are large enough to have two pilots seats. Either can control the plane. I'm not sure the assertion that most boats are operated on the right side is true. It certainly is true for most recreational powerboats that have side by side cockpit seating, but a large number of powerboats are also center console. Sailboat cockpits are also mostly centered. And many larger boats have multiple control locations. For recreational powerboats, one of the main reasons is throttle location. Most people are used to controlling throttle with their right side of their bodies. On most motorcycles, jet skis, etc., the throttle is on the right-hand grip. In automobiles, the gas pedal is on the right. For powerboats, the throttle is generally to the right of the steering wheel. So for small, bow-rider style power boats when it comes to choosing left or right side, most will go with the right side so the throttle can be to the right of the steering wheel. If it were to the left, by the pass-through, people could accidentally hit the throttle which would be a safety concern.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.98, 'recall': 30.21, 'fmeasure': 36.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.53, 'recall': 7.06, 'fmeasure': 8.45}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.76, 'recall': 17.3, 'fmeasure': 20.7}}"
"if locks and keys have specific grooves so only certain keys work, how to GM keys work?","It's a security feature to prevent theft. If you lose your key, you can't make a copy of it, so you can't drive the car away. The ""chip"" inside the key is the reason for this. It's not a physical chip, but rather a digital one, stored on a microchip in the key. When the key is inserted into the car, the microchip is read and verified. If the code is correct, the car will start. If not, it won't. The code is stored on the key and can't be changed.","Bluecollarbiker is right. But I just spent 20 minutes trying to figure this out for you, and a little extra detail couldn't hurt. When you open a door, you put the key in a cylinder. When the cylinder turns, the lock opens. A lock has a set of metal pins (tiny rods, basically). The metal pins enter the cylinder, and they also go into a part of the lock that doesn't turn. The pins prevent the cylinder from turning. Every pin is actually divided into two parts. If it was just one solid piece, you could push it up as far as it would go, and the cylinder would turn, and your lock would suck. Each groove of a key pushes up enough so that the top half of the pin leaves the cylinder. The bottom half of the pin remains, but since it is totally within the cylinder, the cylinder can turn. If you went up any higher than that, the bottom half of the pin would push out of the cylinder, and the lock wouldn't open. With a master key, they add what is called a master wafer between the two halfs of the pin. Basically, it's a tiny metal hockey puck. What this means is that each pin is effectively three pieces. Because it is three pieces, there are two breaks in each pin. If you raise the top part of the pin AND the wafer, the bottom part of the pin remains entirely in the cylinder, and the lock opens. If you raise the top part of the pin, but NOT the wafer, the wafer and the bottom part remain entirely in the cylinder, and the lock opens. So each pin has two possible ways to open it. One possibility will be the same on every lock, and the other possibility is unique to each lock. Normal keys open the unique possibility, and master keys open the shared possibility. I think (might be wrong), that a grand master lock would have two wafers, thereby creating three possibilities on every lock. For every lock, possibility A will be the same, so the grand master unlocks it. Possibility B will change, with one unique configuration for each master key. Any lock opened by a particular master key will have the same B possibility. Possibility C will be unique to every lock, and can only be opened by the regular key.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 63.92, 'recall': 15.27, 'fmeasure': 24.65}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.29, 'recall': 1.73, 'fmeasure': 2.79}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 38.14, 'recall': 9.11, 'fmeasure': 14.71}}"
Why are purely mechanical machines seen as more ingenious than their electronic counterparts?," Purely mechanical machines are seen as more ingenious because they require more skill and knowledge to build, as well as more forethought and planning. In order to create a purely mechanical machine, the engineer must have a deep understanding of the physics of the machine and how it will work. They must also have a good understanding of the materials and the tools that they will be using to build it. In contrast, electronic machines are much easier to build and require much less knowledge. This is because electronic machines are built using transistors, which are tiny electronic devices that can be easily manufactured and are much more reliable than their mechanical counterparts. Transistors are also much faster than mechanical parts, which means that electronic machines are faster and more efficient. However, this does not mean that purely mechanical machines are more ingenious. In fact, electronic machines are often more ingenious because they require much less forethought and planning. This is because the transistors in electronic machines can be easily integrated into a circuit board, which makes it easy to test the machine and make any necessary adjustments. In contrast, mechanical machines are much more difficult to test and make adjustments to, which means that they are less efficient and more prone to malfunction.

What use do multiple exhausts have on automobiles?,"The exhaust system is one of the most important parts of an automobile. It's job is to remove the gases that are produced by the engine and release them into the atmosphere. The exhaust system is made up of a number of different parts, including the exhaust manifold, the catalytic converter, the oxygen sensor, the muffler, and the tailpipe. The exhaust manifold is a pipe that connects the engine to the catalytic converter. The catalytic converter is a device that converts harmful gases into less harmful gases. The oxygen sensor is a device that measures the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas and uses that information to adjust the fuel/air mixture in the engine. The muffler is a device that reduces the noise of the exhaust. The tailpipe is a pipe that connects the muffler to the outside atmosphere. The exhaust system is a very important part of the automobile. It's job is to remove the gases that are produced by the engine and release them into the atmosphere. If the exhaust system were not working properly, the gases would build up in the engine compartment and cause serious damage to the engine. The exhaust system is also important for the engine's performance. The gases that are produced by the engine are used to fuel the engine. If the exhaust system is not working properly, the engine will not run as well.","Primarily their function is to move as much volume of exhaust as possible. In the case of cars with larger engines this means larger amounts of exhaust are created. Instead of having one single pipe with a big diameter, they use multiple pipes with smaller diameters to create the exhaust. This is a ELI5 so i didnt go into other functions like newer cars will regulate how many of the exhausts are being used to control backpressure at different RPMs/throttle levels, and also to control the sound, efficiency etc etc. But still TL;DR:, primarily, more power = more explosions = more exhaust created = more exhaust pipes. It's worth meantioning too that ground clearance is at a premium in cars. Four 4 inch pipes gives you far more clearance than one big 8 inch pipe.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 17.3, 'recall': 30.37, 'fmeasure': 22.04}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.97, 'recall': 5.22, 'fmeasure': 3.78}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 10.13, 'recall': 17.78, 'fmeasure': 12.9}}"
How do they build underwater tunnels and seal them?,"They don't build underwater tunnels. They build underwater pipelines. Pipelines are made of steel or plastic. They are not sealed in the classical sense. They are simply buried in the ground with a layer of gravel on top. The gravel is to protect the pipe from being punctured by animals. There are a few ways to seal a pipeline. One way is to have a seal in the pipeline at both ends. This is done by welding a piece of pipe on the end of the pipe, then welding a piece of pipe on the other end. The welded piece is then cut off, leaving a pipe that is sealed at both ends. Another way is to use a welding process called ""hot tapping"". This is done by drilling a hole in the pipe, then inserting a small metal plug into the hole. The plug is then welded into place, effectively sealing the pipe. A third way is to use a specialized sealant. This is used by some pipelines, particularly those that are used for oil and gas.  alant is applied to the inside of the pipe, then the pipe is closed and the sealant is allowed to harden.  alant is usually a special type of cement, or a mixture of cement and other chemicals.  ","underwater tunnels are often created with humongous tunnel-boring machines (TBMs) — sometimes called moles. These machines cost millions of dollars, but they can create large tunnels in a very short time. A circular plate with disk cutters rotates to cut through rock as the machine inches forward slowly. As the machine excavates the tunnel, it also helps to build the walls that will eventually support the tunnel. France and England used 11 massive TBMs to create — in just three short years — the three tubes that make up the 32-mile Channel Tunnel. Also called the Euro Tunnel or Chunnel, these tunnels now connect the two countries under the English Channel. Another new method of creating underwater tunnels is the cut-and-cover method. To use this method, builders dig a trench in the riverbed or ocean floor. They then sink pre-made steel or concrete tubes in the trench. After the tubes are covered with a thick layer of rock, workers connect the sections of tubes and pump out any remaining water. This method was used to create the Ted Williams Tunnel, which connects the southern part of Boston with Logan Airport.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 29.63, 'recall': 33.33, 'fmeasure': 31.37}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.26, 'recall': 3.66, 'fmeasure': 3.45}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 16.67, 'recall': 18.75, 'fmeasure': 17.65}}"
why can't we eliminate traffic jams on major highways?," In short, it's not possible to eliminate traffic jams on major highways.

","Okay, I'm an engineering student (aerospace/mechanical), but I do a lot of studying of it on the side. Let me tell you, this is something I'm passionate about. & nbsp; **There are are few things that cause traffic on highways: (And this is the tl;dr)** * Merging * Number of Lanes (see merging) * Amount of bypasses * Backroad availability * Car spacing & nbsp; & nbsp; Let's look at **merging**. In my opinion, this is by far the biggest issue. I live in Orlando, and if you have been here recently, we are expanding I-4 to contain - I believe - six lanes on each side. This is a *horrible* idea. It is a two-dimensional idea; if there are too many cars on the road, building more lanes will allow them to flow better, yes? Well, no... not exactly. The reason behind this is merging. The biggest causes of *any* car accident is either: merging, rear-ending (touching that later), and backing up. The latter is almost completely irrelevant to highway flow. One thing to understand about merging is that sometimes it's caused by construction (adding irony to the I-4 project). Another is lack of oversight. Sometimes - and I'll use Altomonte Springs as an example (fellow Orlandians relate) - a highway is built, and is not imagined to expect a surge in traffic in the near future. With Altomonte, there is an exit with a major intersection (St. Rd. 436) that funnels an endless amount of cars. With people traveling from Lake Mary, DeBary, Sanford, etc, and all the thru-traffic being added with a never ending funneling of cars, a bottleneck occurs quickly. So adding more lanes does not help. [Adam Conover explains this well in his show]( URL_3 ) (Can't find a clip of the show unfortunately). & nbsp; The way to fix this would be to funnel traffic in a proper pattern with the **right number of lanes**. [Here is an example]( URL_8 ) (sorry for simplicity) that I made showing how traffic could be fixed. Similar to a **HOV lane**, but instead it's designed for *thru-traffic*. This is traffic that is either trying to go through most - if not all - of an entire city whether the commute is on the opposite side of town, or the driver is on a road-trip. This allows minimal stopping for people exiting. Now, the second half is the *exiting bypass*, and this allows people who need to - let's say - get off between Exit's 83-86 near downtown, people don't have to stop for people merging. The goal is to funnel people into as few lanes as possible. If you've ever seen a river, as long as water doesn't get squeezed into a small funnel-shape, then it will flow smoothly no matter how wide. If people don't merge, this stops a lot of accidents and ""*Snakes*"" in the road if you will. & nbsp; The next is **bypass** ability. Even with my idea, there will be back-up without sufficient bypasses for people who are not driving *straight through* the city. Let's say you're trying to get from Deltona to Titusville. Titusville is located Southeast of Deltona, so instead of driving through a city, and then *merging* into lanes to go east, it's easier to go the *hypotenuse* route, which is usually a *loop*. Thing is here in Florida, we have nothing but [freaking tolls!]( URL_6 ) Everything in yellow are bottleneck roads with traffic lights and businesses. The only *free* way through is down I-4. This adds to the stress. Believe me, [Atlanta]( URL_2 ), [New York]( URL_5 ), and [Los Angeles]( URL_0 ) are no picnic either. This asks a major question, how efficient are bypasses? Well, they too need to change design, because they can become worse than the main interstate through the city; Atlanta how I hear you calling. & nbsp; **Back roads** are key to alleviating traffic. In Kansas City, the highways have a tendency to backup quite horribly. But they clear in thirty to sixty minutes, while *so* many cities (Orlando) can have it last for almost three hours. The reason is the ability for people to get off when they need to. KC has a grid system as do many cities. It's not a gorgeous design, but it is most effective. People can get off the interstate early and hit a road that goes straight for dozens of miles, and on top of that, many neighborhoods have thru-roads. This is the complete opposite in Orlando. Only downtown has a grid. There are no guarantees that a road will continue in a straight manner for very long. Neighborhoods have *no freaking thru-roads*. This is mostly because of lakes. There's a ton of them around here. But with that, the city needs to find a way to go around and alleviate traffic. One bizarre manner looks like [this]( URL_7 ). We have a dozen or so of these bridges everywhere. Missouri is working on making highways more efficient and was the first state to implement [Diverging diamond interchanges]( URL_1 ) in Springfield, and almost every bridge they construct now over an interstate is of this design, and it eliminates left turns onto the interstate in intersections that don't have space for *cloverleaf* designs. It has proved to be very quick, efficient, and effective. & nbsp; The final thing to note is **spacing between cars**. When a bottleneck occurs and people brake, it causes others to do the same creating a ""*Snake*"" effect. I think [CGP Grey]( URL_4 ) explains it best in his video about how people need to maintain distance away from a car. Great story, once I was driving down I-4 to one of the theme parks, and of course there was a bottleneck. I decided to keep my car going slow, and I maintained 15 mph while the cars in front would go like 35 mph and then slam their brakes into a full ten second stop. But, that gave me room to maneuver while they waited and then started up again. What's better, is that the person behind me did the same thing and maintained a good two-hundred foot or so gap between our cars. And on top of that, no one saw the gap around my car and decided to zoom into the gap. In essence, **This other driver and I ended a freaking Orlando, FL bottleneck!** Regardless, the solution to traffic is long and complex, and this post only hits the tip of the iceberg. The contents of this post are a combination of my opinions, observations, and content I gathered from other media platforms. Take them as you will. If you got this far, you are either magical, or a reader who skips to the end. Either way, thanks. **EDIT:** grammar and stuff I'm not an engineer but I play one at work. Traffic jams are caused by one thing and one thing only: people slowing down. Adding more lanes does not actually reduce traffic jams because there are always ""pinch points"". That famous building next to the road? We can't tear it down to make more lanes so no matter how many lanes you build before you reach the building you are funneling people into fewer lanes to get around the famous building, which causes them to slow down. Picture a stop light. Everyone in line is stopped when the light turns green. What happens next? The first guy in line starts to go, and then a few second later the second guy goes, the a few seconds later the third guy goes. We now have lost capacity on the roadway because the guys later in line didn't start going at the same time as the first guy. depending on the number of cars at the light this could impact that travel lanes a mile behind the light as the further back you are from the light the later you start to accelerate. They have done math before to calculate traffic. They found out that a car cutting off a semi can make traffic up to 2 miles behind it come to a dead stop. URL_0 I'm surprised no one's mentioned it yet, but sometimes adding lanes will increase traffic. If you merge on the highway on the right side and want/need to get over to the far left, the more lanes you cross, the longer it will take you, which also ties in to the second point: The number one cause for both traffic and accidents is *incompetent driving*. For an overly simplified example say you have x ppl in 1 lane spaced evenly apart. The 1st guy touches his breaks for no reason (happens outrageously often), the distance between him and the 2nd guy shrinks. 2nd guy touches the breaks but a little harder, to let the distance get back to what it used to be. 3rd guy does the same. Eventually 1 guy and everybody behind him come to a complete stop. This obsession with touching the pedals, breaking and accelerating over and over again will cause frequent total stops, aka rush hour traffic. I get really triggered when people with nothing in front of them, going exactly the speed limit, tap their fucking breaks for literally no reason. > _ <","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.34, 'recall': 7.26, 'fmeasure': 12.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.78, 'recall': 1.15, 'fmeasure': 2.03}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.5, 'recall': 4.39, 'fmeasure': 7.77}}"

If you have water on the road surface, then a slick tyre can end up with a layer of water between the tyre and the road, something known as aquaplaning. This causes problems with braking and steering, and so is clearly not a good thing. Tyre treads are designed to move water away from the area, thus allowing rubber to contact the road instead of sitting on a film of water. Slick tires with no treads would work well enough on dry surfaces, but on wet road, water would become trapped between the tire and the ground, causing the tire to lose traction. Treads solve the problem by providing channels the water can be pushed into, allowing the rubber of the tire to keep better contact with the road. You're right. There is a reason why the tires of F1 cars are completely bare/smooth (slick tires). It helps them to grip the road better than regular grooved tires, especially when turning at 150km/h. However, this only works when the asphalt is bone dry. In wet conditions, slick tires become completely useless because of a process called aquaplaning, in which water gets between the flat surface of the tire and the ground beneath it. This causes the tire to lose traction as it loses contact with the ground and the car will begin to lose control. Slick tires aren't allowed for common road vehicles as they aren't safe in wet weather conditions at all. Tire treads in grooved tires act as channels for water to pass through the tire whilst allowing for as much contact with the ground as possible, preventing aquaplaning from occurring. The slight grip loss from having tire treads is negligible as compared to the increased safety in wet weather conditions, or any condition in which there is liquid. It would be far easier and far safer to increase the tire width by a centimeter or two to compensate for the small loss in grip.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 35.68, 'recall': 19.3, 'fmeasure': 25.05}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.63, 'recall': 0.88, 'fmeasure': 1.14}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.41, 'recall': 13.74, 'fmeasure': 17.84}}"
What really happens when everyone in a building flushes their toilets at the exact same time?,"There are many factors that determine how many gallons of water are used in a building at any given time. If you are talking about a large building, it would be a lot of gallons, but it's not going to be the case for every toilet being flushed at the same time. If you are talking about a small office building, it's going to be a lot of gallons. But, there's a lot of variables that go into this.  ","We did this at our High School back a lonnnngggg time ago. After a few unsuccessful attempts due to lack of timing we initiated ""Operation Royal Flush Phase IV"". At the bell all toilets were to be flushed, all taps turned on at the sinks. All tolled there were probably two or three hundred fixtures. At the bell we all did our thing...I was in the B-200 wing Men's washroom... Flush.......a slow gurgle.....the water down the trap . a low rumble.....then.....you could feel it coming.......every toilet and sink literally exploded with regurgitated liquid.....hitting the fan......omg nothing so grand had ever been seen before it was a total success. Even more so as they had to close the school for a week to get it back in shape.... Two things will happen. 1. Water supply pressure will drop. If you have a high building, water could flow back to lower sinks by gravity. 2. An air bubble will be trapped inside the sewer lines. Between the flush of floor 1 and the flushes of floors above. This air bubble wants to get out of the way. The air will take the easiest route, which could result in your toilet ""exploding"" or pushing all water back trough the sifon. The sifon is the j shape that prevents smells from leaving the sewer. We used to have this problem with our toilet on heavy rain. All the water would storm its way down the sewer pipes. And since we were at the lower part of town, the air pushed away by the water would let our toilet ""explode"" the sifon contents on the ceiling. An extra vent was placed in the streets to be the easiest path for the air. It has not happened since then. If it's a modern building and there are no obstructions in the waste line, the toilets will all flush normally. The water service is sized to supply every fixture at the same time. The waste lines are as well. Edit - Apparently that isn't true for a skyscraper though, I never built one of those. Alright, So, I was doing my Fire Inspector training and I was able to test this at a newly built NFL stadium about 4 years ago. We called it the ""Super bowl."" We recruited local Girl and Boy Scout organizations, schools, and had volunteers sign up to flush all the toilets in the stadium at exactly the same time. The purpose of this was to test the plumbing and simulating ""half-time"" when most attendees go to the restroom. As the local fire department we were assessing the stadiums ability to handle that much pressure loss. The reasoning is the sprinkler systems require a certain amount of pressure and we wanted to simulate the worst case scenario: Fire during half-time when everyone is busy flushing shit, literally. Tldr; Fire department I was at did this at a NFL stadium being constructed. We had volunteers flush all the toilets as a stress test, called it the ""Super bowl."" Nothing exploded. Edit: Inclusion. Edit 2: System we inspected was getting its water supply from a small body of water nearby. Our fire department was ensuring that this eco-friendly water system was capable of handling a heavy workload (bunch of flushing at same time) and still maintain enough pressure for fire sprinklers while being stressed. Obviously the answer is ""the waste lines will revolt, backup from the pressure and spray your entire bathroom and kitchen with liquid shit."" This very test is done at large stadium venues before they open to the public. The Don and Mike radio show did a stunt at Jack Kent Cook stadium (now FedEx Field) where participants would poop in the toilets first. Iirc they had to do this in a South American city. Due to water rationing the waste wasn't getting discharged properly, causing a severe blockage. There was an episode of Ahh Real Monsters about this exact thing. During Superbowl everyone shits and flushes at the same time and the monsters in the sewers use the sudden rush of water to do an annual race on.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 68.29, 'recall': 7.99, 'fmeasure': 14.3}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.28, 'recall': 2.0, 'fmeasure': 3.59}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.15, 'recall': 3.99, 'fmeasure': 7.15}}"
What is the purpose of hackathons and why are these marathon learning sessions not as popular in other professions?," Certainly! Hackathons are events where teams come together to solve a problem or build a project. They’re often focused on technology, but can be applied to any field. The purpose of a hackathon is to bring people together to share ideas and solve problems. The term “hackathon” is derived from the idea of hacking, which was originally used to describe the creative and innovative ways that people would modify computers and computer systems. Hackathons are often held in a competitive format, with teams competing against each other to build the best solution. The goal is to create a product that can be used by real people, and to show that the team can work together to solve a problem in a short amount of time. The term “marathon” is used to describe the length of time that teams are given to work on their projects. The idea is that teams will work as hard as they can for a long period of time, and that they’ll be able to accomplish a lot in that time. Hackathons are popular in technology because it’s a field where creativity and innovation are often rewarded. Many technology companies hold hackathons, and they’re often used as a way to attract new talent. For example, Google holds a hackathon every year, and the winner is given a job at Google.  ","Programming, for anyone who's never tried it, is a very focus-intensive activity, and can be not strenuous at all. These things make marathon learning very useful, as new information can easily be picked up and utilized. (That is to say, you could learn how to use a function and then be able to use that function proficiently in mere seconds.) Compare that to math, which is hard to understand intuitively at most levels. Learning new math tricks takes time, so marathon learning is not a generally good idea in math. Or compare that to history, which must be learned sequentially and intensively for a student to create generate something worth reading. Or compare that to pottery, which is not a high-focus field and thus is not suitable for long sessions in which students may become bored. Many companies will use hackathons to get programmers or students to learn how to use a specific language, API, hardware, etc. Sometimes, hackathons are just ""hey, go work with other people and make something cool.""","{'rouge1': {'precision': 30.26, 'recall': 39.66, 'fmeasure': 34.33}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.52, 'recall': 4.62, 'fmeasure': 4.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.6, 'recall': 17.82, 'fmeasure': 15.42}}"
Does cambering your car wheels actually have any benefit?,"There are a few reasons why cambering your car wheels can be beneficial. 1. Better steering response: If your front wheels are pointing inwards and your rear wheels are pointing outwards, you'll have better steering response and less understeer. This is because the wheels are better aligned with the steering wheel, so the car will respond more quickly. 2. Better handling: If your front wheels are pointing inwards and your rear wheels are pointing outwards, you'll have better handling, especially in corners.   will be more stable and the wheels will be better able to maintain traction. 3. Better braking performance: If your front wheels are pointing inwards and your rear wheels are pointing outwards, you'll have better braking performance.   will be more stable when braking and the wheels will be better able to absorb the impact of the brakes. 4. Better stability at high speeds: If your front wheels are pointing inwards and your rear wheels are pointing outwards, you'll have better stability at high speeds.   will be more stable and the wheels will be better able to maintain traction. 5. Better fuel efficiency: If your front wheels are pointing inwards and your rear wheels are pointing outwards, you'll have better fuel efficiency.  ","A tiny amount of negative camber helps during high speed turns where all the weight transfers to the outside wheels and the tyres deform by a degree or two. F1 cars typically run with 1, maybe 2 degrees of negative camber to keep the tyre wear from cornering more even (and hence last as long as possible before needing a pitstop). If you're not driving in a way that involves tons of lateral G-force then it's not worth it. While negative camber (leaning the top of the tire in towards the car) is beneficial for cornering, it can be overdone. If it's to far negative like in stanced vehicles, it becomes worse than having no camber at all. If you have a 6 inch wide tire that only touches the pavement on the inside 2 to 3 inches, it would be the same as having a 2 to 3 inch wide tire with no camber. People stance their vehicles to look good, not perform good.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 17.31, 'recall': 21.3, 'fmeasure': 19.1}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.93, 'recall': 2.38, 'fmeasure': 2.13}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 10.1, 'recall': 12.43, 'fmeasure': 11.14}}"
How is the pattern on a key chosen? And how are they all different so that two keys cannot open the same door?," Sounds like a fun question. I'm a mechanical engineer and I've worked on a lot of locks, so I'll try to give you a good answer. I'm not an expert on locks, but I've been involved in the design of a lot of locks, so I know a thing or two about how they work. First, let's talk about how the pattern on the key is chosen. The pattern on the key is chosen so that the key is easy to use and hard to make a copy of. The pattern is made up of a bunch of little grooves that are arranged in a specific way. Each groove is called a ""tooth,"" and they are all the same shape and size. The grooves are arranged so that each tooth is aligned with the teeth on the lock. The teeth on the lock are called ""pins,"" and they are also all the same shape and size. When you turn the key, the teeth on the key push the pins up and down. The pins have to be pushed up and down in just the right way so that they fit into the grooves on the key. The teeth on the key are arranged so that they push the pins up and down in just the right way. When the teeth on the key push the pins up and down, the pins move into the grooves on the key.  ","In mass produced locks, there might be, say, five pins in the lock. A key will open that lock if each pin is at the right height when it rests on the key, and the key is turned. For each of the pins, a manufacturer will have a set number of lengths that they make. They are numbered 1 to 6 or 1 to 7 for common locks. These are called bitting numbers, with 1 being a short pin and a shallow cut in the key, and 6 or 7 being the longest pin they make and the deepest cut in the key. To make a lock, then, they pick a sequence of numbers like 34125, put pins of those lengths in the lock, and dial that number into a machine that cuts a key with the right depths in the right places. The convention is that the number is read left to right, and the first number (3 in the example) is closest to the part of the key you hold when using it. Now, they can't choose just any number. If you had 34**16**5 you might not be able to get the key in the lock because the slope between the 6 and the 1 is so steep. Nor could you have 3**61**25. The key would go in just fine, but it might never come out. So, how do they choose these so that keys don't open multiple locks? They don't. They just make enough that it's somewhat unlikely that the key to your house is~~n't~~ the same as your nextdoor neighbor's. It helps that there are different shapes to the keyways, that is, the wiggly shape of the hole the key goes into. A key might not even go in to a lock it wasn't made for. Here comes the bad news: it's cheaper to make identical locks and identical keys. Many manufactures do. Have you ever seen those little beige cash boxes with a black handle? The ones you've seen probably all have the same key. Electrical panels in a business with a little lock on them so that kids and bored customers don't fiddle with them? Same key as the cash boxes. Locks tend to be a really good psychological deterrent to the average Joe, but terrible at ~~supping~~ stopping someone who is reasonably determined to get past them. EDIT: double negative, oops. EDIT2: I have got to stop posting from my phone. Supping? Seriously, autocorrect? A lock is made up of pins. Each needs to be lifted a certain height to allow the lock to open. Now let's say that height is set to a digit so there are 10 unique possible heights. You multiply the number of pins by the possible heights to get the different possible combinations of locks that can be made. Which answers your last question: they aren't all different. The key to your front door will probably open some other door. But if there different enough, the chances of finding a matching door are slim to none. There are easier ways to get through a locked door than trying every potential key.

How is rocket fuel pumped into the combustion chamber of a rocket engine?,"The rocket fuel is pumped into the combustion chamber of a rocket engine through a series of pipes and valves. The pressure of the fuel when it is pumped into the engine is determined by the pressure of the fuel itself, which varies depending on the fuel being used.  ","Your assumption is correct, and the various ways that propellant is supplied under pressure to a liquid-fuelled rocket are referred to as the different ""cycles"". Probably the simplest one is a pressure-fed rocket. With this cycle you have the propellant tanks pressurized to a higher pressure than the combustion chamber, by filling the empty space in the tank with a gas like helium, that itself comes from an even higher pressure tank. This works fine for small or low pressure rockets, but with larger rockets or high pressures, the propellant tanks have to be so strong that they become impractically heavy. Then you have the ""expander"" cycle, which uses a pump to pressurize the propellants. If one of your propellants is something like hydrogen, that boils at a convenient temperature, you tap off some of the liquid propellant coming out of the pump, use it to cool parts of the engine that need cooling anyway, which boils the propellant. You now have a supply of warm, high-pressure gas that you can use to run the pump and then just dump into an exhaust pipe afterwards. If that doesn't give you enough pump power, you can move up to a ""gas generator"" cycle. With this cycle you tap off some fuel and some oxidizer from the pump and burn them in a separate combustion chamber. This gives you a supply of very hot gas with a lot more energy in it than the expander cycle, so you can use it to run a much higher pressure pump. The exhaust is again dumped overboard or through an exhaust manifold in the rocket nozzle. Then you have the really complicated ""staged combustion"" engines, which are like the gas generator cycle except the propellants are not burned completely and are injected into the main combustion chamber of the engine. These can also supply a lot of pump power and you don't lose as much performance, as the exhaust from the pump still goes through the whole engine and provides some thrust rather than being ""wasted"". In case you're wondering how much power it takes to run the propellant pump for a large rocket engine: the pump for the F-1 engine used on the Saturn V rocket's first stage uses the gas generator cycle and produces about 55,000 horsepower of pump power. There's a [turbo pump]( URL_0 ). That's a fuel pump which is driven by a turbine, which itself runs on rocket fuel and oxidizer. Another way to do it is to pressurize the fuel tanks using compressed gas, so that the fuel is pushed into the combustion chamber by pressure. This makes the fuel tanks quite heavy though.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 81.63, 'recall': 8.77, 'fmeasure': 15.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 35.42, 'recall': 3.74, 'fmeasure': 6.76}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 55.1, 'recall': 5.92, 'fmeasure': 10.69}}"
What part of a jet engines make them so loud?," In a jet engine, the loudest part is the fan, which is the spinning part that pushes air into the engine. It makes a lot of noise because it is spinning so fast and has a lot of mass. The fan is made of a special alloy of steel that is designed to be strong and lightweight. It also has a special shape that helps to reduce the noise. The other parts of the engine are also designed to be quiet, but they are not as loud as the fan. The engine also has a special exhaust system that helps to reduce the noise.   be very efficient so that the engine can produce a lot of power while still being quiet.

It also has a special shape that helps to reduce the noise. The engine also has a special exhaust system that helps to reduce the noise.  ","There are three places where significant sound is produced. The first is inside, anywhere you have blades. This is especially true of the compressor (first part of the engine) and the turbine (last part of the engine) where there are blades on the rotating part of the engine that go past stationary blades. Every time one blade goes past another you get a tiny pressure wave (i.e. sound). There are hundreds of blades and the rotating part is spinning incredibly fast, so this leads to a fairly loud, very high pitched sound. The ""whine"" of a jet engine is coming from here. The next is from the burning of fuel. In a car engine fuel is aggressively exploded at one point in the stroke, while in a jet engine the fuel is burned in a continuous process. This means that you don't get individual loud explosions to muffle, but it's still a source of white noise. The biggest source of noise, though, is when the very fast moving air comes out the back of the engine and has to mix with the slow moving air. Engines for commercial jets are designed to minimize the difference in air speeds. One way of doing this, which has the added benefit of making the engine more efficient, is to hook up an additional fan onto the same shaft as the compressor and turbine. This fan is used to create a stream of moderately fast air. The very fast air can mix with the moderately fast air, then that can mix with the slow air that didn't go through the engine at all. This more gradual mixing makes a commercial jet much quieter than an equally powerful engine on, for example, a fighter jet. This process of putting a big fan on the front of the engine makes a ""turbofan,"" which is what almost all jets are these days (contrast with a ""turbojet"" which has no fan). Passenger jets and cargo planes use a big fan, passing more air through the fan (and around the compressor and turbine) than goes through the core. This is because they prefer fuel efficiency and low noise. Fighter jets also use a fan, but they pass a higher percentage of the air through the core of the engine, since they prefer a higher power-to-weight ratio and a smaller size. Fighters also sometimes dump a bunch more fuel into the air after it's gone through (or around) the core. There's still plenty of oxygen left in this air, so this allows them to (inefficiently) create more thrust. This is an afterburner and it is incredibly loud since it increases the speed of the exhaust, reduces the amount of slow mixing that is allowed to occur, and it performs combustion right at the end of the engine where any noise generated is free to propagate outside of the aircraft. Anyone who's heard a fighter turn on their afterburners while at low altitude can attest that it is *incredibly* loud, which really shows just how much has gone into making passenger jets quieter than they could be.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 58.33, 'recall': 28.0, 'fmeasure': 37.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.95, 'recall': 5.73, 'fmeasure': 7.74}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 30.56, 'recall': 14.67, 'fmeasure': 19.82}}"

"Why electronics require such specific voltages as 3.3v, 5v or 12v?","It's because that is the voltage produced by the power source (battery) that it's designed to work with. Most electronics use the same voltage source, so they can be designed to work with that voltage source. In the case of the USB connector, it's designed to work with 5 volts. So, the USB connector is always 5 volts, and the computer (or whatever else is using it) is always 5 volts. The 5 volts is the ""nominal"" voltage, which is the voltage that the device is designed to work with. There's a lot of different voltage levels, but they all have a ""nominal"" voltage, and that's the voltage level that they are designed to work with.","Two different things: Common batteries come in a multitude of 1.5 volt because a single cell of a alkaline battery provides 1.5 volts when full. This voltage does not change if the battery becomes bigger or smaller, that only changes the duration it can provide this 1.5 volt. The other, 3.3v, 5v and 12 volt (and you are missing -12 volt) are standardized voltage levels in electronics (and thus computers) and then specially transistors and all inherited technologies like digital chips: Digital chips (IC's, integrated circuits) specially the TTL series have an ""low"" or 0 level at between 0.0 and 0.8 volts and a ""high"" or 1 level between 2 and 5 volts. So the maximum voltage you need there is 5 volts. Bingo, there is your 5. -12 and +12 volt are (where?) the voltages used for communications, but early logic used +12 because of noise / interference. You needed a huge difference between a 0 and a 1. With the TTL logic later on this wasn't needed so much anymore and you could go back to 5 volts. Now 3.3 volt: It's part of making chips faster without melting. If you double the number of transistors on the same area and double the frequency, you will need four times the power consumption. That's a lot of heat. If you decrease the voltage for that chip, you will reduce the power consumption and the metal lines on your chip won't melt. It is standardization, but not necessarily by any organization. The reasons for the specific numbers are rather hard to pin down, but it makes sense that engineers settled on a few voltages as the most common. Early transistors worked best in the range of 12V, and that was the same as car batteries. Lots of parts like light bulbs, motors or relays are made to work at specific voltages, so there was a lot of incentive to settle on a few voltages. You don't see 10V often because it is so close to 12V that most engineers would just design for 12V instead. For a long time 5V was the main standard for digital circuits. This was probably due to the introduction of 7400 series TTL (transistor-transistor logic) ICs in the early '60s. Later CMOS parts (which are still widely used) were made to be compatible. The 3.3 and lower voltages are now often used because high speed circuits can switch faster with lower voltages.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 64.46, 'recall': 18.53, 'fmeasure': 28.78}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.5, 'recall': 5.0, 'fmeasure': 7.78}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.06, 'recall': 9.5, 'fmeasure': 14.76}}"
how would you connect to the internet if a government severed all connections similar to what happened in Egypt during the Arab spring,"You can use a satellite connection. You would have to have a satellite dish and a modem. The signal would be transmitted to the satellite, then back to earth and then to your computer. It's expensive, but it works. There are also some other ways to do it, but I'm not sure how they work.","Presuming we're part of the secret resistance trapped in a tyrannical dictatorship, I'd recommend the following: 1. Satellite phone. These are essentially cellphones that you can attach to portable antennas for direction communications with satellites. They're expensive compared to standard cellphones and your bandwidth will be limited. But they're portable and relatively easy to conceal. 2. Shortwave radio. This uses terrestrial radio signals that can stretch beyond the boundaries of any nation. It's not very portable, but it's relatively concealable: the antenna needs to be (somewhat) exposed but it's relatively low-profile. You can also communicate while sitting in your secret underground bunker (unlike a satellite phone). However, the nefarious secret police can also track your signal if they're so inclined. To get around this, you could mount the radio in a vehicle but you'd quickly run into serious signal processing issues as shortwave isn't the best medium for digital data signals in the first place. 3. Two-way satellite. The consumer satellite service you're thinking of actually uses ground stations (which have been seized by the government). What you need is the big (meters in diameter) satellite dishes used for direct communication with the satellites. These are *very* noticeable, since they're fixed emplacements that require line-of-sight to the sky. So the government probably has a good idea where to send their soldiers to shut down communications. However, the most likely path is simple human frailty: *someone* has access to those telecommunications links and that someone is susceptible to bribery/coercion. This is not unique to Egypt during the Arab spring. Almost all countries involved in the Arab spring tried to shut down the protests by cutting Internet services. And a lot of other countries are doing the same. Some are helped by American companies like Cisco to make firewalls to filter out traffic. If there is a filter in place then you might be able to circumvent it using TOR. The public relays is usually blocked but the TOR project is distributing information on hidden relays to affected areas. If Internet is completely cut off then there is a chance that the phone networks is still working in which case you can use old fashioned modems to call international lines and connect to the Internet. There is a number of modem centrals that is still operating free of charge to anyone who connect. Another option is to use satellite based Internet solutions. Satellites cover a larger area then a single country and can be used in neighboring countries with little problems. For example the satellites covering Italy is very popular in Libya. When it becomes very hard to connect to the Internet then people also set up hand to hand messaging services. We see these types of services in almost every country with a limit on Internet access. You can use a computer very effectively using thumb drives and removable hard drives to carry the communication although real time services is out of the question.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 73.68, 'recall': 8.24, 'fmeasure': 14.81}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.29, 'recall': 1.57, 'fmeasure': 2.83}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 36.84, 'recall': 4.12, 'fmeasure': 7.41}}"

Nowadays people who enclose themselves in the garage with a running car are more apt to turn up at the ER with brain damage (instead of the morgue) if discovered in time, and the timeline for death is greatly extended, so discovery is more likely. Plus the exhaust is likely to make them nauseous, so they abandon the attempt instead of falling asleep. I wonder if there is anything in the medical or engineering literature about this.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 14.2, 'recall': 17.91, 'fmeasure': 15.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.79, 'recall': 2.26, 'fmeasure': 1.99}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 9.47, 'recall': 11.94, 'fmeasure': 10.56}}"
What is the difference between a Straight and Flat V8?," In terms of the general layout of the engine, the difference between a straight and flat V8 is the orientation of the cylinders. In a straight V8, the cylinders are aligned vertically and the crankshaft is oriented horizontally. In a flat V8, the cylinders are aligned horizontally and the crankshaft is oriented vertically. This means that the straight V8 has a higher compression ratio, which can result in better fuel efficiency.

They use sub-orbital trajectories to reach their targets, meaning that they begin by going mostly up, and then perform most of their flight outside of the atmosphere. When they come down they travel at almost orbital speeds (close to 8km/s) making them close to impossible to intercept on their descent. [edit] formatting. Long range missiles travel very very fast and come in pretty much from orbit. They are traveling about 7km/s A medium range missile is about 4km/s A short range missile is about 2 km/s So you need to hit something going very fast and you don't have a lot of time to aim at it once it comes down from space. As others have pointed out the speeds and distances involved are very significant, but there is a bit of a deeper question about why those numbers are so significant. Imagine we are defending against a short range missile fired from an airplane. The missile is armed with a conventional explosive warhead and needs to get within a few yards of its target to do its job. Because of that it needs a guidance package that is intelligently guiding it in. This gives it a lot of accuracy but it opens it up to being spoofed. Heat flares, chaff, concentrated energy bursts, can all be used to confuse or blind this system and if you pull that off the missile is toast. You can also try to shoot these things down. The CIWS system looks like R2D2 sporting a big erection. Basically you tie a very, very, big gun that fires an insanely high number of bullets (75 bullets every second) with a radar system and just spray bullets in the direction of the incoming missile. You might miss 1,000 times before you get a hit, but the fucking gun fires so fast it doesn't matter. However intermediate range missiles started becoming more of a thing. The problem with these things is that because they go MUCH faster than short range missiles, and because they are MUCH bigger even if you do shoot them and they disintegrate in the air, if they get anywhere near the target they are aiming for when this happens there momentum will carry them into the target and they will still do murderous damage. So you need to destroy them further out. That means you need a missile that is going to fly out 10, 20, 30 km from your ship or base and intercept them. This sounds hard, and it fucking well is. But you have three HUGE advantages. First if you try to shoot them down from the target, or from something relatively close to the path of the target (i.e. they are aimed at an aircraft carrier and one of its support shits is the anti-missile ship). all you have to do is get your interceptor to fly straight towards the incoming missile and then... explode early. If your intercentor is just a huge bomb filled with ball bearings or other fragmentation and it explodes a half second away from the missile to be intercepted you will have this nice big clowd of debris traveling very quickly towards the missile to be intercepted, while it travels very quickly towards this debris. The speeds actually help you. Keep in mind though, its still fucking hard to do this and impressive as hell that it can ever be done. For an ICBM your interceptor isn't at the target, it isn't even on the same trajectory. There is no cheating and you need a body to body contact for your kill for a lot of reasons. So its a quantum leap up in terms of difficulty.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 32.22, 'recall': 4.53, 'fmeasure': 7.95}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.49, 'recall': 0.63, 'fmeasure': 1.1}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.78, 'recall': 3.91, 'fmeasure': 6.85}}"
What happens if everyone in a city flushes their toilets at the same time?," tl;dr: Water pressure in the pipes increases, which can lead to burst pipes, water damage, etc. A lot of things happen. The water system is designed to handle a certain amount of water flow, and if the flow exceeds that amount, the system can be overwhelmed. Here's a good video on the topic: URL_0 Water flow is the amount of water that passes through a pipe in a given amount of time. If you want to know how much water is flowing through a pipe, you need to know the cross-sectional area of the pipe and the velocity of the water flow. The velocity of the water flow is the speed at which the water is flowing through the pipe. To measure the velocity of water flow, you need to know the volume of water flowing through the pipe. The volume of water flowing through a pipe is calculated by multiplying the cross-sectional area of the pipe by the velocity of the water flow. If you know the volume of water flowing through the pipe, you can calculate the flow rate of the water.   rate of water is the volume of water flowing through the pipe per unit time. For example, if you know the cross-sectional area of the pipe is 1 square meter, and the velocity of the water flow is 1 meter per second, you can calculate the flow rate of water as 1 meter per second.

In older buildings they do have a structural function. In these cases a brick wall isn't just one layer of bricks but several layers stacked and interlocked together. You can identify these because every few bricks in height you will see a row of ""thin"" bricks. These are bricks layed inward so that the outer layer will interlock with the next layer of bricks. The total height they can support is based partly on the thickness of the wall (something like a height of no more then 20 times the walls width at the base), though it's fairly rare to see a building of this type taller then 10 stories as it becomes increasingly more complicated to make a brick building taller without another supporting structure. We stopped making buildings out of brick or mostly brick a long time ago so I doubt they'd be structural in anything remotely modern, but they can absolutely be structural and there are plenty of buildings made entirely of brick.

What are the major roadblocks to 'industrializing' spider silk?,"First, it's not really a product that you can just go out and buy. It's a byproduct of spiders spinning their webs. Spider silk is made up of two proteins, dragline silk and capture spiral silk. The dragline silk is the silk that spiders use to build their webs. It's made up of 30-40% protein and 60-70% water. The capture spiral silk is used to capture prey, but it's also used to repair webs. It's made up of 40-50% protein and 50-60% water.   very strong. It's 5 times stronger than steel, and it's 15 times stronger than Kevlar. However, it's also very light. It's 1/5th the weight of steel, and it's 1/3rd the weight of Kevlar.   very elastic. It's able to stretch 50% of its length without breaking. This makes it very useful for things like bulletproof vests.   very biocompatible. It's used in a lot of medical applications, like wound dressings, and it's also used in implants.  ","Unfortunately, spiders themselves cannot be used to create any decent amount of thread. For one thing, they are cannibalistic and like to eat each other when placed in close quarters. Also, the orb weaving spiders (the ones that create the strongest type of fiber) can create 7 different types of silk and only really one of them is useful as far as strength properties go, so you have to literally [incapacitate a spider and manually draw the silk]( URL_6 ) to get the correct fiber from them. And, even if you do that, you would need [over a million spiders]( URL_5 ) to create anything useful as around 30,000 of them are needed to create a single gram of spider silk. Not really scalable. Now, that being said, artificial and transgenic spider silks are being created and industrialized as we speak. There are many companies and universities that are developing it and are on the cusp of commercialization using various vectors to achieve spider silk production via genetic editing of various organisms. These vectors can produce 2 things directly: spider silk protein powder and spider silk threads. Each has advantages and disadvantages. The spider silk protein powder is created by genetically altered bacteria, yeast, and goats that produce the proteins in their milk. The goats are inefficient, producing only about 2 grams of protein powder per liter of milk. Also, the goats take a long time to breed, so expanding production with this method is very slow going. The bacteria is more efficient, but the preferred bacteria, E.coli, can't store very long gene sequences, so need to be truncated to produce slightly inferior proteins and need to grow in a vat to make enough protein to be usable. The yeast method is the best protein method as it uses yeasts like *Pichia pastoris* that are able to store and transfer longer gene segments efficiently and accurately. The yeast also will reproduce much more efficiently with much cheaper “fuel” (mainly sugar water) to create much higher quality proteins than the bacteria method. Both the bacteria and yeast method have a very short gestation time, so any gene “tweaks” can be done to vary the properties of the proteins for custom applications. After they get the protein powder, they can then mix it with other substances to change their properties, turn it into a foam or film, or spin it into a fiber. Unfortunately, the mechanical spinning techniques such as wet spinning and electrospinning are still lacking and cannot spin fibers strong enough to measure up to natural dragline spider silks, but they are still being developed and I think it is only a matter of time before this issue is overcame. The spider silk fibers can be directly created by genetically altering silkworms. These silkworms get various strains of spider DNA injected into them and they can naturally spin different types of fibers. This method allows them to create much stronger fibers than the protein method, but it takes a longer gestation time and a lot of mulberry and space to expand production. Also, since you are directly producing the fibers with this method, it would be more costly if you wanted to create foams or films that can be made with the protein method. Now for the major companies creating the silks: **[Bolt Threads]( URL_7 )** is a San Francisco based company using transgenic yeast to create proteins that they spin into fibers for textiles. They have already released a limited production of [spider silk ties]( URL_13 ) and are working with Patagonia to create more textiles from their silks down the road. **[Spiber]( URL_10 )** Is a Japan based company that uses bacteria to make their protein powder that they plan to use in [automobiles]( URL_2 ) and spin into textiles. They are working with Goldwin, the main producer for The North Face Japan, to create jacked called the [Moon Parka]( URL_4 ) that should hopefully be out this winter. **[Kraig Biocraft Laboratories]( URL_11 )** is a Michigan based company that uses transgenic silkworms to create spider silk threads directly. They are currently fulfilling a [contract with the army to create bulletproof material]( URL_9 ) at small scale and are hoping to open a [large scale sericulture facility in Vietnam]( URL_1 ) in the near future to start mass production of their fibers for use in textiles. **[AMSilk]( URL_8 )** is a German based company that uses transgenic E.coli to produce protein that currently is being used in [cosmetics]( URL_3 ) and can be used in [medical applications]( URL_12 ). They are also working with Adidas to produce a [spider silk sneaker]( URL_0 ) that should be out in the near future.

"how can TOR, or other proxy tools, provide anonymity, when all the traffic, howsoever directed, goes from our computer to the internet via the ISP?","> Why do we need anonymity, if we are only communicating with our ISP?

You don't need anonymity when communicating with your ISP. Anonymity is important when you're communicating with other people, especially if you're talking about sensitive or illegal things. Your ISP knows where you are, and they know what you're doing, but they don't care. Your ISP is just a business, and they want to make money. They're not going to care about your privacy, or your anonymity. Your ISP doesn't care if you're talking to your friends, or if you're talking to your enemies. They don't care if you're talking about something illegal, or if you're talking about something legal. Your ISP just wants to make money, and they don't care about anything else. So, if you want to be able to communicate with other people without them knowing who you are, or without them being able to track you, then you need to use a proxy server. A proxy server is a computer that acts like a middleman, and it makes it impossible for your ISP to know what you're doing. It's like a shield that protects you from your ISP.  ","Lets say that Adam wants to send a letter to Zack. The only way to do this is to give it to Larry to deliver. The problem is that he doesn't trust Larry not to read the letter, so what does he do? Well, he establishes a code between himself and Zack, encodes the letter and sends it. Now Larry can deliver the letter but can't read it. That is the basis of encryption. The problem there is that while Larry can't read the letter, he still knows the letter is being mailed to Zach. We can fix this by sending the letter to Carol first. We set up a new code with Carol and send her a letter that says (in code), ""Send this letter to Zach"". Now Larry can deliver the letter without knowing the contents _and_ without knowing the recipient. Now, what happens if we don't fully trust Carol either? Well, we can get _another_ person involved - Dan. We set up the same system - we send a coded letter to Carol that says, ""Send this letter to Dan"". Dan gets the letter, decodes it and reads, ""Send this letter to Zach."" Now _no one_ in the entire chain knows the full story; Larry knows the sender, Dan knows the recipient, and Carol only knows the intermediaries. In this example, you are Adam, the website you want to go to is Zach, Larry is your ISP and Carol/Dan are Tor nodes. Your ISP knows you are connecting to a Tor node but has no idea what data you are sending nor who you are sending it to. Each of the intermediary Tor nodes knows the previous node, but not the origin or destination. The final node knows the destination, but nothing before the node that send the request. Since no individual node knows all the information, you are protected from any individual finding out the whole story - the only way for any given person to learn who the sender and recipient were is to get _every_ node to agree to give up the data and put the pieces together - something that is near impossible to do given the number of Tor nodes out there and their commitment to privacy. Your traffic is encrypted on your device, goes to the proxy server, is unencrypted, the server makes the request, the inwards traffic is then encrypted again and decrypted when it gets back to your device.

If you're unlucky, the pipe is made of clay, which can crack and break easily. If you're really unlucky, the pipe is made of cast iron, which is very brittle. If the pipe breaks, it can cause a backup in the toilet, which can cause the toilet to overflow. If you're lucky, the pipe is big enough to handle the amount of water that comes out of the toilet.   will overflow. If you're really unlucky, the pipe is too small, and the water will overflow into your basement or crawl space. The pipe is usually made of clay or PVC, and it's usually made of a certain size. If you're lucky, the pipe is big enough to handle the amount of water that comes out of the toilet.  ",Old buildings and old sewage systems is the primary cause. You also will sometimes have cases where someone did not do something up to code. Government regulations limited the amount of water that toilets could use. Until manufacturers figured out how to make them work well with less water this was such a problem you had people from border cities like Detroit going to Canada to get toilets that could flush a load down with a single flush without clogging.,"{'rouge1': {'precision': 12.71, 'recall': 28.75, 'fmeasure': 17.62}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.22, 'recall': 5.06, 'fmeasure': 3.09}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 9.39, 'recall': 21.25, 'fmeasure': 13.03}}"
"How are police lights and other flashing lights made, so that they do not trigger seizures in epileptic people?","When you sleep your body gets a lot more relaxed, so your muscles don't feel as heavy.

most ships have electricity onboard. Do they have grounding cables? Where does the electricity go?,"The electricity is used for powering motors, lighting, and other equipment on the ship. It is not used for propulsion. Ships do not have grounding cables. They have a grounding system that is connected to the hull. This is a system of wires that is connected to the hull and the propeller shaft. The wires are insulated with a special coating that is not conductive. If there is a fault in the wiring, the coating will prevent the electricity from flowing through the wiring.","The concept of ground on a ship (or generically, marine use) is somewhat more complex than on land. First, the concept of *ground* is simply a common reference for zero volts. In the simple sense, it does not matter how this is established. In practice, especially on a marine vessel there are several things to consider. First, most large ships have both AC and DC circuits. All the DC circuits should have pos/neg directly connected, and never use a ground shared by AC. With AC, you will have a ground bus (a large wire) that all the AC gear must be bonded (connected) to. Again, the idea is to get everything to a common zero-volt reference. No need to actually get them to a real ""ground"" like on land. There is also a ""lightning plate"" that is used on some ships to connect tall masts too..this plate is mounted under the boat...in the water. In some cases (esp. military) there are a lot of radios and RF gear on board, so those will be grounded in a separate circuit on their own. This keeps things like engine and lighting noise out of the radio. Such boats either have a generator or batteries (for smaller ones). In either case it all works in a closed loop contained within the ship. There are no grounding cables much the same way there aren't any in cars or airplanes that have power outlets on board.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 59.52, 'recall': 20.33, 'fmeasure': 30.3}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 10.84, 'recall': 3.67, 'fmeasure': 5.49}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.14, 'recall': 10.98, 'fmeasure': 16.36}}"
Why are most American college dormitories built with cinderblock interior walls?,It's actually the opposite in the US. Most homes are built with wood exterior walls and concrete interior walls. The reason is that wood is a lot cheaper and easier to work with than concrete. Concrete is also a lot more durable and requires less maintenance than wood. But it's also a lot heavier and harder to work with than wood.,"Because the school wants to spend as little money possible building and maintaining the premises. Doing so helps guarantee profit from offering living quarters in the first place.

"Ugly power lines, poles, transformer cylinders and other mess of stuff cloud my neighborhood. But my well-off parents' neighborhood has not a single wire in site. How?","Why? I'm not sure how much you know about power lines, but I'll try to explain it. Power lines are a bit like the blood vessels of a city. They're the arteries that carry the electricity to the houses and businesses. The power lines are actually made up of many wires, each one carrying a different voltage. The voltage of the power lines is what determines how far they can carry the electricity. The higher the voltage, the further the electricity can travel. In order to keep the electricity flowing safely, the power lines are insulated with plastic or rubber. This helps prevent the electricity from leaking out into the ground or the air. Power lines are usually placed in underground vaults, which are essentially big concrete boxes that house the power lines. These vaults are usually placed underneath the road, so the power lines are elevated above the road. This helps prevent cars from hitting the power lines and also helps prevent people from walking or driving over the power lines. In order to keep the power lines from sagging and touching the ground, they are supported by tall metal poles. These poles are usually made of steel and are covered in a protective coating to prevent rust. Power lines are usually placed on the left side of the road, so they don't interfere with traffic.  ","All those things can be run underground, but it can cost up to 10 times more than overhead systems. This cost means that they tend to only be put underground in regions where people are willing to pay that price, ie wealthy neighborhoods. The power is ran underground which is quite a bit more expensive to do. Each house will have some sort of power box near it housing the concealed transformer connecting it to the underground grid. Lots of comments about the price which is true. One other factor I want to mention is age. Is your neighborhood older than your parents' neighborhood? Many older communities are serviced by overhead electrical utilities. Buried powerlines and padmount transformers all the way to the end-user are a relatively 'new' thing. You may be asking why they don't convert, and the answer to that question is difficulty and cost (which share a lot in common). Negotiating all the other buried utilities such as natural gas, sewer, water, etc can be very time consuming and expensive. It is generally not a very good return on investment for established neighborhoods.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 25.11, 'recall': 30.85, 'fmeasure': 27.68}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.61, 'recall': 3.21, 'fmeasure': 2.88}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 11.26, 'recall': 13.83, 'fmeasure': 12.41}}"
How our major cities would get electricity without using coal to boil the water at nearly every electricity plant?,"We would use gas, or nuclear power plants. There are also some hydroelectric plants that use water from rivers to generate electricity. Coal is used to generate electricity because it is a cheap and reliable source of energy. However, it is also very dirty and pollutes the environment, so many countries are looking to switch to cleaner sources of energy. There are many ways to generate electricity, including: * Nuclear power: this uses nuclear reactions to produce heat, which is then used to boil water to produce steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity. * Hydroelectric power: this uses water from rivers or oceans to drive a turbine to generate electricity. * Geothermal power: this uses hot water from under the earth's surface to produce steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity. * Solar power: this uses sunlight to produce steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity. * Wind power: this uses wind to drive a turbine to generate electricity. * Biomass power: this uses organic material (such as wood chips) to produce steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity. * Gas power: this uses natural gas (a fossil fuel) to produce steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity.  ","I don't think he's correct. According to [this]( URL_2 ), globally only 40% of our power is coal. [In the united states, stats are similar]( URL_1 ). As much as I don't want to rag on the guy, his future as a coal miner is not looking great. Coal usage is going down, and next up in line for stuff we can burn is oil and natural gas. The mining process for these is different (definitely doesn't require the big worker crews, much more pipelines and engineers). Wikipedia [also has a nice chart]( URL_0 ) near the bottom of the page on what renewables we're using for our power needs. Hydroelectric USED to be an enormous portion of it, but that has other problems (like there's only so many rivers we can dam) that prevent it from growing. Onshore wind has been the US's largest growth for power production, and while it's only recently become viable, rooftop solar setups are a tiny chunk but growing. Well, you could show them [this page]( URL_0 ) which has an unsourced, undated claim from the fucking WORLD COAL ASSOCIATION that says that coal only provides about 41% of global electricity. Seems like if anyone was going to exaggerate the amount, it'd be them, and even they only put it at not quite half. Coal definitely is and has been important to generating electricity, and I wouldn't be shocked that it is and will be the plurality electricity source for a while since it's so good at it and so cheap. But it's nothing close to 95%. Coal is still a major global source of electricity, but it's not anywhere near 95% of the power generated: URL_1 I suppose he's right if you live in Mongolia. China is around 80% on that chart, and the United States is around 40%. However, that chart is only from 2011, and things have changed a lot since then. As of 2016, the US is down to 30% electricity production from coal. URL_0 I don't know the exact numbers, but 95% coal worldwide sounds really unlikely. Natural gas, petroleum, biomass, burning waste, solar towers, solar photovoltaic nuclear fission, wind power, hydroelectric, wave power, and geothermal are all ways to generate electricity without coal. Many of the above use similar technology as coal but have a different source of heat to boil the water. Others find different ways to move the water over the turbines. Others still turn the turbines without boiling water. And others still produce electricity without turbines.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.44, 'recall': 20.09, 'fmeasure': 27.67}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.58, 'recall': 2.52, 'fmeasure': 3.47}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.71, 'recall': 9.36, 'fmeasure': 12.89}}"
Why do so many bathrooms have their light switches outside of the room?,"The light switch is usually placed outside the bathroom for a couple reasons. One reason is to prevent people from turning off the light when they are in the bathroom. This is especially important in public places like restaurants and stores. In these places, it is not uncommon for people to have accidents in the bathroom. Turning off the light would make it more difficult for the staff to see what is going on in the bathroom, and could make it more difficult to clean up spills. Another reason is to prevent people from accidentally turning off the light. In many bathrooms, the light is controlled by a switch that is placed on the wall near the door. This means that people can easily turn the light off when they enter the bathroom, and forget to turn it back on when they leave. This is especially true for people who are not familiar with the bathroom.

It's easier to fit the wires in there with loose tolerances for placement if they only go in one-way. However, due to improved manufacturing techniques, current generation plugs (USB-C, Lightning, etc.) ARE designed to go either way up. The older-generation plugs were even worse: they had a live-line pin using the old DIN connectors -- but different hardware used the same connector for different purposes, with a different pin being live. It *used* to be cost-prohibitive. Not so much anymore. The original USB was standardized in 1996, back when manufacturing techniques were not nearly as advanced as they are now. The desire to keep the standard strong and ubiquitous throughout the market is what kept the connector the same for years upon years. That was one of the biggest benefits, you could plug any USB standard into any USB port and it would work. As time went by, and as devices got smaller, the need for a new connector came about which is what prompted Mini-USB and Micro-USB. While this addressed the size concern, it was still limited by the manufacturing techniques. Now that ""we have the technology"" we are seeing more and more connectors moving towards the reversible connection standard. But it is a slow progress because so many devices out there only support the older standard that companies are hesitant to adopt the new standard. Complexity. For nearly all standards. Every single pin is defined for a single purpose. Even reversible connectors have pins labeled in a certain order. So when you plug in a non reversible cable into a non reversible socket. Pin 1 on plug always matched pin 1 on socket. Now imagine you have 6 pins. Three on top three on bottom. 1-3 on top 4-6 on bottom. Now sometimes you get pin 1 connecting to pin 4 so you need to be able to detect that inversion and then reroute the internals to accommodate. This increases cost and design complexity.

How are transistors (and others small computer parts) made if they are so small?," We have the technology to make things smaller, but it's not easy. It's very expensive, and it's very difficult to control. We've been making things smaller and smaller for a long time, and we're still doing it today. The first transistors were made by doping (changing the properties of) silicon. They were made by creating a tiny bubble in the silicon. The bubble was then filled with a gas, and a tiny electrode was used to move the gas in and out of the bubble. This was done by applying a voltage to the electrode, which caused the gas to move. The gas was then used to control the flow of electricity through the transistor. The first transistors were very large, and they were very expensive. In the 1950s, the first transistors were made using a process called doping. Doping involves adding tiny amounts of impurities to a material, which changes the properties of the material. The first transistors were made by adding tiny amounts of boron and phosphorus to silicon. This was done by heating the silicon in a vacuum chamber, and then adding the impurities using a tiny nozzle. The impurities were then left to settle on the surface of the silicon. The first transistors were very large, and they were very expensive.","You ever see an old movie or slideshow projector? Shine a light through a tiny picture then through a lens and it projects this massive image on the screen from a tiny picture. Turns out we can do that in reverse.

So the manufactures coat a tiny chip with the stuff, then make a big picture with the circuits they want, they then shine the special light through and break apart the stuff so it forms the circuit they want, just very tiny. This is called photolithography. I can't ELI on this but it's done by having UV light chemically react with the substrate and thus etching the transistors in a silicon layer. Since you're using light you can now use a lens to shrink this down to those tiny sizes.

Why hasn't the hydrogen engine taken over the combustible engine market?,"The hydrogen engine has been around for a while, and it's not really taking over the market for several reasons. First, it's really hard to get hydrogen. It's not something you can just get from the gas station down the street. It's hard to extract from water, it's hard to extract from coal or natural gas, and it's hard to extract from biomass. So, the cost of producing hydrogen is really high. The other thing is that hydrogen is not very efficient. It takes a lot of energy to convert hydrogen into electricity, and it takes a lot of energy to compress the hydrogen gas so it can be stored. This means that the efficiency of a hydrogen engine is much lower than a gasoline engine. Finally, there's a safety issue. Hydrogen is really flammable, and it's hard to store it safely. So, it's not something you can just put in your car and drive around. So, it's not really practical, and it's not really cost-effective. So, it's not really taking over the market.","Hrm... okay, so lots of problems here. 1. Hydrogen engines do not run on water. They burn (oxidize) hydrogen in order to produce energy. Although the hydrogen can be extracted from water via electrolysis, most hydrogen is manufactured by breaking apart methane from natural gas. Even if the hydrogen burned came purely from electrolysis, you still need to provide energy to the electrolysis reaction in order to make that hydrogen. Said energy would come from power plants, coal, gas, nuclear, solar, whatever. 2. hydrogen is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is also invisible, undetectable to any human sense, and highly explosive. These all make it less than ideal for a fuel source. hydrogen needs to be liquified or highly compressed in order to have the energy density to drive a car more than a few miles. Now consider what would happen if two such cars were to collide. A canister of pressurized and highly explosive fluid is not what you want to have in your car in such a situation. The extra material that would be required to contain and protect the hydrogen would make a car much heavier than the plastic/sheet metal gas tanks in standard automobiles. And heavier = less efficient. 3. Those issues aside, hydrogen makes an appealing fuel because of its high efficiency. The combustion reaction of hydrogen and oxygen produces a lot of energy without requiring much to sustain itself. And since it doesn't produce CO2, it's appealing as a ""green"" technology (though it does produce NO2 and I think NO3 due to the nitrogen in the air, and those are both greenhouse gasses as well). The problem then comes down to efficiency. As I said, most commercial hydrogen is made from natural gas, because the amount of energy required to break down that gas compared to the energy that the released hydrogen produces is rather good (I recall reading somewhere that it's about 80-90% efficient? Don't have a source for that though). Generating hydrogen through electrolysis is much less efficient, somewhere in the 10-20% range. Using natural gas doesn't really help the environment. The carbon output shifts to the hydrogen processing facility, and you're spending more energy than just burning the natural gas in the car itself. Using electrolyzed hydrogen helps the environment only so long as the source of your electricity is much, much cleaner than the car (because you're spending so much more energy to liberate that hydrogen), but it's a massive spike in demand to the electrical grid. It's possible that hydrogen could replace gasoline in automobiles, but for now the cons outweigh the pros. Not to mention there's the logistical nightmare of installing new facilities in every gas station in the world to store and distribute hydrogen. Electric cars perform many similar functions, but have many fewer drawbacks, which is why they've been pursued more vehemently. > He explained that it's a combustible engine that basically runs on water Oh boy, it's this scam again. You can't run an engine on water, and the fact that it hasn't taken over the market should be the first clue. So in theory, you pass an electric current through water to break it into hydrogen and oxygen, burn those gases and get energy back. But functionally, you will **always** get back less energy then you put in to split the water in the first place. It's a thermodynamic certainty that you'll always be running at a loss. Now, hydrogen isn't a terrible fuel for combustion in and of itself, but pure hydrogen is exceedingly rare entirely *because* it's so good for combustion; it reacts very easily. Thus, you have to provide energy to split the water up and regain that hydrogen. Worse, burning hydrogen in an air-breathing engine isn't actually emission-free, because air contains nitrogen gas. At high temperatures (which hydrogen is very good at producing when combusted), oxygen and nitrogen react to for oxides of nitrogen (collectively, NOx), which are the emissions that VW recently got in trouble over. Hydrogen engines don't run on water, they run on hydrogen gas. Hydrogen can be sourced from water, but it's extremely energy intensive to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is also difficult and dangerous to store in significant quantities (see: the Hindenburg disaster)","{'rouge1': {'precision': 71.66, 'recall': 18.11, 'fmeasure': 28.91}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 21.51, 'recall': 5.41, 'fmeasure': 8.65}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 35.29, 'recall': 8.92, 'fmeasure': 14.24}}"
Why are subway costs so high in the U.S. compared to the many other nations that have subway systems?,"The cost of building and maintaining subway systems is very high.

You can later bring the project back but you need extra money to get things going again. 3. Several layers of government make it hard to figure out who is actually responsible for what. Also the state might have all their money together but needs to wait on the federal government and vice-versa. 4. Bad project planning possibly from an overall lack of expertise when it comes to managing a subway project (fewer subways overall, fewer opportunities to learn what works and what doesn't in building one). 5.

Why do different explosive materials make different sounds when they explode?,"- I have no idea, but I can tell you that it has to do with the speed of the explosion. Faster explosions are louder. It's the same reason that high speed trains are louder than low speed trains. The same reason that a car engine sounds different when it's revving and when it's idling. The same reason that a gunshot sounds different when it's fired from a short barrel and from a long barrel. The speed of the explosion. If you want to hear it in a more scientific way, think about the speed of sound. The speed of sound is about 340 meters per second. That's 1115 km/h. That's fast. But not as fast as a bullet. A bullet can travel at 1200 km/h. That's 3500 m/s. That's a lot faster than the speed of sound. So if you fire a bullet, it will make a louder sound than a gunshot. The same is true of an explosion. If it goes off faster, it will be louder. If it goes off slower, it will be quieter. The speed of the explosion is the same as the speed of the sound. So if you want to make an explosion louder, you need to make it faster.

"Are power banks like batteries, in that they are made of multiple cells (like a 9V is really 6 x 1.5V) or no?","They are made of multiple cells. They are made of multiple cells, but not necessarily like a 9V battery, which is made of 6 cells of 1.5V each. Instead, they are usually made of multiple cells of 1V each, connected in parallel. This allows the battery to provide a higher voltage, but still have a higher current capacity. The battery can also be made of multiple cells of different voltage and capacity, connected in series. This allows the battery to provide a higher voltage, but also a higher capacity.","I'm not an electrical engineer (IANAEE) but nobody else has really answered your question so let me tell you what I know. (Or think I know) Different materials combined naturally make a specific current. For instance Alkaline batteries make 1.5 volts per cell. One AA battery is one cell. You can put two of these cells in series (end to end like in a mag flashlight) to make 3 volts. An alkaline 9 volt is 6 small cells in series. Etc. Other materials such as lithium ion batteries make 3.6 volts per cell. Put two cells together to make 7.2v, 3 in series to make 10.8, etc. Use a regulator on those three cells to restrict the voltage to 9 volts down from 10.8 and you have a nine volt battery. So to answer your question, yes, a 9 volt battery is generally more than one cell in series. But how many cells to reach your desired voltage depends on the materials of the battery. Oh, and mAh is the capacity. One AA alkaline battery and one AAA alkaline battery will both have the same volts but the AA is bigger so it has more mah and will last longer.

What's the reason for nuclear plant smoke stacks having a concave shape?, Slightly off topic but the concave shape of the smoke stack is also useful for the cooling effect. The concave shape allows the smoke to move in a spiral and it cools the smoke by the effect of the Bernoulli's principle. The smoke stack is not only useful for the smoke but also for the water vapor that comes out of the cooling system. The concave shape of the smoke stack allows the water vapor to move in a spiral and it cools the water vapor by the effect of the Bernoulli's principle.,"Airflow. The cool air is pulled from vents around the base and it rises after it is heated. The shape allows expansion at the top, perpetuating the draw at the bottom. They're not smoke stacks - nuclear plants don't produce any smoke. They're cooling towers. The shape of the towers creates a natural chimney effect that allows for a lot of cooling without needing fans. If you don't have the big cooling tower shape, then your towers need tons of fans to do the same cooling. These towers are to cool the water used in the condenser to turn the plant steam back into liquid. Only about 1/3rd of us nuclear plants use them. More fossil/coal plants use them than nuclear. The plant can either draw 600,000 gallons per minute from a lake or river to cool its condenser (and return much hotter water back to the lake/river), or they can build cooling towers that don't return any hot water to the lake/river and only require water to make up for evaporation in the towers.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 53.68, 'recall': 27.72, 'fmeasure': 36.56}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.32, 'recall': 2.73, 'fmeasure': 3.61}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.47, 'recall': 15.22, 'fmeasure': 20.07}}"
How does having the engine in the back of a car change how it drives?," Cars with engines in the front have the engine in front of the front wheels and cars with engines in the back have the engine behind the back wheels. Both types of cars have the engine connected to the transmission which transmits the power to the wheels. However, cars with engines in the back have the transmission connected to the wheels behind the engine and cars with engines in the front have the transmission connected to the wheels in front of the engine. This changes how the power is transmitted to the wheels and how the car handles. For example, cars with engines in the back tend to have more power and less torque. Torque is how much a car can pull in a straight line. Cars with engines in the front have more torque because the engine is closer to the wheels in front. This means that cars with engines in the front tend to be better at pulling in a straight line.

How close can a speakers sound same as the hearing the instrument naturally?,  short answer is that there is no way to make a speaker sound exactly the same as the instrument.   reason for this is that the speaker has a different frequency response than the instrument. This is because of the physical properties of the speaker and the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is the range of frequencies that the speaker can produce.   frequency response of the instrument is the range of frequencies that the instrument can produce.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the speaker.   frequency response of the instrument is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.   frequency response of the speaker is limited by the physical properties of the instrument.  ,"There are speakers that can be put behind a curtain, and an orchestra put next on them, and most people wouldn't hear the difference. These setups cost as much as houses. There are speakers so precise they overdo it, giving away that they are speakers. There are several ways to measure a speaker's quality but there's only one that matters: listening to it. Speakers are like glasses, they sound different for everyone so only you know what you'll like. Short answer: yes, but it's not cheap There isn't really a unit of measure for accuracy. The closest measure we have is THD or total harmonic distortion. The less harmonic distortion in an amplifier and speaker, the more natural the sound will appear. For instance high THD in bass frequencies sounds boomy or bloated like a loud car stereo. High THD in treble frequencies sounds like an old radio turned up too loud or a megaphone. There are different aspects of amplifier and speaker design that can affect realism including dynamic range, noise, distortion, and frequency response. To produce an accurate sound it needs to clearly record the original performance, amplify it, and play it back without taking anything away or adding anything that wasn't in the original. For instance noise would be adding something to it. A recording that didn't cover the full spectrum of human hearing would be taking something away. Amplifiers are of different classes such as A, AB, D, etc. Class A is the closest to perfect reproduction but is very inefficient and creates a lot of heat. AB is pretty close but much more efficient. The differences are in the way the amplifier circuit takes a low level audio wave form and makes it louder. Speakers will usually use crossover networks to send different frequencies in a recording to speakers optimized for those sounds such as bass to a woofer, mid range to a smaller speaker, and treble to a tweeter. How well built the crossover is will affect the clarity of the sound as well as the tonal balance of bass to mids, to treble. The quality of the speaker and how stiff it is, how powerful the magnet is, the size of the voice coil, and it's dynamic resistance to the amplifier signal all affect the quality of sound and how loudly the speaker can play back a signal without distortion. In general a speaker cone needs to be very stiff. There is a type of problem on moving surfaces like a speaker cone called modal breakup. If you imagine the speaker as a flat piece of paper, ideally it should move up and down without bending the paper. But at certain frequencies, the paper will bend in different shapes like ripples on a pond. These cause distortion and color the sound. Speakers tend to be designed so the frequency at which this modal breakup occurs, is higher in frequency than the speaker will be played back at. For instance a woofer with a modal breakup at 100hz is fine if the crossover only sends it audio that is below 80hz. The frequency at which this happens changes with the stiffness of the speaker, the material it's made with, and the support structure and speaker size. To fully explore your question would require a 200 page book but these are some of the things to consider. The pursuit of realistic audio is generally the elimination of distortion and noise at every path in the signal from the original recording, through the recording medium like CD or Vinyl, through it's amplification, and it's playback from a speaker or headphone. A flat frequency response where the bass, midrange, and treble are in balance with each other, and how loud or silent a speaker can play back is in the same range of loudness as the original instrument. For instance drum sounds that when played back are as loud as a real drum, vocals that when played back are as loud as a singer in your room, etc.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 47.88, 'recall': 18.16, 'fmeasure': 26.33}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.3, 'recall': 3.52, 'fmeasure': 5.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.36, 'recall': 13.03, 'fmeasure': 18.9}}"
"Why do some vehicles (certain busses, semi trucks, etc) have completely flat front ends? Isn't this the last aerodynamic shape possible without getting concave?", Lots of vehicles have flat front ends. The most common reason is to reduce drag. The flat front end has less drag than a curved one. The front end of a truck is not aerodynamic. The front end of a truck is designed to be strong. The front end of a truck is designed to carry heavy loads.   the front.   the side.   the rear.   the top.   the bottom.   the side.   the side.   the side.   the side.   the side.  ,"A lot of vehicles prioritize length and internal volume over aerodynamics. A bus operator for example wants to be able to fit the maximum number of people in his buses, while still staying under the total allowable length for a bus. There's a lot of different answers here. I can't exactly link this, but way back in grad school, I was part of a group working on the math part of a larger problem in fluid dynamics (air is a type of fluid), that was very roughly similar to a flat box moving through a compressible fluid. TL;DR: the air in front of the truck smooshes up and creates a relatively high(er) pressure zone that very loosely approximates an [albacore hull]( URL_0 ), which is pretty efficient in moving through air/water/fluid. To start - this wasn't my model/project or anything, but a few people in class with me helped out figuring out the math involved. Moving on - using the idea of a box moving through a compressible fluid as a frame our model spit out something like this (hugely simplified): imagine the flat cab of the truck moving at 50mph down the highway. The air immediately in front of the cab slows dramatically and compresses as it encounters the windshield/grill, before it turns ~90 degrees and scoots across the front of the windshield and off to the side of the truck. This creates a relatively higher pressure 'bubble' immediately in front of the truck. This little 'bubble' of air in front of the cab forces the air that comes next (as its driving down the road) to move off to the side and deflect at an angle, much more efficiently. If you were to picture it, imagine that flat-front cab having an invisible bubble/dome (made of higher pressure/compressed air) over the flat front which helps it move through the air easier. To be clear, its not the **most** efficient shape possible (that would be more conical), I'm saying that its far more efficient/aerodynamic than you might guess. Plus it has the visibility/volume benefits that other people are mentioning. There are some weird answers in here... Having a semi-flat front isn't the worst actually, you can look at a box fish for example. Second these vehicles aren't meant to move very fast, so drag doesn't play a big role...but what about transport trucks on the freeway going 70 mph? Well they're usually pulling something that's going to kill any aerodynamics, sure they could be made more aerodynamic, but the priority goes towards the engine compartment and design, and the flat front helps feed air into the engine for combustion and the radiator for cooling. It's mostly about maximizing usable space. For buses, an engine in the back takes up less space than in the front (because it can take up the entire vertical space) and you don't have to run the drive shaft as far to power the rear wheels. So for city buses this allows you to have low floors, which improves handicap accessibility (no stairs) and for long-distance buses it allows more cargo space underneath. Semi-trucks like this are more common in Europe because Europe has regulations governing the total length of trucks, so a shorter cab allows a longer trailer. Limits in the US are generally only based on the trailer length. Flat cabs or cab over engine busses also increase visibility in the front. When you have a long nose of the vehicle sticking out in front on nearly the same plane as the windshield there are lots of blind spots. People get on and off the bus and cross the street in front of the bus, thus creating a high likelihood of getting run over if they are in a blind spot. That's why slot of school busses have the arm that extends out the front so people walk out in front far enough to be visible. Very large vehicles have a lot of inertia, so air drag does not have as much of a practical effect at street speeds as it would on normal automobiles. City buses in particular spend so much time slowing down, stopping, and speeding up again that their average speed is low and thus air drag is not much of a factor. Only at much higher speeds - such as those achieved by a maglev train - would a very massive vehicle with a lot of inertia need to be designed aerodynamically. This is why the relatively slow trains in the US look like this: URL_0 While the Shinkansen bullet trains in Japan look like this: URL_1 Aerodynamic needs change with both mass and speed. Lower mass or higher speed = you have to take air drag more into account.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 74.36, 'recall': 7.13, 'fmeasure': 13.0}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 24.68, 'recall': 2.34, 'fmeasure': 4.27}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 47.44, 'recall': 4.55, 'fmeasure': 8.3}}"
"Why is ""jumping a car battery"" enough to make the battery work again indefinitely, if it was a dead battery?"," ""Jumping a car battery"" is a term that's been around for a while, but it's not an exact term. It doesn't really mean jumping the battery, it means jumping the electrical system. When you jump a car, you're basically connecting the two batteries together. This is fine when you're jumping two cars together, but if you're jumping a car that's dead, it's not good because it's not designed to be connected to another car. The problem is that the dead car's battery is not able to hold a charge, so when you connect the two batteries together, the dead car's battery will drain the other car's battery. It's also worth noting that the dead car's battery is not able to hold a charge, so if you want to drive the car, you'll need to replace the battery. There are a few things that can happen when you jump a car. It depends on the type of car, but here are a few things that can happen: 1. The car will start, but the battery will still be dead. 2. The car will start, but the battery will be weak and will probably need to be replaced. 3. The car will not start.  ","Your battery normally doesn't die because the alternator charges it. When a car isn't running, the engine obviously isn't either. to start the engine, the battery is used. once the engine starts the alternator charges the battery back up and you are ready for the next time you need to start your car. when someone jumps your car, they give you enough energy to start your engine but then your engine charges the battery back up to full! Car batteries are rechargeable. When you start your car the battery produces enough electricity for the spark plugs to start everything running then a part called the alternator sends electricity to the battery. If the battery is empty it can't make the spark plugs spark and the car won't start. A jump start provides enough power to get things going and then the alternator takes over. When the engine is running, it drives the alternator, which constantly charges the battery up. When the engine is turned off, the alternator is no longer turning, so the battery is not being charged. This is why you can drive forever with your lights, air-con/heater, radio, iPod, etc connected without draining the power in the battery. But if you leave these accessories on when you've turned the engine off, the battery begins to run flat. Most of the time, a flat battery is not really ""dead"", it's just temporarily drained (e.g. because you've left your lights on without the engine running). Jumping the battery provides enough power to turn the engine over, and once the engine is running, the alternator will charge the battery back up again. This is why you're supposed to leave the engine running for a period of time after jumping a battery.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 47.0, 'recall': 33.77, 'fmeasure': 39.31}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.57, 'recall': 8.31, 'fmeasure': 9.67}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.04, 'recall': 16.56, 'fmeasure': 19.27}}"
How do water towers work? How has technology not progressed to make them obsolete?,"Water towers are a cheap way to pump water to the top of a building. They are not obsolete because they are a very cheap way to pump water to the top of a building. Pumping water up to the top of a building is a lot more expensive than just having a tank full of water on the roof. Water towers are often used in places where there is a lot of land available, and where there is not a lot of pressure in the water supply. They are also often used in places where there is a lot of water in the air, which can be used to cool the water down. They are also often used in places where there is not a lot of water in the ground, which can be used to fill up the tank. The water towers are made of steel or concrete.   built on a foundation of concrete and steel.

","It's almost the perfect system. You are only dependant on gravity to make it work. No electricity no problem. Gravity has your back. If you have an extended power outage you only have to get external power to the pump at the tower to make sure everyone has water. As bad as hurricanes, snowstorms, etc are if would be an order of magnitude worse if you did not have clean water. Basically let physics do its thing. If the Fukushima nuclear plant had used gravity instead of electricity as an emergency cooling backup then no one would probably know what Fukushima was. A kids TV program here in the UK was going to film a water tower being demolished . They filmed all of the setup stage where the long-derelict tower just outside town was refilled with water then had a big drum of explosives lowered into it Those things are reinforced concrete and it takes a huge bang to blow it apart, so having the water in there spreads the pressure evenly to avoid shrapnel taking out everything for miles around. By the time it was all done the light had faded so they left it to blow it up in the morning. When they came back the tower was gone. Some time in the night the weight of water had been too much for it and it had collapsed completely. Nobody lived close enough to hear it go. Some poor sod had to dig through tons of collapsed concrete to extract the big drum of explosives too. It's not so much that the towers supply water pressure as that they keep it the same all the time, and also ensure adequate supply around the clock. A residential suburb might see a quarter of all water consumption between 7 and 8 am, when everyone is showering and flushing at the same time. For small suburbs using water from wells, storing a sufficient supply means they don’t need big pumps to handle peak demand all at once. Big cities have much less of a supply problem, and demand is balanced by industrial users and spread out through the day. In addition, modern pumping systems can regulate pressure pretty well for a large number of users, without needing a gravity standpipe. Water towers are used to establish the water pressure of your town's system. If you lived in a hilly area, then a big water tank towards the top of one of those hills would serve the same purpose. The tower establishes the pressure in the system by gravity - which is why they're tall. As an added bonus, if the power goes out you've still got a supply of water for at lest some time. URL_0 Technology ? It is such an effective and simple system... Water towers are like capacitors in electronics. They store energy and can smooth fluctuations in supply and demand.

They record the transaction and when the drop box is transferred to a bank later on the bank employees manually count and verify the amount of money was correct.

However, when the deposit is audited & verified later and there's only a $20 bill in there versus $2000, you're going to be in deep shit for fraud. Most cash-accepting ATMs these days don't do envelope deposits anymore. Cash is fed into the machine where it can electronically count it and deposit it accordingly. Checks are scanned and handled electronically, but the the ATM may still ask you to input or verify the amount of the check. This is another case of ""if you like to the ATM, you're on the hook for fraud"". Sure, if you accidentally enter $470 instead of $450, I doubt the bank will go after you (they'll just eventually debit the extra $20).

why do pens dry out if you leave the cap off even though most caps have holes in the top?,"Its a combination of two things: 1. Air enters the pen, and it dries out the ink. 2. The ink sits in the pen and gets evaporated by the air in the room. The cap has a small hole in the top to allow air to enter, but it is small enough that it doesn't allow enough air to enter to keep the ink from drying out. This is especially true if you have a pen that has a cap with a small hole in it, like a fountain pen with a metal cap. When you put the cap on, the air that enters the pen is able to evaporate the ink. If you put the cap on and then leave it off, the ink will dry out. If you put the cap on and then leave it off for a while, the ink will dry out. If you put the cap on and then leave it off for a long time, the ink will dry out. The more time you leave the cap off, the more the ink will dry out. If you leave the cap off for a long time, you will need to use a pen cleaner to get the ink out of the pen. This is because the ink is so dried out that it will not come out of the pen. It is like trying to get water out of a sponge that has been sitting in the sun for a long time.","**TL;DR:** Air, humidity, and heat circulation levels. Air has two ways of drying out stuff. The first is through simple ""Brownian Motion"" - the effect where absolutely still air has individual particles (molecules) that move around and when they hit some water, knock some loose and evaporate them. This doesn't work very well at all when the air is already humid (filled with water). The second is through general motion, like if a breeze or wind is blowing and pushing ALL SORTS of molecules past, say, a pen's nib. This really affects stuff if the air is warm, and it really steals a lot of water or light oils from something like inks, soaps, or gels, particularly if the air isn't already packed with moisture. Putting a pen's nib in a cap with tiny airholes pretty much stops all breezes and causes the small bit of space around the pen's point to stay full of water already... so more of the pen's ink won't dry up and crust everything all up when you try and write with the pen the next time. There's just not enough air circulation to really dry the pen out. The other thing to note is that many pen caps—particularly for felt-tip pens that *are* at risk of drying out, because of the type of ink they contain—have two sections, one inside the other. The inner section is usually fairly small, and is designed to form an air-tight seal around the tip of the pen to stop it from drying out. The outer section is much larger, so it's easier to grip. Holes are usually moulded through this larger section, so that if the pen cap gets caught in a child's windpipe, air can still pass through it, supposedly reducing choking risk. These holes go around the inner section, so they don't affect the ability of the inner section to seal the pen.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.99, 'recall': 35.24, 'fmeasure': 40.28}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.47, 'recall': 6.34, 'fmeasure': 7.25}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.69, 'recall': 16.27, 'fmeasure': 18.59}}"

If it's your finger you get shocked. If it's metal there could be a spark. If there's a spark there could be a fire. Building codes are designed to prevent things like accidental fires. By installing the outlet ""upside-down"", you put the ground prong on top of any plug that has one. The ground prong can't create a spark all by itself, so it's safer to touch accidentally. I don't think they have to be that way, but it's not required by or against code. I have seen it done in a way that was handy, where electricians flip them if they're tied to a wall switch. It becomes an easy visual cue that the outlet is associated with a switch rather than live all the time. As far as my experience with outlets. It's not really union practice or code.

Why can't diesel electric trains go faster much faster than 130 mph?," Different types of electric motors are used for different applications.   induction motors are used for high speed applications like trains and aircraft because they are more efficient and compact. DC motors are used for low speed applications like conveyor belts and cranes because they are more rugged and reliable.   induction motors are not as rugged as DC motors, so they are not used for high speed applications.   induction motors are used in trains because they are more efficient than DC motors. DC motors require a lot of power to accelerate a train, so they are not as efficient as   induction motors.   induction motors are more efficient because they use a magnetic field to accelerate the train. DC motors use a physical connection to the train, which means they have to accelerate the train using a lot of power.   induction motors are more compact than DC motors, so they can fit on trains.

","Diesel engines used for trains are very efficient, but they are very heavy. This is perfect for freight trains, which need a lot of weight on the locomotive in order to generate enough traction to pull the heavy train. High speed trains however are generally lightweight, so they don't need as much traction. But in order to accelerate quickly and reach a high speed, they need a lot more engine power than a freight train does. By making the engine lightweight, they can therefore reduce the amount of power needed to accelerate and maintain speed. So instead of a heavy diesel engine, they would need to use one closer to a car engine, which is less efficient. The French actually planned to make their TGV with a gas turbine, which would be very expensive to run with today's oil prices. It's also worth pointing out that the tracks that are used by high speed trains in Europe and Asia are almost completely electrified anyway, so it's by far the cheapest option. Even freight trains often use electric locomotives in Europe. Speeds above about 125 mph start to require exponentially more power. Since diesel-electric trains carry 100% of their power generation on board, they become very heavy above this speed range, and it's just much more efficient to use offboard generators (electric trains).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 32.89, 'recall': 32.46, 'fmeasure': 32.67}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.25, 'recall': 6.17, 'fmeasure': 6.21}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 18.67, 'recall': 18.42, 'fmeasure': 18.54}}"
"What are septic tanks and what are they used for,more improtantly why do only America have them?",Septic tanks are essentially underground tanks that hold waste. They are used in areas where there is no access to a sewer system. They are used in rural areas where there is no plumbing and need a way to dispose of waste. They are also used in areas where the sewer system is not able to handle large amounts of waste. Septic tanks are used to break down waste into water and sludge. The water can be used for irrigation and the sludge is removed and used as fertilizer. Septic tanks are not just used in America. They are used in many countries around the world.,"A septic tank is a waste solution for buildings that are not connected to a municipal sewer system. It's a big underground tank that's connected to your toilet and you fill it up with shit. Then microbes break down the shit and toilet paper. Eventually you need to have your septic tank pumped. They are very common in houses in rural areas. People in the UK definitely have them. More people in the UK live in city centers like London than in the countryside but people in the middle of nowhere Scotland definitely have septic tanks. Septic tanks do exist in the UK. A septic tank is basically a private sewage treatment system for places not connected to municipal sewers. It's a big tank connected to the sewage line on one side, and a ""leach field"" on the other. Sewage goes into the tank, where it is broken down by enzymes and microbes, before it is fed into the leach field where the soil absorbs the now decontaminated waste.

"Are roundabouts more efficient in cost, speed, and safety than traffic lights?","I can’t give a definitive answer, but I can tell you that roundabouts are generally safer than traffic lights. They are also more efficient in terms of cost and speed. Roundabouts have been around for over 2000 years. They are used in Europe, Australia, and parts of North America. They are designed to reduce the number of crashes. They are also designed to reduce the time it takes to get from one point to another. This is because roundabouts eliminate the need for traffic lights. Roundabouts are also more efficient than traffic lights because they reduce the number of intersections. They also reduce the number of vehicles that need to stop at an intersection. This reduces the amount of time that vehicles spend stopped at an intersection. Roundabouts are also safer than traffic lights because they reduce the number of crashes. They also reduce the number of vehicles that need to stop at an intersection.

They also reduce the number of pedestrian crashes.  ","There is a detailed analysis [here]( URL_0 ) In summary: *Safety* Roundabouts are safer than traditional stop sign or signal-controlled intersections. Roundabouts reduced injury crashes by 75 percent at intersections where stop signs or signals were previously used for traffic control, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). This includes a 90% reduction in fatalities. *Speed* Roundabouts move traffic through an intersection more quickly, and with less congestion on approaching roads. Roundabouts promote a continuous flow of traffic since traffic is not required to stop – only yield – so the intersection can handle more traffic in the same amount of time. Studies by the IIHS of intersections in three states, including Washington, found that roundabouts contributed to an 89 percent reduction in delays and 56 percent reduction in vehicle stops. The only case where this occasionally fails is where the **difference** between peak flow and normal is very high. In this case traffic lights are used to assist the flow at the highest peak. In the UK this is known as a ""gyratory"" *Cost* Where long-term costs are considered, roundabouts eliminate hardware, maintenance and electrical costs associated with traffic signals a saving of between $5,000 and $10,000 per year. One caveat I would make is that understanding how roundabouts work must be part of the driver learning process as it is in the UK. In those cases where roundabouts are rare and drivers not trained to use them there can be problems with drivers making unnecessary stops and not merging with the flow correctly. Roundabouts can work well but they do depend on a few things. If the traffic is very busy indeed, they will lock up, and it depends on people being courteous when using them. Stupidly busy times, lights are better, otherwise roundabouts work better. In the UK they get around this problem in some places by having roundabouts that have traffic lights on them, but the traffic lights only kick in at peak times. Safer, yes, because everybody is, more or less, travelling in the same direction. As for capacity, it depends. There is a lot of science done on it, so depending on the amount of traffic on the connecting roads, different solutions are best. In order, from least traffic to most: * Uncontrolled intersection * Intersection with right of way (assuming the traffic is assymetrical) * Traffic lights * Roundabout * Plane separated intersection In other words, if there is very little traffic, there is no capacity gain, likewise if there is too much traffic, which can cause a roundabout to ""lock up"".","{'rouge1': {'precision': 48.03, 'recall': 25.52, 'fmeasure': 33.33}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.77, 'recall': 4.65, 'fmeasure': 6.08}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.52, 'recall': 10.9, 'fmeasure': 14.24}}"

Car tires did require innertubes in the past, but improvements in manufacturing of both tires and rims have made those needs obsolete. Car tires are steel belted, massively improving their inherent strength; bicycle tires are not. Tubeless tires requires the lip of the tire to have a stiff steel wire.

Is it possible to use dirty water for flushing toilets rather than fresh water? What would be the complications in initiating such a task?, I am aware of the concept of water conservation and it's importance. I am a college student and I am in a dorm room with 4 roommates.

We are aware of the importance of water for our great-grandchildren.  grandchildren.  great-grandchildren.  ,"It is possible, but only worth doing when you really need to save water. Systems that do this are commonly referred to as grey water systems. They gather the runoff from sinks, showers etc and pass it through a basic filter, at which point the water is called gray water. Gray water is then used for flushing toilets or other tasks where cleanliness is only a minor issue. Such a system can be expensive to set up, and does have filtration requirements, the water still needs to be clean enough that flushing the toilet doesn't leave a bunch of gunk in it. The only place I have heard such a system be used are antarctic research stations, where conserving liquid water is quite important. Yes you could, the problem is that you would need to have a whole new water system to bring that water to your house and that would be so costly that no city would do that. Another option would be for the building to recuperate the rain water and use that for thing like flushing toilets. But that increase the building price. The city I lived in was in a severe water shortage. When showering, I would wash my crack then put a 5 gallon bucket over the drain and continued my wash. After a normal shower, the bucket was near full. When done, the grey water could be used to flush the toilet or water the flowers, and would be used up in short order. This works if you have normal adult strength and can move 50 pounds of water around. It is possible to use so called 'grey water' to flush toilts or do other various things that doesn't necessarily need potable water, like watering your lawn for instance. There are some houses set up to capture grey water for use, but its not the norm. It'd be an extra expense when building a house and may or may not be a selling feature for a future buyer. Using grey water has its problems. If you leave grey water for long, it builds bacteria and makes a stink. It also makes a bio film that sticks to surfaces. Now imagine that bathroom that doesn't get used everyday. Someone uses the toilet and flushes the tank. Then they wash their hands and drain goes into the toilet tank.

The FAA does not have any regulations or guidelines that require passengers to turn off their electronic devices during flight.  ","There are a lot of misconceptions every time this subject is brought up. EMI, Electromagnetic Interference, is a serious consideration in aircraft design and operation, and has been for decades. I highly recommend this NASA report from 1995, [PDF here]( URL_0 ), which details several incidents, aviation and otherwise. Probably one of the most famous is the series of five UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters that crashed between 1981 to 1987. The accidents were a mystery for some time, but it was later confirmed that they were caused by signals from radio tower which caused the stabilator to go to a full down position, which put the helicopter in a dive. These accidents earned the UH-60 the nickname ""lawn dart"" at the time. IIRC in the 1990s it was quite common for the crew to instruct passengers to turn off all electronic devices for take off and landing. This is because it was not uncommon for devices to cause things like radio static or in severe cases minor interference with navigation. To be clear, I'm not sure that consumer grade electronics ever posed a deadly threat to commercial aircraft. However, EMI shielding and testing was not nearly as thorough back then as it is now. Part of the reason for that is small electronic devices were not ubiquitous back then. Asking people to simply turn off an electronic device during take off and landing (critical phases of flight for navigation and radio communication) was not a big deal to people back then. It was easier for the FAA to just require that they be turned off, than to require extensive (and expensive) testing. Additionally, I'm not aware of any credible sources which say that the reasoning was that passengers would pay more attention in the event of an emergency. It was certainly my personal experience that back then passengers stuck their noses in magazines and books as much as they do their cell phones and laptops now. If that was ever an official reason it was almost certainly not very effective. **The FAA's decision a few years ago to officially allow electronic devices at all phases of flight was, as far as I can tell, for two reasons: better understanding of the risks because of increased testing, and the fact that we all knew people were doing it anyway.** The TL;DR is that the FAA used to have rules forbidding non-approved devices. They loosened these because they realized it was dumb. Interfering with the planes electronics? Sure, its possible. But RF interference isn't a thing due to FCC certification, and it would have to be an *extremely* noisy device to cause slight interference with gauges. My wife has made phone calls when we've been up flying general aviation, and have had no issues aside from the occasional ""GSM Buzz"" in the headset - same as you'd get with speakers and a GSM phone. Shielding? Nope, not really. Most of the electronics nowadays are digital (which helps), and shielded wires... but no more shielded than the cable you use to charge your phone. And they're not ""hardened"" by any means (unless we're talking military, which is a separate point entirely). The GA stuff I fly personally? Lol... and zero issues with a 1975 airplane (and probably 1990s electronics...) Network congestion on the ground? Likely not - you're more likely to just lose signal and get kicked by the cell system, and not the FAAs problem. Remember, the FAA makes rules for *airplanes* not *cell phones*. Source: Avionics Test Engineer and pilot. Lots of good responses here, and for the most part bang on. I've been involved with the testing and certification of aircraft at my airlinel to allow the use of onboard portable electronic devices, and in some cases onboard transmitting portable electronic devices. In the industry, these are known by the acronym PED or TPED. The rules vary from country to country, but in Canada, before an airline can allow the use of PED or TPED during critical phases of flight, they have to demonstrate that they will not interfere with the onboard aircraft systems. This is commonly accomplished by blasting large amounts of RF inside the aircraft, in various locations throughout the cabin, of varrying frequency and transmitting power. I'll admit, I'm not an engineer, so the details of this test are a little lost on me. Anyway, while the RF storm is being conducted inside the aircraft, we need to test all of the aircraft systems and every possible combination of RF interference. This is done by actually powering up the aircraft, all electrical systems and all the engines. To test our aircraft took two 12 hour days of sitting in the airplane with the engines running and not going anywhere. At the end of the day, I was quite surprised with the results. Our aircraft passed most of the tests, but failed a couple as well. The RF radiation was causing the door proximity (PROX) sensors to fail on the forward cargo door, causing warnings in the cockpit that the door was open, when in actuality it was not. As you can imagine, this wouldn't be a good thing to happen in flight. Long story short, after completion of this testing we can use non-transmitting PEDs in all phases of flight, and we can use Wi-Fi in non critical phases plof flight, but it's the cellphone frequencies that caused our issues so we are not allowed to have cellphones active on cell networks during any phases of flight ( from cabin door close at the start to cabin door open at the end.) Modern aircraft are built with this in mind, and all of this testing is normally completed by the manufacturer during the design and development phases. For older aircraft, this process that I outlined above needs to be completed. I've been told by a friend that is a pilot that the reason for the power down during take off and landing is that those are the most dangerous times when on an aircraft. Therefore, they are hoping that people won't be distracted by their electronics, or god-forbid, create numerous hard plastic and metal projectiles to fly through the cabin in an accident. The last time I flew we still had to power down during take-off and landing. If there was ever any real danger there's no way they'd even let you have them on the plane. Plane crash prevention based on the honor system?? I don't think so... Airline pilot and flight instructor here. The laws (regulations) still forbid the pilot(s) from using unapproved electronics during typical flight and on specific types of instrument approaches (CATII AND III). As for consumer grade electronics, they would interfere with the instruments back when the regulations were written. Here's the ""ELI5"" part: pilots used to navigate with very sensitive electronics called automated direction finders (ADFs). These were essential very sensitive devices that operated on AM radio waves and would tell you the difference in angular deflection between the nose of the aircraft and where the radio beacon was. These radio stations known as Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) were effectively AM radio stations that broadcasted specific morse code identifiers that would let you know that you had the correct station. The ADF however, was sensitive enough that a handheld radio or other strong electromagnetic fields generated by any decent sized and poorly shielded electronics in the cockpit could deflect the bearing pointer on the ADF and cause loss of navigation fidelity in the instrument. In fact, whenever an aircraft would fly near lightning (within 30nm of a cell and honestly far too often) the ADF would deflect to point directly at the lightning strike (which emits all radio wavelengths simultaneously). So the rules were created to prevent erroneous readings from causing airplanes to navigate poorly and geneally into each other or the planet. Ironically, I have a degree in computer engineering with a specialty in radio signals, but I'm not going to weigh in on that aspect of the issue because I don't know enough about avionics to pretend to be an expert. However, there's an important concept in capital-R Risk (the practice of identifying and mitigating risk for corporations) which essentially boils down to ""if the cost of an incident is incredibly high and the cost of mitigation is incredibly low, you pretty much have to do the mitigation."" It costs the airlines almost nothing to enforce the ""turn off your electronics"" rule on each flight. The flight attendants don't make more money for enforcing it, and passengers don't have the option to change to another airline because all airlines enforce it. Thus, cost is approximately zero. However, one crash in which the airline is found to be at fault - a fairly likely scenario if the crash was caused by some avionics fault induced by a heretofore unknown mechanism of electromagnetic interference from a personal device - could cost the airline hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. Thus, you find yourself in a situation where the rate of risk is impossible to measure (we don't know of specific ways that avionics could fail, so we can say low but not precisely how low) but the cost of an incident is definitely extremely, extremely high, and the cost to mitigate the risk is extremely low, approaching zero. Airlines are going to take that deal. Maximum ELI5 answer/TL;DR: If you could eliminate a small risk of suddenly dying by scratching your cheek once a day, you'd scratch your cheek once a day. This was based on the fact lots of navigation radios needs 118-132 MHz clear. Very basic (old) instruments were unable to tell if a signal was interference or legit navigational aids. Back in the day the ""transistor radio"" revolutionized personal audio and the FM transistor radio was even better. So people had these on planes and thought it was much better than the movie, and it was 20 years before cassette tapes. Even eight tracks were 10 years out! Simply put FM radios work using a small local transmitter that ""mixes"" with the incoming signal. This way the incoming signal is converted to 21.4 MHz and a fixed tuned crystal converts that 21.4 MHz signal to audio. Lets say you're listing to 103.1 MHz on the FM band. Your FM radio will be making a signal at 124.5 MHz and ""mixing"" it with the antenna input. This will make 124.5-103.1 and output 21.4 MHz. The problem is it radiates the 124.5 MHz frequency too. In expensive radios they would filter and shield this to make it a non-issue. However in cheap radios, they would radiate this signal. Since 124.5 MHz is in the aircraft band, that would override anything from the ground and interfere with navigation. This is why the electronics ban started. Later on the FCC would make it illegal to use the a radio that generated 124.5 MHz, but that was years after it was banned. Cellular phones were lumped in with this starting in the 90's as the early ones were very high power and could radiate in the radar frequency ranges (1030/1090 MHz). A modern cellular phone will not work in an airplane and is much lower power. When mobile devices started gaining prevalence, airline operators weren't certain the device signals wouldn't interfere with radio signals and other systems on the plane, which could interfere with the plane's operation. Since then, planes have been built with better electromagnetic shielding on their electronics, so those fears haven't really panned out. However, another concern might be that the attempt to connect to cell towers on the ground while traveling several hundred miles per hour - hopping between towers every few seconds - might cause some network congestion on the ground. Regardless, since those regulations were put in place, device makers started introducing ""airplane mode"" features that shut off all device radios. That being prevalent today, airlines now tell passengers either to turn off devices *or* to put them in airplane mode. Aside from the other reasons I've seen here, there's another I've been told. The vast majority of airline crashes happen in the first and last 15 minutes of a flight, aka take off and landing. If a crash were to happen, the entire cabin would rapidly shake and everything would be flying around. They tell people to turn off and put away electronics because that is a lot of stuff flying around and injuring people. Contrary to popular belief, most plane crashes are not fatal, they are more like rough emergency landings. Everything needs to be secure so the cabin doesn't have 100 cell phones flying around hitting people in the face. long answer, yes there was a legitimate reason. the first transistor radio's (1950's, 1960's) were extremely ""noisy"" RF radiation was emitted from the device at much higher levels and did interfere with the instruments in the aircraft. As the FAA is a Gov't institution it moves extremely slow. the Personal Electronic Device(PED) rules were put in place in the 1960's. FAR 91.19 basically putting the prevention and monitoring of EMI on the airline operators. (its easier to tell you not to use it than screen each device for compliance). during the rise of the PC and laptops 1980's this regulation was revised( 20 year gap in regulation change) and again pretty much once each subsequent decade currently FAR 91.21. the change has been twofold One the PED's use less power and emit less RF radiation than older devices. and two aircraft electronics have been required to have more shielding against EMI then previous generations of aircraft. not by the FAA but by the airline operators via requirements sent to the aircraft manufacturers and their vendors. The FAA puts the onus of ensuring that PED's don't interfere with safe operation of the aircraft on the airline operators. Currently all restrictions on PED use inflight are at the discretion of the airline operators. Source: EMI technician; Avionics test technician. TPED testing and more strict qualification testing for critical systems, i.e. Level C and above. Levels are assigned based upon safety impacts based on identified failure modes ranging from No Safety Effect to Catastrophic. Level C represents that there is a failuremodes that may introduce a Major safety impacts, such as significantly higher crew workload (i.e. something fails and it reduces safety margins as pilots need to mitigate it while flying the plane). You can look at the FAA rgl library and see past incidents where transmitting devices were impacting critical systems such as Communication, Surveillance and Navigation radio systems or flickering display units in the flight deck. A prominent one that happened was on Boeing 737s and specific Honeywell display units which would turn off from WiFi and Cellular signals. This forced Boeing to replace all those DUs on new and flying aircrafts, not a cheap nor quick task by any stretch, we're talking millions upon millions of dollars if not more. (Am avionics engineer, deal with this kind of certification a lot. In summary, we build critical systems that are more resilient to external emissions.) If you wanted to get really in-depth with it I would suggest the RTCA documents DO-297 and DO-307. For qualification testing Section 20 in DO-160 has your susceptibility requirements. There's two types of coupling identified in aviation, Backdoor Coupling, i.e. like a device causing interference with an Display Unit and causing it to flickering, or introducing interference on the cabling. The other is Front Door Coupling and primarily applies to radio systems that have interference being introduced on their intended receive frequencies. I.e. say my ILS Glideslope is 335MHz and something transmits on this frequency. ILS is an instrument landing system primarily used for low visibility landing, i.e. CAT II and above. We generally have to assume that if there's not enough pathloss to the antenna to prevent coupling of an interference on the same frequency this may cause the ILS system to mislead and go off target and mislead the pilot or autopilot. This is Catastrophic as you will rely upon those systems in low visibility landing situations. It's another thing to 'jam' the system as this will notify the pilot of the failure and they can correct it through their procedures, resulting in a Major hazard. The notification failuremodes however to warn the pilot of a failure is Catastrophic, however. For part 25 aircrafts, such as your normal commercial airliner, AC 25.1309 provides in Appendix 2 I think a list of example failure modes and their hazard effects (called a Functional Hazard Analysis or Assessment -- FHA). The FAA PED ARC report is also another great resource that really summarizes backdoor and front door coupling hazards. Non 18 paragraph answer: they used to not know what cell phones, laptops, etc would do to planes electronics so they went with better safe than sorry. Now they know they won't interfere so they let you use them. Technically, there was probably no reason to power them down. However, there was speculation that it could potentially interfere with the aircrafts electronics or navigation equipment. Better safe than sorry. We in the airline industry are terribly sorry for the super inconvenient shutting off of your phone, we know this is a close call on if it's worse to shut off your phone for a few minutes or to have everyone on the flight die. I remember watching a documentary called ""Journeys with George "" about the 2000 election. In that movie, the press plane had a mechanical issue and they moved the governor (bush), and the entire press to a new plane immediately and every single reporter and election staff were on mobile phones for most of the takeoff and landing. There was secret service, all sorts of people. From that moment forward, I never used airplane mode ever again, and I flew weekly for ten of those sixteen years. This video should clear things up for you guys. URL_0 Interference, allegedly. However, the Mythbusters crew were unable to cause any interference using a **wide** variety of cellphones (new and old), and a slew of different airplane systems. URL_0 Sadly this is not true all around the world. I recently endured a 20~ hour journey on China Southern where for some unknown reason mobile phone use is banned throughout flights, even listening to music on flight mode etc. The FAA specifically allowed it. That's literally the only reason, not complex or anything like some of the people here are trying to make it out to be. URL_0 2013. Before that time, yes, you still had to turn off electronics during takeoff Air traffic controller. For obvious reasons we can't have devices on or in our work spaces! However, I do know the old analog cellular phones could sometimes leak (locally) and we would hear like a Morse code rapid ping on our frequencies. Maybe since everything is now digital in nature it doesn't interfere with the old com systems anymore? My mentor in university was an airline engineer. He told me that consumer grade electronics have never been a problem. If they actually were, turning them off would not be on the honor system. The real reason according to him was due to cell phones connecting to different towers across different states and the constant connections caused problems for early cell phone carriers. Whenever the answer is a long and complicated one, filled with mumbo jumbo and requires lots of details to try to make it fit...its BS We used cell phones and all sorts of other electronic devices including walkie-talkies during takeoffs and landings during my Secret Service days 1989-1995 and those were old planes... The truth is airlines want an excuse for pilot error and to mitigate their own legal responsibilities, end of story. It had to do with fears that a cell phone could somehow interest with the planes electronics or radio communication, and in the case of an accident would help to reduce the number of small hard things flying around the cabin. Ultimately they have realized that cell phones aren't nearly powerful enough to interfere. And in an accident the cell phones become a non issue neways (in a hard enough crash to where they would be dangerous, the people are dead anyways). News to me... In Europe they still require you to at least switch on flight mode during take off and landing. I once spend an afternoon reading a collection of airline staff reports on the subject: (Only very few) pilots reported noise on their radio headset during landing and take off. It was assumed that this noise was caused by passenger devices constantly trying to connect with antennas on the ground, searching for service. For example, one pilot who experienced noise after passengers were asked to switch off devices had his cabin crew go through the plane to check manually whether all devices were shut down. They found one device still running, they switched it off, and reportedly the problem was now solved. No research or tests have been able to replicate these problems though. So why is airplane mode a thing or at least why is it called that? I'll try to keep it real short. & nbsp; Basically it was known that it was possible that electronics could create interference, nothing ever happened with regards to interference, so they lightened the restrictions. If there was a legit need for them to be off they wouldn't let you still keep them and just take your word for it because it can do the same thing whether it is in your bag or in your hands actively. Also, not unrelated, there was an American Airlines windshear crash that happened right around the time cellphones became commonplace. Just so happened we didn't understand a lot about windshear during that time, and while the investigation went on - they questioned whether or not it had to do with cell phones. Immediately changed the rules to disallow them. In typical FAA fashion, it took this long to come back around. I asked a friends dad who flew dash 8's in the 80's-90's and he said that with the old analog phones and older planes that weren't shielded as well it would cause the navigation systems to go screwy. nothing major that they didnt know how to deal with, but it was annoying and if other systems failed potentially a problem. Newer planes have all the wiring shielded and modern cell phones use way lower power than the old ones. There was a legitimate reason originally: some electronics produced large electromagnetic interference fields (a form of radiation) that could interfere with the communications and controls of a passenger plane. It was too difficult to educate flight attendants adequately to have them making the judgment calls item by item on what to allow, so the rule was a blanket ""no devices"". Subsequently, aircraft manufacturers have ""hardened"" most of the critical elements of newer aircraft. The term ""harden"" in this case means to make electrical systems resistant to electromagnetic radiation. There are still holdouts, and the industry is rightfully very conservative about what they allow. ok the reason for aircraft to request power down of electronics were due to during that era of the 1st gen mobile phone are using the similar frequencies of what the clockpit is using for their transmitters. since everything were analog signalling back then, cross talk happens. this causes interference to the signal and can cause disaster. well if you work in the aircraft industries, you will know that to change a certain SOP (standard operating procedures) is a heck of problem because there are so many steps to do, so many files to re-document, so many approval to make, so many debunking to prove and proposing of a better/proven solution etc. for that (generally laziness in updating the rules and that much of time wasted just to update it) is the reason why till 2016 it is STILL a requirement to power down the electronics during takeoff and landing. so now, someone/some group actually read into that and did the updating hence this powering down is no longer needed. the science behind this is that, since now all devices are running on Octagonal signal(digitized), signal cannot be interfere in this manner. just imagine, phones is running on an example frequency, 2.1ghz, if it is like the older days where by technology is still running on a single plane (frequency plane), then there will be full of collision and interference. but now, since it is digitized, it is running on not just the frequency plane (FDMA), it is also running on time plane (TDMA) and also on coding plane (CDMA). so it means that to really interfere a signal, you need the precise frequency at the correct hop of time at the correct position of phase. this is why the current radio doesn't interfere with airplane take off or landing. there are more to this but this is suffice. i work in telco and i'm a radio expert. my best friend fly commercial airline, he is an expert in airplane stuff and was a geek to that. i asked this question many many years before while i studied radio and realised your question and have asked him. I always thought that it was just so that you listen to the safety demonstration or the pilots instructions. Why do service stations not allow use of mobile phones near bowsers, yet allow me to use my radio key to lock the car? Literally just watched a YouTube video about it today. I'm new to the sub, so I'm not sure if this is allowed (pls let me know) URL_0 We still have to power everything down in China, and can't have phones on at any point, even in airplane mode. Of course, most people do their best to ignore the rules. I bet there is a group of terrorists who have dressed and acted under the guise of being a techie and has been trying for years to take down planes by carrying as many electronics as possible! I was once told my cell phone could cause Electromagnetic interference to aircraft systems, I replied how about the 1000's of phones within a mile of this aircraft why wouldn't they interfere with the plane as well. My point was that phones do not affect plane electronics. Related slightly, as in a practice that continues where it may not need to. Isn't it true that mobile phones can be used at a gas station and it's actually static from car to human that causes spontaneous fires? Sane people, please don't test this theory, you may just blow up. Candidates for the Darwin award, you just carry on. In the past many electronic devices had analog signals and noisy power supplies. Analog signals are high powered and operate over a broad range of frequencies. Newer, digital electronics can operate at much lower power levels and operate at specific frequencies that can be tuned out of aircraft sensor systems. Add to that, many aircraft systems are digital now and resist interference better than analog system. Only interference I've ever seen in the flight deck is if a cell phone is left off of airplane mode, and begins searching for service, you can hear a static in the headset. It's much like putting a blackberry beside an old computer speaker and can hear that pulsing static sound. Phone has to be relatively close to the headset cord to cause this. Not a huge issue these days though more just an annoyance. Some airline companies such as Air China still forbid the use of cell phones at all phases of flight. I was used to keeping it on since I'm from Canada and we never require airplane mode, but I was approached by one of the flight attendants who sternly told me to turn my phone off even though my phone was in airplane mode and I was watching an offline video.

Why did the Titanic's watertight compartments not have a watertight top?," In fact, the Titanic did have watertight tops. But they were not watertight enough. The watertight tops were made of steel plates with 1/4 inch thickness, which was not enough to withstand the water pressure. The water pressure was about 20 pounds per square foot. The watertight tops were only designed to withstand 10 pounds per square foot. So, the watertight tops were not watertight enough.","Expense, and the fact that it would have been seen as a needless expense and probably gotten in the way. Even as designed, if they hadn't hit the iceberg in such a way as to tear the whole side open, they probably would have been fine and the bulkheads would have been sufficient. They didn't need to be watertight at the top, as long as the top would sit above the waterline when that compartment was flooded. Remember, water will only rise to the waterline, no higher. As long as the ship was buoyant enough to remain afloat with the weight of water in that compartment, and would not sink low enough for that water to flood over the watertight section into other sections, the buoyancy wouldn't be compromised. It's the same principle as an ordinary canoe. The top isn't watertight, yet the boat floats, because the water cannot rise above the edges of the canoe to flood the interior. The reason the Titanic sank so fast isn't because the compartments weren't watertight at the top, but because *so many* compartments were flooded by the massive gash (possibly also because the crew was slow to seal them, but I'd have to look that up to verify).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.27, 'recall': 14.49, 'fmeasure': 22.06}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.06, 'recall': 1.88, 'fmeasure': 2.87}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.85, 'recall': 9.35, 'fmeasure': 14.23}}"

How do pilots who speak different languages communicate with each other / air traffic control?,"I've never been in an airplane with a pilot who speaks a language other than English. But I've been in planes where the pilots speak different English dialects, so I can imagine it would be a bit difficult to communicate. But I'm sure they do their best to use hand signals and drawings to convey their message. Pilots are trained to communicate with people who speak different languages. It's a big part of their training. They're taught to use hand signals and drawings to communicate and to use different words for things. For example, ""left"" might mean ""left"" in English, but in Spanish it means ""correcto"". The same is true for ""right"". So, they use hand signals and drawings to communicate and they use words in the language that is most commonly spoken in that area.","All pilots are required to know how to speak English, as are the people in the control tower. That way, everybody has a language they can all communicate in. As others have said, English is the international language of aviation, and there are some specific phrases that pilots are required to know in order to be able to communicate in English. However, there are two important pieces of information missing: - Not all airports use English. Some smaller airports which are mostly used by private hobby pilots use the local language. Some airports use a mix of English and the local language. Each country publishes a list of all the airports within the country, with a load of information about each airport, and one piece of information that's published is which language is spoken at each airport. For example, at many smaller French airports, air traffic control only work during normal working hours, but after air traffic control is closed, the airport still remains open but all communication is in French. This information is published to pilots by the French authorities. - Even when the language is English, some pilots and controllers insist on using the local language. There was an accident in France many years ago (sorry, I don't remember the details and don't have time to find them right now) where a factor in the accident was that the French pilot was speaking French to the French air traffic controller. The air traffic controller made a mistake and cleared a British aircraft to take off when the French aircraft was still on the runway. Had the British pilot been able to understand the communication between air traffic control and the French pilot, he probably would have realised the mistake and questioned the instruction to take off, but because he didn't understand what was going on with the other aircraft, he had no way of knowing the runway was occupied, and followed the air traffic controller's incorrect instruction to take off. There is a specific list of English phrases all pilots must know - called Aviation English. It is designed to cover almost any situation and even designed to minimise any issues accents can cause.

"If large buildings are made of concrete, shouldn't they be able to build it so a fire can't spread from one floor to another?","The CO2 in the drink is in a liquid state.

The big, heavy steel doors to the stairways that close automatically are designed to keep the fires from spreading from floor to floor. That's why bldg security goes apeshit when they're propped open or the hydraulic closer is broken or disabled. We simply cannot make a building 100% fireproof. Even with concrete and steel, there is plenty of flammable material inside a building. We rate materials in time, meaning how much time they can resist fire. Over time we developed norms that tell you how much time different elements should be able to resist depending on what type of building it is. There is also specification in term of sprinkler systems and evacuation. The problem is that a building is suppose to stay up for decades so a lot of building are not up to the current standard. The London Tower was built in 1974 for example. We can't either just ask everybody to follow the current standard because it would cost astonishing amount of money to do so. This would mean that some building would be simply abandoned because the owned couldn't pay for the renovation. An abandoned building would be even worst as a fire hazard. It would also not only affect big business, but also house owner. If you force everybody to follow the current standard, that mean home too. And the same thing would happen there, people without enough cash to renovate their home could lose everything. So you need to balance things out between security and economical reality. It isn't practical to design a building as you describe. Electrical wires need to be run through conduit, ventilation passages need to exist, plumbing goes somewhere it can be accessed for maintenance, elevator shafts need to be open and straight. How do you design a stairway that humans can traverse but a 40-foot blast of flame can't? Add to that the fact concrete can crumble under extreme heat and you can make buildings fire-*resistant* but not completely fire-proof. Easy to do if all you have is a bare concrete shell. Start putting anything into the building and adding finishes on top of that concrete, and you'll have materials that can burn. Add any ducts for heat/air, plumbing, and electrical, and you've got penetrations between the floors (in addition to elevator and stairways. So yes, you can build it that way, but it would be useless. No one wants to live in a fireproof concrete block. An iron stove is fire proof. When you add fuel and ventilation everything in it burns. That is what happens with a concrete, fire proof shell of a building. It is fireproof until it's decorated and filled with furniture. If you are referring to the London building then that was retrofitted with cladding made of polyethylene which is combustible. I can't explain why anyone would do this. They do the best they can. A lot of new buildings have shafts that allow HVAC, Plumbing, and fire protection to pass floor to floor. The shafts are usually protected by 3hr fire rated sheet rock walls or concrete. Now speaking only on HVAC side. Whenever a duct system passes through a fire rated wall (usually 1 1/2hr) it has a fire damper or combination Fire/smoke damper. rated for 1hr or 3hr. The dampers have a UL rating of UL555 for fire damper, UL 555S for smoke dampers, UL555C for Fire/smoke dampers. No building is really fireproof, so these act to hinder fire and smoke spread and give fire and rescue time to act.

Tires in 4x4 MUST skip if not going straight forward, and will thus lose traction which is not safe. AWD does not force tires to skip. Medium answer: At low speeds, with tires skidding, or offroad, you spin on some dirt or loose gravel or leaves or whatever, that's fine, you just chew up the turf. On pavement (high speeds generally), tires will try to force the vehicle to go in a straight line, and if steered anywhere but straight (to follow the road), the tires in 4x4 MUST slip because the ground (pavement) can't slip like gravel or dirt can. Longer answer: AWD means that the vehicle can turn all 4 wheels. This versus FWD or RWD where two wheels have power and the others are just free spinning and not connected to anything. Think of them like the front wheel on a bicycle, it spins but it never powers the bike, turning pedals only turns the back tire. A problem (not a necessary one, just, the way they're usually built) with FWD or RWD is that if one tire leaves the ground, or is slipping... ZERO power goes to the wheel that has grip. So imagine being stopped on the side of the road, one tire on the pavement, one tire on ice or mud in the ditch. You're thinking ""That's fine, one drive tire is still on pavement, I have half the grip I normally do but it'll move fine""... NOPE. Mechanically, 100% of the power goes to the stupid tire that can't provide any traction at all, and the tire on pavement that could easily pull your car out of the ditch just sits there with its thumb up its ass while it's buddy revs away like the roadrunner. ""That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, why not just power both wheels?"" That is because the cars HAVE to be built that way, and it's actually a neat trick that this is possible. A ""differential"" is a mechanical Y-splitter that lets the 2 power wheels spin at different speeds. This is absolutely necessary because when turning, the outside wheel has to spin farther than the inside wheel, it's a long path to go the longer way around. ""Really? The wheels being all of 4 feet apart makes a noticeable difference to the distance they have to travel? Bullshit!"" No bullshit. If the left tire has to travel a 100 foot arc on a gradual turn, and the right tire has to travel even 110 foot arc on the outside of that turn (a gradual turn)... that means if you force them both to travel 105 feet, each is skipping. The inside is losing traction and shoving it's way barkwards in little micro-lurches (covering the same ground twice, to add the extra feet) as the tire compresses and skids, and the outside is losing traction and popping forward (to skip ground, travel less distance). How much? 5 feet on the turn. 5 feet is a lot of skidding. ""So what did they use before the differential was invented? I don't believe that."" Well, two points. One, a lot more dirt roads back then, even in town, differentials are old. And two, they only powered a single 1 wheel out of the 4. All the others spun free. So, all cars that drive 2 wheels have differentials that allow them to turn at different speeds. A necessary side effect of this is that any tire that loses traction on mud or ice is mechanically identical to turning a corner, the slipping tire is like the outside tire in a turn, it wants to spin much faster than the tire with grip, and the differential mechanically allows this. So, AWD is way better than just front or rear wheel drive for any kind of traction. All 4 tires can be spinning. And they usually add complexity so that there isn't infinite amounts of slip in the differential. But they might not. In general, with only mild amounts of slippage, AWD is amazing because it evens out all the differences in traction and can turn all 4 tires. ""So what is the difference between AWD and 4WD? All 4 tires are powered on both."" Yes. 4WD is a simplified version of AWD where all axles are just locked and forced to turn the same speed no matter what. 3 out of 4 tires stuck in mud and you're towing a trailer? No problemo, that 1 tire with grip will still turn and drag the whole vehicle if it can. Great for offroading. It means that any time you're not going straight forward, tires have to slip. That's not a big deal at low speeds on crappy terrain, it'll just spit dirt or ice as it skids on corners. Unlike on pavement which, you can't just shove around with the tire, so the tire itself has to lose grip and lurch. At high speeds on pavement, a 4x4 would basically force only 1 tire to ever have traction at a time, the other 3 all slipping, or ignoring your attempts to turn and instantly drifting. Not safe. Even 80kph (~50mph) is pretty ludicrous. Some AWDs have different amounts of sometimes computer controlled ""slip"" in the differential. So, they can slip partially, but not fully. Which is really what you want for everything but offroading. Make sense? So there's a difference between 4WD and AWD. 4WD drives all 4 wheels, all at the same time. AWD chooses which wheels to send power to depending on the need. Some systems are better than others, but a lot of them (like the Haldex system) are basically front wheel drive, and then send power to the rear wheels as it realizes the front tires are losing grip. What you're talking about is vehicles that have PART TIME 4WD. There is another difference between full time 4wd and part time. Any part time system is generally not recommended to use in ""high traction"" driving, so dry pavement or streets can cause damage to the drivetrain if you leave it in 4wd mode. AWD systems would just divert power to the front wheels, and full time 4wd systems can negotiate the speed differential between the front and rear tires. Generally, part time systems are not as complex. They will try and send equal power to the front and rear tires. However, your front wheels tend to rotate faster than the rears, and differences in tire tread or pressure can exacerbate this difference. This can cause the front tires to slip, which can lead to dangerous problems if you're at a high speed. TL;DR Don't use part time 4WD if you don't need to. 4WD locks the front and rear axles together mechanically. It's either on or off. AWD uses an differential to change how much each axle is used. Sometimes this differential is adjustable by the computer.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 64.97, 'recall': 8.59, 'fmeasure': 15.18}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.03, 'recall': 2.11, 'fmeasure': 3.73}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 40.13, 'recall': 5.31, 'fmeasure': 9.37}}"

how do window air conditioners (units that are not central but not mobile) keep on giving cold goodness without any kind of refill or coolant? Will it ever run out of coolness?,"The refrigerant is compressed, and the heat is transferred to the air outside. This is done by a compressor that is powered by electricity. The refrigerant is then compressed to a higher pressure and transferred to the coils inside the unit. This causes the refrigerant to expand and cool. The heat is then transferred from the coils to the air outside the unit. The refrigerant is then compressed again and the cycle continues.","I don't think you understand how air conditioners work, based off the nature of your question. Coolant doesn't supply coolness like gasoline supplies energy. Air conditioning works by compressing the coolant gas until it becomes a liquid. This compression creates heat which is radiated away into the outside air by the fan blowing outside air over the coil. The compressed liquid is then pumped ""inside"" the house into an evaporator coil. This allows the liquid refrigerant to convert back to a gas. As this phase change occurs, heat is absorbed from the surrounding air, which is usually inside air circulated over the evaporating coil. This cools down the air being passed over the coil. That cool air is then blown into the inside of the house as air conditioning. The refrigerant is then pumped into the outside portion of the air conditioner to be compressed. In essence, heat is created by compression and dissipated with outside air. When the refrigerant evaporates, it absorbs a similar amount of heat, which cools the inside air that is circulated through the house. The only thing that gets consumed is energy that drives the compressor and the fans that circulate air. Since the coolant travels in a closed loop, there is no need to refill unless there is a leak. To explain like you're 5: Air conditioners work by moving heat to the outside of the room. The special conveyor belt that moves the heat is the coolant, but like a conveyor belt, it doesn't get thrown out or used up. First, let's get rid of a common misconception. 'Cold' cannot be made, there is no such thing as 'cold'; there are only amounts of heat. 'Cold' is simply a state of less heat. One of the first things humans figured out was how make heat; more recently, we figured out how to move it from a place where we want less to heat to a place where we don't care about the heat level. To move heat, we exploit the properties of gas. Namely, the fact that when a gas expands, it absorbs heat. To maximize this, we compress the gas until it forms a liquid, then pass it through a tiny orifice into an area of low pressure where it can evaporate and soak up the maximum amount of heat. This happens in a closed loop, so the heated gas returns to the compressor and is re-compressed into a liquid. Strictly speaking, the compressor cannot compress the gas into a liquid, it simply increases the pressure of the gas. The gas exiting the compressor is too hot to condense (and liquids don't compress much, so liquid in the compressor would break it) - it still contains all the heat it absorbed, but now takes up much less space, so it's temperature goes way up. This is actually a good thing, because it raises the temperature of the gas to a point that is well above the outside temperature, allowing the air surrounding the condensing coil to absorb the heat carried outside, cooling the gas and allowing it to condense back into a liquid which makes it ready to evaporate again. They are constantly refilled with electricity and will stop giving coolness the second they get no electricity. It's also wrong that they ""give coolness"". What they do is move heat from inside the room to outside (and actually add some additional heat in the process). Think of them like a pump - and in fact that kind of mechanism is called a ""heat pump"". The same mechanism is used by refrigerators, or in reverse by some heating systems (which move heat from the ground into your house even though the house is already warmer than the ground). The coolant in an air conditioner is like a sponge. It removes heat from your house the same way you would remove water from a bucket with a sponge. The air conditioner in this analogy works like your hand squeezing the sponge. It exposes the coolant to your hot house which sucks up heat like a sponge would suck up water. It then exposes the coolant to the outside and squeezes it like you would a sponge to get the heat out. The difference between a sponge and the coolant is that the coolant is a gas so the air conditioner can't let the gas actually touch the air. When an air conditioner needs more coolant, it is because it has a leak and the coolant escaped. This happens more often in home systems because there is a long line from the outside actually unit to your inside unit and it's much easier to get a hole. The window AC units are compact and self contained so it's much less likely that they'll get a leak. They have a refrigerant, it's just permanently sealed in, and not spent during operation. The only reason for an air conditioner to lose refrigerant is mechanical failure like faulty pipes or seals. It works the same for all air conditioners, whether mobile or not. Phase change of compressed gas is what makes your AC cold, think spray cans getting cold when you spray them, like paint, air duster, whipped cream. Except it's a closed loop system. Gas is compressed, hot side, then sent to the expansion valve and coil, cold side, then returned to be compressed again, hot side again. No gas is lost unless there is a leak. It's the same as your home, except much smaller and compact. It still has a coil, blower, and condenser, just all in and a small package. An air conditioner is basically the same thing as a fridge or freezer, except you're in it! Just like the fridge takes out the heat out of your food and pumps it out on the backside - the air conditioner takes the heat from your house and moves it outside! An air conditioner wouldn't work if it wasn't externally connected, just like you can't just open the fridge door to make it share it's good coldness - it'd pump out just heat as much on the backside (more actually) as it's cooling in the front. So how does a fridge work? URL_0 As a further question/clarification - why does the ac unit in your car need to be recharged? Is it not on a closed loop? Already some great answers here, but I'd like to add that you don't need to refill it with coolant, but you do need to ""refill"" it with electricity. Constantly. In order to pull heat out of one space and push it into another space, an AC/refrigerator needs tons of power. Usually it gets this power from electricity that comes from an outlet in the wall. In the case of a vehicle, it gets power from an engine. In the case of an RV, maybe it gets the power from a propane tank or something. Coolant is not the fuel. But there is still a fuel requirement.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 83.56, 'recall': 5.12, 'fmeasure': 9.64}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 36.11, 'recall': 2.18, 'fmeasure': 4.12}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 64.38, 'recall': 3.94, 'fmeasure': 7.43}}"

Why are European curbs 3-5 centimeters tall (and don't destroy tires) while American curbs are 6 inches (15 centimeters) tall and shred tire sidewalls.,"In the US, the curbs are 6 inches tall to accommodate the larger vehicles that we have. The 6 inch height also provides a better slope for the tires to follow. The 3-5cm curbs in Europe are much more shallow. The reason for this is that the streets in Europe are much more narrow than in the US. The width of the street in Europe is typically 20-30 feet (6-9 meters) vs 30-40 feet (9-12 meters) in the US. This means that there is less room for larger vehicles and therefore the curbs are lower to avoid the tires getting caught on them.","American curbs are there to protect pedestrians, protect drivers from driving off the road, protect landscaping beyond the curb, to retain and direct storm water in the road. The height is just easier to use in a design phase due to it being 0.50 feet rather than 0.33. Curbs 3-5 centimeters are tripping hazards, not ADA compliant and serve little purpose from a storm water standpoint. Normally, European curbs are ~12cm, they are only 3-5cm when parking on the curb is allowed/encouraged which is mostly just due to the fact that streets are narrower so you actually have to park on the curb. Standard kerbs^1 here in the UK are about 15cm (I can't be bothered to go out and measure one, but it's about that size) We do have what are usually called ""dropped kerbs"" where pedestrians are expected to cross so wheelchairs / pushchairs can get up / down more easily, or where a driveway meets a road or the like. Those are about 3-5cm tall. Occasionally, there will be a longer dropped kerb where a section of pavement is dual use, such as a shared footpath / cycle path, or where a bus lane crosses a footpath or whatever.

Why are Diesel engines more fuel efficient than gas/petrol engines?,"I think it has to do with the fact that people are more likely to stay inside and not go out and shop during the winter months. So there is less demand for products, which means that companies can lower their prices to try to get more customers. The opposite is true in the summer, when there are more people outside and there is more demand for products, so companies can raise their prices.","A few reasons: Diesel contains more energy per mass unit than gasoline, meaning that you have to burn less fuel to get the same amount of power out of the engine. Diesel engines run with a much higher compression ratio than gasoline engines. This increases the expansion space during the ignition/combustion part of the engine cycle allowing more energy to be extracted from the fuel burn. One more point to add: gas/petrol engines rely on a spark plug to ignite the fuel. This means that you must put in enough fuel to guarantee that at least a tiny bit is close enough to the plug to ignite when it sparks. This is sometimes more fuel than is required to make the power needed, especially at idle and sometimes during easy highway cruising. Diesel engines do not have spark plugs and just compress the air until it is so hot that the fuel ignites. This means that it does not need fuel in a specific location inside the combustion chamber, so you can put in only the bare minimum required to create the power needed at that moment. This saves a lot of fuel at idle and a little bit under cruising conditions. At the same pressure, the diesel cycle is less efficient than the otto cycle. However as you increase the pressure differential, you increase the overall efficiency. It just so happens that diesels require higher pressures than gas engines to work. They're not: diesel fuel simply has more energy (48 MJ/kg; 35.8 MJ/L) than gas/petrol (46.4 MJ/kg; 34.2 MJ/L). It's not that diesel engines are more efficient, it's that less diesel fuel is required to generate the same amount of energy.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 50.0, 'recall': 12.54, 'fmeasure': 20.05}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.85, 'recall': 1.7, 'fmeasure': 2.72}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 28.38, 'recall': 7.12, 'fmeasure': 11.38}}"
Why aren't war planes painted in light blue colors?," ELI5: Why are war planes painted in camouflage colors? War planes are painted in camouflage colors to help them blend in with their surroundings. This helps them avoid detection by enemy radar and other sensors. The colors are chosen to blend in with the colors of the sky, the ground, and the vegetation of the area where the plane is likely to be flying. The colors are often shades of green, brown, and grey, which are the colors of the natural environment. The colors are not blue because blue is not a common color in the natural environment. It is also a color that is easily visible to the human eye, so it would not help the plane blend in with its surroundings.","Some planes [like this Bf-109]( URL_0 ) were painted light blue on their underside and ground colored on the top side. But without its own illumination the plane is always going to be darker than the daylight sky behind it. And with advances in radar technology there's barely any point since you'll detect the aircraft long before you can see it with your eyes. Planes are usually ""spotted"" electronically rather than visually. Some of the paint is radar absorbing making the plane stealthier. Modern anti-aircraft weapons use heat or radar signatures to track. The anti-aircraft guns of yesteryear simply tried to fill the sky with as much shrapnel as possible, so super accuracy wasn't important. Planes are also simply fast moving. If you don't have radar (or were in a war before it's invention) you usually didn't have much time to DO something about planes before they were right on top of you. You'd have a hard time actually hitting the fast targets, and they like to make their mission as short as possible so you have less of a chance: drop the bombs and get outta there. Colour doesn't really impact that much. A plane up against the sky is going to be fairly easy to see. ""air"" is actually quite bright thanks to all the light bouncing around through it. The aircraft block that light and so at a distance appear as dark spots. Being sky blue wouldn't matter. Up close on the other hand, well ww2 aircraft conducted dogfights at very close range. couple hundred meters. At that range camouflage isn't helping. There are a few times where cammo does work. Night fighters and bombers, counter intuitively would often have lights attached to em. Someone's covered Yehudi lights below, but sunrise and sunset also worked if you could keep the sun to your back. Recon aircraft were often painted to take advantage of this, hence why you can find images of [pastel pink spitfires]( URL_2 ) Older aircraft were instead painted to make them harder to spot *from above*. You really don't want someone in a fighter aircraft diving at you from above, that situation puts you at a disadvantage. hence why you can find the ususal green spitfiresand also brownish ones like [this]( URL_1 ) and why the seafires (spitfires modified for carriers) looked like [this]( URL_3 ). Other nations did similar things of course as did other british aircraft, but I've got a spitfire theme going and we're rolling with that. Of course many aircraft, especially modern ones, are unpainted. With modern radar and infrared tracking and etc cammo designed to fool the human eye doesn't help much. Paint weighs the aircraft down and modern militaries have largely decided to dispense with the weight except for what's needed for various markings. Also in the very modern era, paint is obviously going to get in the way of the radar absorbent materials and what not, and could end up making the aircraft easier to find. Unpainted metal of of course greyish, while a lot of radar absorbent material is usually a darkish grey or even black. (I mean I guess those coatings count as paint?)

Why do cop cars have the small hub on the wheel instead of the entire rim or hubcab?,"Because it’s cheaper and lighter. The hubcaps are the same for all cars, and are only changed when the tire is rotated. The police cars are used a lot, so the cost of the hubcaps adds up. The hubcabs are also stronger and more resistant to damage. The police cars are also used in a lot of different conditions, so the hubcaps are designed to be easy to change. The small hubcaps are also easier to replace when the tire is flat.","Because when you're buying a fleet of police cars, leaving the hubcaps off can: * save you money on the overall cost of the cars * save you money on maintenance (replacing hubcaps) * make maintenance easier * keep all the cars looking standard and professional (no missing or cracked hubcaps) Doing a bit of googling, the consensus seems to be because hubcaps fall off when you drive aggressively...and cops do that a lot. Better to have hubcaps that don't fall off so they don't need to blow money replacing them. To avoid valve stem damage. This was answered on ""Car Talk"" some years ago. Police cars risk losing hubcaps during aggressive maneuvers, and there is greater risk of damaging the valve stem (thus risking a flat) with a full hubcap, thus the smaller hubcaps. I think another thing to add is that to the other answers is that it is a signature look. An unmarked car might still have them while a civilian car will often have plain steel rims. It is something I usually spot before the hidden lights in the grill or rear deck.

Communication: Satellites are used to send and receive data. They can be used to send data from one place to another, or to send data to a large number of places at once. 2. Navigation: Satellites can be used to navigate the Earth. They can be used to determine your location, and to provide information about the location of other things. 3. Surveillance: Satellites can be used to monitor the Earth. They can be used to look at the Earth from above, to monitor what is happening on the Earth's surface, and to collect information about the Earth's weather. 4. Weather Forecasting: Satellites can be used to collect data about the weather. They can be used to monitor the weather, and to predict what the weather will be like in the future. 5. Research: Satellites can be used to conduct research. They can be used to study the Earth, to study the universe, and to conduct experiments. 6. Entertainment: Satellites can be used to entertain people. They can be used to broadcast television and radio programs, and to provide access to the Internet.","It's an orb filled with various inert noble gasses with an electrode in the center that sends out a constant current of very small amplitude towards the insulated glass orb, in order to create a pleasant looking effect.

The difference is velocity is very close to zero so it is hard to even measure the force applied to the ISS. When docking there is a tiny impact but again the difference in velocity is very low so very little momentum is transfered. The much larger problem for the ISS is the tiny impacts with air molecules as it travels around the Earth in the ionosphere. ISS is placed as low as possible while still able to do its mission which means that it experience a lot of drag and even lift from its solar panels and other instruments. And the atmospheric conditions are very rough at that altitude. So the ISS gets tossed around quite a bit (relatively speaking) on a daily basis. To correct its attitude it have several gyroscopes on board. It can also use the solar panels and radiators as wings and rudders if needed. To correct the drag there is periodic reboosts.

how does fuel injector inject fuel into the engine without lighting on fire? Since the engine is under combustion.,"There are a few things that help prevent the fuel from igniting. First, the fuel is injected into the cylinder in a fine spray. Second, the fuel injector is heated to around 1000 degrees Fahrenheit to vaporize the fuel. Finally, the fuel injector has a tiny nozzle that is surrounded by a tiny venturi. The venturi causes the airflow that is being injected into the cylinder to increase in pressure, which helps push the fuel into the combustion chamber. This is called ""self-aspirating"" and it's a very efficient way to inject fuel.","Unless you're looking at a direct injection engine, the fuel injection doesn't happen at the place where the combustion happens (the combustion chamber). The injection happens at the intake plenum. In direct injection engines, like some Honda and Toyota gas engines, and diesel engines, the previous combusted mixture is already expelled from the combustion chamber before new fresh uncombusted air is pulled. Let's assume that we are discussing a 4 (or 6 or 8 etc) cylinder 4-stroke engine. The 4-strokes correspond to 4 different stages: 1) INTAKE. This is where the fuel injector injects fuel into the cylinder. 2) COMPRESSION. The piston inside the cylinder moves up increasing the pressure of the fuel. 3) COMBUSTION. The spark plug lights the fuel on fire forcing the piston back down. 4) EXHAUST. Gasses and stuff left over from combustion leave the cylinder. The important part is that while fuel is being injected into the cylinder, that isn't the one that is in combustion. This is why we have multiple cylinders. This is also true for a 2-stroke engine where steps 1 and 2 are combined and 3 and 4 are combined. I know this is an old video but I really love how this guy explains things. URL_0 as far as I know it is because it isn't constantly under combustion, it had lifters that will open up channels that would be to the exhaust chamber, lifter than closes and opens the intake valve and fills the combustion chamber with fuel and air and then a spark plug will ignite the atomized fuel air mixture","{'rouge1': {'precision': 54.26, 'recall': 18.75, 'fmeasure': 27.87}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 19.35, 'recall': 6.64, 'fmeasure': 9.89}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.98, 'recall': 11.4, 'fmeasure': 16.94}}"

","They are for cigarette lighters. Once upon a time, smoking in the car was common and electronic devices small enough to be powered by a car were science fiction. Cars thus had a device to light your cigarette, so drivers weren't distracted by their Zippo while driving. When electronica came along, the choices were: a) adapt to the cigarette lighter socket; or b) entice car manufacturers to add a different outlet. Making 120VAC house current inside a car is difficult, since cars run on DC, and the cost wasn't optimal. It seems that (a) got the most electronics deployed, so that's what the electronic people did. Over time, too many cigarette lighter to USB gadgets were sold, and cars started having USB ports in them because it's easy to make 5VDC from 12VDC. Some cars have AC outlets, but not anything like the majority. Think of the ""plug"" as a way that two devices state their expectations. The shape of an outlet is saying ""hey I supply power in this way"". Plugs that fit that outlet shape are saying ""okay, I'm designed to work with that"". That way, it prevents you from plugging things into outlets and having potentially disastrous results! A wall outlet is shaped in a certain way that's associated with AC power of a certain voltage and amperage that is common for houses powered by your electrical grid. Cars are powered by an engine doing other stuff and a 12V battery and traditionally have only had to power low voltage, tiny electronics, so they have been designed to supply a different power profile. While cars *can* be made to have regular wall outlets (and some do) it's costly and complicated for minimal gains. They also increasingly have powered USB ports. As for why the port is the shape it is, that seems to date about to cigarette lighters. They were in basically all cars and needed power anyways, so their functionality duplicated as a power plug. Then as lighters became less common, that part was removed and now they're just power ports. A couple of reasons -- backwards compatibility with items that were made to work with the accessory ports, especially back when they were still cigarette lighters. The other is because it delivers DC power. You would not put an AC outlet there, because that invites people to plug something in that should not be plugged in and wreck it and possibly the car's electrical system. If they do away with the accessory port completely, it will be replaced by USB ports or something similar.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.45, 'recall': 24.49, 'fmeasure': 34.85}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.09, 'recall': 3.67, 'fmeasure': 5.23}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.12, 'recall': 10.98, 'fmeasure': 15.64}}"

Reduced noise - if you start both engines at once, the noise from the engines would be much louder than starting one at a time. 4.

So the more distant objects we see the higher speed they have away from us. Which means they will be more red shifted. The problem is that some of the most interesting objects to look at is so far away that they go far into the infrared spectrum. The atmosphere is transparent to visible light but not to all infrared light. And similarly with the main mirror of Hubble which is better for infrared astronomy then earth based telescopes but is still not the best for this and have a relatively small diameter compared to modern telescopes. So the JWST is designed from ground up to be an infrared telescope which can see parts of the spectrum which is not visible though the atmosphere or with Hubble. And the main mirror is much larger then Hubble so it can collect more light and get better resolution images. So JWST is able to look at objects further away then we currently can and in a better resolution. The objects further away is very important to find out the structure of the universe since the light from these objects have been moving for a very long time. A lot of these objects are from the time when the earliest galaxies were formed or even before any galaxies existed. So being able to look at how our universe looked like not long after it was formed may help us understand how it was formed. There is also a secondary objective in observing rouge planets and brown/black dwarf stars in our galaxy. These are also emitting light in the infrared spectrum and can be very hard to observe using existing telescopes.

why do older cars jolt a bit forward or backward after being put in PARK?," & #x200B; 🚗💭🔥👀💤🚨🔎👀💭🚗 I've always wondered this too. I think it's because the transmission is still trying to ""wake up"" or ""engage"" even when the car is in park. It's like when you wake up from a nap, you need a moment to wake up and get moving again. I've heard that it's a safety feature to prevent the car from rolling away when it's in park.","Putting the trans in park just inserts a locking pin. The car jerks because it's the weight of the vehicle taking the slack out of the drive-train until the locking pin bear the weight of the vehicle. I've seen this pin break 4 times, and I live in the flat Midwest. It can happen to you. When that happens, nothing is holding the car in place. My father had a truck like this. We'd park it in one spot and find it across the parking lot when we came back to it. This is why you should always ALWAYS use the parking brake. It *IS NOT* the emergency brake - it's a mechanical brake on your back tires that is meant to bear the weight of the vehicle and keep it in place. It'll also keep your locking pin from breaking. It is utterly useless in an emergency as your front wheels do 80% of your braking, typically more. If your brakes fail and you need to stop, this will just lock up your back tires and put you into an oversteering skid. Now you have two problems. In my understanding, putting the car in park locks the transmission but does nothing to the wheels directly. So when you park the car and let off the brakes, it lurches as the mechanical ""slack"" comes out of the drive train. That is, the wheels can move a bit before being stopped by the locked transmission. You can avoid this by applying the parking brake before releasing the brakes, as this locks the wheels directly.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.75, 'recall': 15.3, 'fmeasure': 24.19}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.14, 'recall': 4.49, 'fmeasure': 7.12}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.8, 'recall': 8.96, 'fmeasure': 14.16}}"
"What's the difference between an airplane and a jet, regarding hardware and such?","> What's the difference between an airplane and a jet, regarding hardware and such?

The main difference between a propeller and a jet is the type of engine used. A propeller is powered by a propeller engine which is connected to the propeller via a shaft. A jet engine is powered by a jet engine which is connected to the wing via a fan. The propeller engine is typically a piston engine, meaning it has a cylinder with a piston that moves up and down inside it. The piston moves a crankshaft which is connected to a propeller. The jet engine is a gas turbine engine. The engine is powered by a gas turbine which is connected to a fan. The fan pulls in air and compresses it. The compressed air is then ignited and burns. This process produces hot gases which then exit the engine and turn the turbine. The turbine is connected to the fan and the fan is connected to the wing. The fan pulls the wing up and down, creating lift.","For an airplane to be a jet it must have a [jet engine]( URL_0 ). Not all airplanes do. For example, a prop plane: A plane where the forward motion is created by propeller engines is not a jet. An ELI5 explanation of how A jet engine works: Air is pulled into the engine by fan blades. This smooshes the air together. Fuel is sprayed into this compressed air and lit on fire. The resulting explosion forces air out the back of the engine very fast, creating forward thrust. A plane is any type of fixed wing aircraft. A jet is a subset of a plane, which uses a jet engine (creates thrust by jet propulsion). A jet is an aircraft that uses the force of ignited fuel-air mix for propulsion. Airplane is a general term for a flying vehicle.

"When and why did they switch from making planes covered with canvas, to making an all metal plane?","> What was the reason for the switch from canvas to metal? The reason for the switch from canvas to metal was due to the need for a more durable material that could withstand the harsh conditions of flying. Canvas was not strong enough to withstand the stresses of flying, and it was also not very durable. It was prone to tears, and it would not hold up well in the heat of the sun. > Why did it take so long for them to switch? The switch from canvas to metal was a gradual process that took place over a period of several decades. The first metal airplanes were made in the early 1900s, but they were not very practical for use in commercial aviation. It wasn’t until the 1920s and 1930s that metal became more practical for use in airplanes. > What was the advantage of metal? Metal was stronger than canvas, and it was also more durable. It was also less prone to tears and damage from the stresses of flying. Metal also allowed for more precise construction, which made for a more stable and reliable airplane. > How did the switch from canvas to metal impact the industry? The switch from canvas to metal was a major factor in the growth of commercial aviation.  ","Around 1900, the Hall–Héroult process allowed for cheap production of aluminum and the development of Al-Cu alloys made all-metal airframes possible. The high-strength Duralumin alloys (Al-Cu), what we now call the 2000-series aluminum, were developed in 1909, and got improved until Alcoa came out with the 2024-T3 alloy (T3 being the heat treatment) in 1931, which we still use a lot of today. Wood worked well for the lightweight, underpowered aircraft of the day with the box-girder frame construction, and wire-truss, strut-supported wing. Where metal really shined was in the monocoque fuselage and fully cantilevered wing. In the older fabric skin planes, the fabric didn't take much of the load, so it added weight without adding strength. In the monocoque planes, the skin provides most of the stiffness. The cantilevered wing got rid of the cables and struts that provided strength to the old aircraft, but required a very strong main spar. So, as planes got bigger engines, and carried more payload, aluminum provided a lighter, stronger solution. Experimentation with all-metal aircraft started in World War I, with Junkers being one of the leading pioneers with their J1 and later F.13. However, the control surfaces on many aircraft continued to be fabric covered right into World War II.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 32.09, 'recall': 31.08, 'fmeasure': 31.58}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.74, 'recall': 3.62, 'fmeasure': 3.68}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.81, 'recall': 15.32, 'fmeasure': 15.56}}"

How does the ISS filter the C02 astronauts exhale back into oxygen?,"The ISS doesn't filter the CO2. It just doesn't have enough air to breathe. The atmosphere on the ISS is about 1/3 the pressure of Earth's atmosphere, so you can't breathe it. The astronauts have to wear pressurized suits to survive. The CO2 is removed from the air by a chemical process called scrubbing. They have a machine that absorbs the CO2 with a chemical called calcium hydroxide. Then the CO2 is released into space.","The ISS uses a system called the ""Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly"", which is a set of filters and other equipment that uses chemical absorption to remove CO2 from the air, then heats it and captures the trapped CO2 to be pumped out.

Recently a whale was found with its stomach full of plastic bags. How does a plastic bag get from my house and into the ocean?,"You can't see plastic microbeads in the ocean, but you can see them in the water. They are very small, and they get into the ocean through storm drains, and can be in the water from there on out. Plastic microbeads are small enough to be ingested by small fish, which can then get eaten by larger fish, and so on. If you're concerned about plastic microbeads in the ocean, you can use cosmetics that don't contain them. They are not a health hazard, but they are a hazard to the environment. Microbeads are found in some cosmetics, such as face wash, toothpaste, and makeup. They are used as exfoliators, and they are also used in some skin care products, such as moisturizers. If you want to avoid microbeads in your cosmetics, look for products that say ""microbead free"" on the label.

The material (wood, steel, concrete, aluminum, masonry, plastic, etc) has a certain strength properties. Each material has a certain allowable stress (force per unit area) before failure (I.e. yielding, or permanent deformation). Also each material has stiffness properties, meaning the amount a material deflects with an applied load (called Young's modulus). This is important to know how something physically reacts under load, but more specifically is mainly used to establish buckling limits for a material, which is a different type of potential failure. The geometry is also important. For columns, the main variable is the cross sectional area of the component itself. Next is the length of the column. Next is the nature of the degree of restraint of the ends of the column (ends that are held rigidly are stronger to resist buckling than ends that are loosely held). Also of importance is the shape of the cross section of the column, the shape will dictate a property called the radius of gyration which will affect the amount of load a column can withstand before buckling. Also, the nature of the load is important to define. Loads can be applied in 6 different ways, axially (which is what I think you're wondering about), but also laterally in two directions (shear), and flexurally in three directions (bi-axial bending and torsion). All of these loads are combined to consider if the column is appropriate. Finally, most engineers use national design codes and standards given all the information above to establish the 'safe load'. As an aside, triangles are an important shape in structures (triangles in 2-dimensions, and tetrahedrons in 3-dimensions). These shapes efficiently transfer load by minimizing bending loads in a structure which will significantly reduce the strength of a component. Hence the more triangle in your structure the better. You had a good intuition regarding the presence of triangles.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 41.27, 'recall': 7.54, 'fmeasure': 12.75}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.68, 'recall': 1.74, 'fmeasure': 2.96}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.33, 'recall': 6.09, 'fmeasure': 10.29}}"

During space travel how do we navigate? North South East and West doesnt work once we are off earth..,"How do we know where we are?
 We use a variety of methods. Inertial navigation uses sensors to measure the rotation of the spacecraft. If you have a clock and a compass, you can use that to figure out which direction you are going. If you have a gyroscope, you can use that to figure out how fast you are rotating. And if you have a GPS, you can use that to figure out where you are. GPS uses satellites orbiting the Earth to measure your position. The satellites are constantly moving, so if you know where they are, you can figure out where you are. But if you don't know where they are, you can use them to figure out where you are. In space, the stars are also constantly moving. So if you know where they are, you can figure out where you are. That's why astronauts use stars to navigate. It's also why they don't use the sun. The sun is always moving, so it's hard to figure out which way it's pointing. So they use the stars instead. There are a lot of other ways to navigate in space too. One of the most famous is the ""sextant"". It's a little instrument that you can use to measure the angle between two things. It's like a telescope that can measure the angle between two points.

There are multiple radar ground stations around the earth that can track objects in orbit around the Earth. There are also more sophisticated ground stations that can track objects further into our solar system, which are usually used by NASA to track the probes they send out. The ground stations then use an antenna to send out an electromagnetic wave to ping an object. The object, presumably a shuttle or something will send back the signal to the ground station with various amounts of data. Then people crunch the data and figure out where this object is based on multiple factors like distance, time traveled, angles, etc. I could throw out some bigger terms, but then it would be closer to a ELI10","{'rouge1': {'precision': 24.89, 'recall': 36.88, 'fmeasure': 29.72}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.97, 'recall': 4.4, 'fmeasure': 3.54}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.5, 'recall': 20.0, 'fmeasure': 16.12}}"
How the mathematical imaginary components to circuits (Sinusoidal current and voltage as well as impedance) are applied to the real world.,"Imagine you have a 2000 mph train that is traveling from point A to point B. The train is traveling in a straight line. Now imagine that you have a 1000 mph train that is traveling from point C to point D. The two trains are moving in the same direction and are 1000 miles away from each other. If you were to measure the speed of the two trains, you would find that the speed of the 2000 mph train is 2000 mph, and the speed of the 1000 mph train is 1000 mph. However, the total speed of the two trains is 3000 mph. The imaginary component is like the 1000 mph train. It is traveling in the same direction as the 2000 mph train, but it is traveling at a different speed. The imaginary component can be used to represent a 2000 mph train that is traveling in a different direction. The total speed of the two trains is 3000 mph.","The imaginary component shows up in the degree to which voltage lags current or vice versa. In a DC circuit, if you increase the voltage, the current also increases at the same time. However in an AC circuit, as the signal reaches peak voltage, it may not yet be at peak current. You might have to wait another 1/4 of a cycle to reach peak current, for example, at which point voltage has decreased. The imaginary component describes this difference. So what you must realise is that imaginary components are just that, imaginary. They don't exist. What they do is allow you to represent a one-dimensional system using 2 dimensions. Why would you ever want to do that? Well, because it makes your maths easier. A waveform can now be described as a circle, and a phase is an angle. You do your math, then throw away the entire imaginary axis and look at the results on the real axis, and it all works out. If you are interested, you can further look at quaternions.

"How come my car tells me when my oil is too low, but there's no gauge on my dashboard to indicate how much is in there all the time?","'I'm glad you're asking that question, but I'm not sure you really want to know the answer. You see, the reason your car tells you when your oil is too low is because the oil level is monitored by a sensor that is connected to the engine computer. When the sensor detects that the oil level is too low, it sends a signal to the engine computer, which then sends a signal to the dashboard to display the message. This is a very convenient feature, as it allows you to monitor your oil level without having to look at the oil dipstick every time you fill up your car. However, it's important to note that the dashboard gauge is not an accurate measure of your oil level. This is because the dashboard gauge is only an approximation of your oil level, and it can be off by a few percentage points. This is because the gauge is connected to a mechanical mechanism that can become worn out over time, causing the gauge to be inaccurate. In addition, the gauge can also be affected by the temperature of the engine, as well as other factors. For these reasons, it's important to check the oil level regularly using the dipstick, and to always use the correct type of oil for your car. This will ensure that your engine is properly lubricated and running smoothly, and that your dashboard gauge is giving you an accurate reading.","Unlike gas, your car isn't designed to burn through oil. Putting a gauge on the dashboard that *shouldn't ever move* is just adding cost & clutter to the instrument panel. You've already got an easy way to check your oil levels - the dipstick in your engine compartment. Check it every time you buy gas if you're worried about your oil levels. If there were gauges and indicators for everything that should be monitored by the driver, your car's dashboard would be more complicated than the inside of a Boeing 747. The ""check engine"" light is connected to a computer in most vehicles built from the 90s forward that illuminates the light when any one of these hundred or so problems happens. You, the driver, can then attach a device that will read out the error codes, telling you what is wrong. This requires less space -- only a handheld device and a booklet is needed, rather than a hundred pounds of gauges and equipment. Only the most critical thing that will cause *immediate* engine destruction is monitored: The coolant temperature. Everything else may destroy your car... but it'll probably take time. Your oil should be checked weekly to monthly depending on its age, and it's there in the owner's manual for this reason. Also -- heavy duty trucks and semis *do* have oil pressure gauges, because low oil is similarly instantly destructive. A regular automobile will (usually) give warnings of low oil before it dies -- squeaking, grinding, excessive heat (coolant temp), poor acceleration, stalling, difficulty starting. These are all signs that any motorist should be immediately alarmed about, and the oil should be the first thing checked. tl;dr -- Too complicated, here's a light bulb that blinks.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.77, 'recall': 39.59, 'fmeasure': 42.88}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.72, 'recall': 8.22, 'fmeasure': 8.91}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.35, 'recall': 16.38, 'fmeasure': 17.74}}"

The fact that smoking is illegal doesn't mean that nobody will break the law and smoke.

Why do most light bulbs burn out when the switch is flipped on?,"Because when you flip the switch, it is sending a current through the bulb. When the bulb is turned off, there is no current going through it. The bulb is designed to withstand this current flowing through it, but when the current is turned off, the bulb doesn't have enough power to keep the filament from burning out.","When a light bulb is turned on its filament is cold and so the resistance is low. So a giant rush of current runs through it. As it heats up the resistance goes up and current goes down and eventually reaches a balance. So this rush of current is the most stressful thing that happens to the filament. As the filament weakens from being heated eventually it will burn through the filament. This is most likely to happen during the cold to hot rush of high current. remember how when things get hot, they get bigger? and that bending metal back and forth will cause it to break? and that the faster and further you bend it, the quicker it breaks? and that glowing hot metal is pretty weak? so when you first turn a light on, the filament, that little metal spring or wire thing inside the bulb that gets hot and glows....gets really hot *very, very* quickly...and therefore bends a bit because it got bigger because it got hot, and it got softer, because it got hot, and it did this quickly, as you can see the light nearly instantly. so after a bunch of times of getting hot very quickly and cooling down slowly, the filament snaps, just like any other metal bent back and forth a lot. there's one other thing happening here: because lightbulbs aren't perfect, there's some extra, unwanted, stuff inside...stuff like oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon that's nearly impossible to get completely rid of. when chemicals are hot, they usually react faster...and the lightbulb gets pretty hot....and those unwanted things, the oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, react with the metal filament and cause it to get more brittle over time, thus exacerbating the whole process.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 62.71, 'recall': 12.37, 'fmeasure': 20.67}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.52, 'recall': 3.02, 'fmeasure': 5.06}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 38.98, 'recall': 7.69, 'fmeasure': 12.85}}"

They're the fins.","Some of these answers are not entirely correct, the rocket's center of drag pressure still has to be behind it's center of mass or no gimbal is going to keep you straight. So it's not just that you can add gimbals and remove fins. Fins serve two purposes, they steer the rocket and they stabilize it by providing some drag pressure towards the rear. A rocket must already be stable for it to fly with a gimbal, the gimbal is for course corrections. Space X's rocket is designed to have completely different centers of drag and centers of mass when it goes up and goes down, so just removing the mass of the upper stage needs to be sufficient to change it from being stable forwards to stable backwards. That small kink before the engines for example moves the center of drag much farther backwards when flying backwards, and even with gimballed engines and powerful nitrogen thrusters the Falcon 9 needs to deploy fins at the top of the rocket to properly be stable coming down. So it really does require careful aerodynamic design and mass balancing to be able to remove the fins as they don't just steer, they aerodynamically balance the rocket. Verneire style and nitrogen thrusters are also an important modern rocket steering technology. Fins weigh a decent amount so being able to get rid of them, is a huge boost to performance. The benefit of removing fins of course is less drag and weight.

Why are we encouraged to have good posture but then car and airplane seats are shaped in such a way that they do the opposite?,"Posture is a thing that we are taught as children, and is a habit that we have to maintain for our entire lives.

We are used to being upright, and that is what we should be doing. It is also important to note that we are not used to being in a position where we are not able to move around.

Why do toilets not have an overflow secondary drain as sinks do?,"Because toilets are designed to handle liquid and solid waste, and toilets are designed to handle more liquid than solid waste. The overflow is designed to help prevent the toilet from overflowing when the toilet is being flushed. The overflow is not designed to handle the liquid that would otherwise overflow from the toilet.","There's still just one drain for a sink. The overflow is just getting water to the route it would if the drain wasn't plugged. For a toilet, if the drain is plugged the flow of water is going to be stopped (or slowed) entirely. An overflow drain would end up just as backed up. Apparently, overflow-proof toilets already exist. [Sauce]( URL_0 ). As a justification, sinks and bathtubs are designed to be plugged purposefully, and the overflow drain prevents this intentional blockage from causing a mess. In contrast, a toilet is not designed to be intentionally plugged. EDIT: There's also already an overflow-sensing shutoff system. [Sores]( URL_1 ) This is a good question.... A secondary pipe that is ran alongside the main toilet drain or even molded onto the side of the entire pipe would solve this issue. Problem is if toilet paper were to get into the smaller overflow drain unclogging that might be a bit harder. But having a backup would be the best thing... Source? My child flooded my fucking bathroom tonight...... Toilets are different than sinks in that they have an integral trap in them. You can usually see how what you flush has to go up and then down the drain. Having an overflow for a toilet would bypass this trap, and nasty sewer gas would come out all the time. Sinks have a separate trap installed underneath them. The overflow uses the same piping as the main drain, but is really only meant to be used if the stopper gets left in accidentally.

How are modern buildings designed to be earthquake-resistant?,"Modern buildings are designed to be earthquake-resistant in the same way that they are designed to be hurricane-resistant. They are designed to withstand forces that would normally be too strong for the building to resist, and they are designed to be able to return to their original shape after the forces are removed. The way this is done is by using materials that are strong enough to resist the forces that are applied to them, and by designing the building to be able to absorb the forces. This is done by using materials that are flexible and strong, and by designing the building to be able to flex and move in response to the forces that are applied to it. For example, buildings are often designed with flexible walls and floors, and with roofs that are designed to be able to flex and move. This allows the building to absorb the forces of the earthquake, and to return to its original shape after the forces are removed. The building is also designed to be able to withstand the forces of the earthquake, and to be able to continue to operate after the forces are removed. This is done by using materials that are strong enough to resist the forces, and by designing the building to be able to continue to operate even when the forces are applied.  ","I work for a structural steel construction company, and this is something I've only been told by word of ear, haven't seen it in person. For large skyscraper type buildings, the very top of it will be some kind of atrium with a large concrete ball hanging from the top. So as the building moves, the ball will move in the opposite direction, keeping the building in the same place. Wish I could provide more info but I'm drunk and about to smash some Denny's Edit: am I the only one being upvoted because I'm smashing dennys? Hello, structural engineer here. I do seismic design on the west coast (high earthquake risk). First of all we have to pick a level of earthquake to design for. Generally the building codes specify an earthquake that has a 1 in 2500 year chance of occurring (smaller earthquakes will happen more often than this). This means that for a 50 year structure life, there is a 2% chance of the earthquake being bigger than what the structure was designed for. This doesnt necessarily mean that the structure will fail though. We generally allow for a certain amount of damage to occur in the design earthquake but for it to only occur in controlled locations (ie. no progressive collapse and ductile failure). We allow steel to yield (permanently deform) a certain amount, and reinforced concrete to crack. We do a structural analysis to see how the structure behaves in an earthquake. The most important thing is the period or frequency of vibration of the structure. You get resonance and higher forces on the building if it vibrates at a similar frequency to the earthquake shaking. For simple buildings you can do this on paper by hand; for more complicated structures you have to use a 3D computer model. After the structural analysis, the engineer will have an idea of the forces on the structure due to an earthquake. They would design selected critical parts of the structure to take that force and detail it to ensure it doesn't fail (lose all of its load carrying capacity) even if it becomes damaged. Damage to the structure helps to dissipate the earthquake energy and act as a fuse to limit the loads on other parts of the structure. Then you design the rest of the structure to make sure it is stronger than those critical areas you identified and designed earlier. This is the basic method of design, for more complicated structures such as highrises and long bridges engineers would use special techniques such as dampers (sloshing water tanks at the top of a high rise) or base isolation (special bearings at the base of the structure to allow it to partly move with the earthquake rather than withstand the force from trying to stay in place). TLDR: Engineers design and detail certain parts to be damaged but not fail or collapse. The rest of the structure has to be stronger than that. EDIT: Here is a 12 page pdf from the Structural Engineers Association of BC which does a pretty decent (better than me) job at outlining structural engineering for earthquakes in layman terms. URL_0 Am architect. There are multiple ways, and each building is different. With an earthquake, what you want your building to do, is to absorb as little of the energy/waves as possible, and to expel any with as little damage as possible. One way, for example, is not to have basements, less mass for the building to absorb energy. Another is to loosen up the steel connections in the structure, so that the energy won't transfer as much thought out the building. Steel, btw, is ductile, meaning that, to an extent, it's flexible and will return to its original position and strength after bending (ie expel energy). There will also be things like expansion joints where energy can be released. One weird example is when they might build a large concrete bathtub in the ground, and then build the building in that, so that the building has no real connection to the ground itself, limiting the energy absorption in the actual building. In general, you'll never make a building stronger than an earthquake, but you can try to tune it, so the energy absorption is less (avoid resonance with an expected earthquake frequency) . And then tune it so that the energy is expelled in controlled and safe places You know how a house of cards has strength vertically, meaning you can stack multiple layers on top of each other but if you introduce any vibration or wind they collapse. That happens because they don't have lateral resistance or ""shear value"". If you take a cardboard box that is still flat and has not been folded into box form, you can push the corners together and it will squeeze together easy right? So now if you fold the box and flaps together and try to squeeze it there is resistance to it deforming. If you take six cards and tape them to each other forming a cube, you get the same resistance to deformation. This can be achieved with plywood ""cards"" nailed to the structure, metal frames, or metal X shaped structures within a square attaching at the corners. ELI9 Earthquakes, along with wind, apply a horizontal load or shear force to the building. Buildings are designed against shear force by different methods, most commonly with the use of shear walls and cross bracing, which keeps the building stiff. Another design method that has been used is to build the building like a tube structure where the building is modeled as a cantilevered structure; in this type of building, the exterior walls act as the shear walls. Short answer: computers. Hi, I was part of the structural engineering team that designed the Benguela Belize compliant tower. It's underwater, but far taller than a skyscraper. You can read about it here (pretty weak article, really) [here]( URL_0 ) The principles are similar, though. Very tall structures have frequencies, and there is a structural engineering science called ""harmonics."" Every structure has several natural frequencies, called modes. These are determined through advanced computer modeling. It's strange to think of building moving in waves, but it's what they do. Small changes to joint designs, material usage, angles, etc, can have dramatic impacts on the modes. To make a complicated thing more basic, the dampers many have mentioned can be controlled, and can affect the modes of a building. Earthquakes apply forces, the dampers counter the forces to put the building's vibrations into harmony, vs conflict, with the earthquake's forces. It's not just the dampers- the entire building is designed with these scenarios in mind. Structural engineers apply a process called LRFD (load and resistance factor design) to determine whether the building can stand up to different scenarios. If you've ever been to a beach, it is kind of like the difference between when you jump at the right time to float over the top of a wave vs when you miss time it and the wave punches you in the gut. I'm finding it difficult to find a place to cut this off.... Thought you might want some info om how they make old buildings earthquake resistant. I spent some time in the SF Bay Area and learned a few things about it. It's basically making the building stronger and more flexible. They call it ""retrofitting"". It varies by building but basically involves reinforcing the structure with things like beams and making it flexible. They way they do that with brick walls, for example, is coating the inside with fiberglass so the walls can move but remain intact. There are a series of methods, but the main key to making a building earthquake resistant is allowing it to be able to move a little. If it can't, then when an earthquake happens, it is violently shaken and usually snaps kind of like a toothpick. A common method used is called base isolation. One of the projects that I've been working on in my construction management job uses this method. What it basically is is a series of rubber/steel pads between the tops of the basement columns and the first floor slab. They allow the building to move a little, which helps to dissipate any motion derived from an earthquake. This article helps explain it well: URL_0 Structural engineer checking in. I work and consult in Southern California, which is one of the most seismically relevant areas in the USA. Please do not receive any of what I'm writing in any official capacity beyond the intent of the question. The quick and dirty version is that earthquakes impose a specific type of load or stress upon a building, and that building needs to react to that load in such a manner that would allow it to displace, or bend, in a ductile manner. We have studied earthquakes for decades,and have written a building code that is pretty good at balancing the need for earthquake-resistant practices in building design and construction against the cost of designing and building such ""super"" buildings. Note that seismic design is not a finished or complete science. There is still much work to be done, mostly on the public and policy side, to improve and perfect our current system. At the end of the day, the citizens pay the city in the form of taxes for how ""safe"" their buildings are. Earthquakes primarily cause ground acceleration in the x-y plane, with a little bit in the z direction. We measure a building's response to the ground acceleration and call it ""drift."" Obviously we want to minimize drift. Check out the UCSD shake table test for reference. So buildings end up shaken a whole bunch sideways, and a little bit up-and-down. This means that our structure needs to resist these sideways motions (since forces cause motions...a bastardization of Newtons first law). Our structure can resist loads by being 1) stiff and rigid, or 2) bendy and ductile. Traditionally, stiffness gives us strength. There is a trade off, however. High stiffness usually means low ductility and vice versa. It is difficult to design for both. Stiffness really sucks when it comes to handling accelerations. Imagine if your car did not crumple during a head-on collision. You would be turned into mashed potatoes. Since we have established that earthquakes cause ground acceleration, which will induce lateral movement in our building, we need the building to insulate the occupants from this motion without also collapsing due to the high stress. What we have come up with to solve this problem are ductile design provisions that incorporate something called a ""lateral force resisting system."" This can be anything from a semi-rigid diaphragm, to a tuned mass damper, to hydraulic bracing, to shear walls with built-in ductility. The whole point is that we want our structure to bend without breaking. If our building is allowed to bend, then it can dissipate some of the earthquake's energy into the parts and pieces that are bending but not breaking. If we do experience a failure, it is better to see a ductile failure than a catastrophically brittle failure. Ductile elements typically fail after much bending and energy dissipation has occurred, allowing other systems that depend on the failing element to pick up the slack. California Engineer here (PE): modern buildings resit earthquakes in multiple ways from shear walls, lateral bracing to stiff moment frames. The general theory is the building will move and we (as engineers) try and limit the movement​ by dissipating the energy of the earthquake. The dissipation is done through many ways. Some could be base isolation where we isolate the base structure from the subgrade and limit the amount of energy transfer into the building. Others include allowing some amount of ""yielding"" or damage in the beams to dissipate energy. This ""damage"" isn't damage in the sense that it will cause the building to collapse but can be acceptable yielding in the steel or concrete reinforcing. Here in the US we lean toward more ""flexible"" structures that move with the earthquake and just ensure that the building can handle the movement. In Japan, however, (and someone can correct me if I'm wrong) they have gone down the path of making their structures super stiff and allowing very little movement. Both have pros and cons and both have proved to work. One of the sad truths in our field is we only really gain great knowledge of the behavior of earthquake resistant structures after an event and studying the failures. tl/dr: we allow some damage but don't worry it won't fall... [Taipei 101]( URL_0 ) is a tall building in an extremely earthquake prone region of Taiwan. They use a [tuned mass damper]( URL_1 ) which is meant to reduce the amplitude of mechanical vibrations and in turn reduce structural failure. [edit] fixed links and formatting Along with being somewhat flexible, tall buildings may have a [tuned mass damper]( URL_0 ) - essentially a giant weight hanging in the center of the building that reduces vibration. Here's a video of a tuned mass damper during an earthquake: URL_1 Currently working in Christchurch New Zealand which was pretty much levelled in the 2011 earthquakes. City is still a demolition site due to the new requirements for buildings to be earthquake proof, so development is slow. In short, fuck loads of steel reinforcement and rubber expansion joints. One thing I don't see covered here, is that buildings used to be designed so they didn't fall down and kill people. That was considered an earthquake proof building. After a big quake a badly damaged building would be demolished and rebuilt. After the Christchurch earthquake in particular, which cost $42bln when most of the CBD ended up being needing to be demolished, much more emphasis is now on designing buildings that can be repaired. One way to do this, is bits of the building are often designed to fail, absorbing energy in their destruction (like in cars), these bits are then repaired or replaced without having to demolish the building. I work at a structural engineering firm in San Francisco and these are the kinds of questions I love to see. I'm ELI5 terms, modern buildings are designed to be earthquake-resistant by making sure that specific parts of the building bend without breaking in even the under the strongest earthquakes. This is possible by using materials (such as steel) that can be bent and stretched without losing much strength. When you use the right materials in the right parts of the structure, the design doesn't have to be perfect to be able to withstand an earthquake. For some ELI10 add ons, buildings aren't meant to look ""good as new"" after a major earthquake. Typical buildings are designed to prevent collapse and ensure that people are not trapped after the shaking stops. Many times a building will be properly designed and have to be torn down after a large-magnitude earthquake. I work for a general contractor in California building hospitals so seismic design basically runs our lives. I would say one of the more prevelant designs is to use a system called base isolation. Imagine a building resting on these ""pucks"" in between plates. Every place where a column goes down to where the foundation would be, you have this base isolator. During a seismic event, the earth will be moving around but due to the pucks the building will be stationary since it can slide independently of the earth. There are other systems as well.y current project has viscous wall dampers which makes it unique because it is the only hospital in the country with such a seismic design. Civil engineer here. If you ask how do we simulate the action of an earthquake on a building, there are many ways. The most common two would be: 1. We use a set of static loads applied laterally on each floor of the building. This is the static approach. 2. We use recording of previous earthquakes in the area to simulate a real earthquake on the building. This is the dinamic approach. If you ask how do we make buildings not collapse during earthquakes: 1. In case of low rise buildings (maximum 6-10 floors) we use the concept of plastic hinge. Basically we consider that plastic hinges appear in specific locations on the element of the structure, and that they dissipate seismic energy by converting it into heat energy. This is just like when you bend a cheap piece of plastic and it whitens. That white part would be the plastic hinge, and you would be the seismic action. Now just scale it up to the size of beams, columns, walls and you'll get the point. 2. In the case of high rise buildings damping sistems are used. Imagine that you are on a swing and you want to stop. What do you do? That is was damping sistems do to the whole building. This is way too advanced to explain it in a Reddit post with you having any Dinamics of structures background. 3. In the case of high rise buildings there is also another solution, base isolation sistems. Basically you put the building on rollers or ""springs"" and the ground can move freely bellow it. This is a though and complex question you have here. Hope this helps. ^_^ One of the systems is an isolation system. My office building has this. It basically sits on a sort of ball bearing and spring set up, such that the ground can move around it and it doesn't move as much. At least, that's what the building people told me. I've experienced an earthquake in it, and it was a very interesting sensation. When I felt an earthquake at home (a shortish, solid concrete apartment building) it was like I was laying on a giant washing machine. (I was sleeping at the time) When I felt it in the modern office building on the 24th floor, it felt like being on a boat. if you're looking for an interesting, an very well designed example, check out the Sendai Mediateque by Toyo Ito! it survived, with only cosmetic damage, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake. here's a link to a video of it during said earthquake: URL_0 . In Wellington, New Zealand, there's a museum called Te Papa and you can walk underground and see these big rubber and lead slabs that hold up the building and somehow help with earthquakes. You'll have to go there and read all the sciencey stuff if you wanna better explanation If someone can ELI5 some Japanese buildings, I'd be very appreciative. When I travelled there I was told that some of the buildings were essentially absolutely safe as they were conjoined to absorb the pressure and act as a transmitter of force from one to the other and back, which seemed to make sense to a layman. In a place so prone to earthquakes, I did wonder how the bigger buildings would fare in a particularly powerful earthquake, can you ever completely do away with the risk it could collapse? There are two big ways this is done: 1. Tuned Mass Dampers: Basically a big heavy lump held up near the top of the tower to absorb the energy of a swaying building. 2. Somewhat flexible mounting points in the foundation that let the earth move slightly without taking the building with it. These are often something like a big ball bearing in a shallow bowl (so when you shake the bowl the building stays in place), or rubber foundations that insulate vibrations. Exactly what you use largely depends on how tall the building is. Geologist opinion checking in. I commonly use this USGS resource to find the peak ground acceleration (PGA) of an area. Whenever designing walls, ya gotta account for seismic conditions as well. URL_0 PGA is very dependent on the material density, moisture, shear strength, and grain size of the subgrade that the building is on. If the building is built on till, or bed rock, you don't have much to worry about. If it consists primarily of wet sands, peat, or fill than you have an issue! Lots of ways to improve the subgrade in this case, auger cast piles, pin piles, overexcavation then bridging with structural material. Since I don't think it's really been mentioned here I'll throw in what I ""know"". Most people responding here are giving very technical explanations but not a lot of variety in examples, so I'll give mine. I recently saw a documentary on tv, probably PBS or something like that, about a guy who visited places after major earthquakes to survey the damage of the quakes as well as collect data on the buildings that survived. One of the most fascinating design elements that worked better than most other designs the guy looked at was the inclusion of wooden beams into the walls and structure of buildings in old buildings in the Nepal area. The wood provided flexibility and allowed for compression in the buildings during an earthquake. The guy collecting the data found a several hundred year old temple built in this method that survived the large quakes in the last few years with only very minor cosmetic damage but was overall largely un-effected. I do realize that many other comments talk about this use of flexibility but I didn't see many in historic context with examples. LOTS OF WAYS! am future architect. One is to resist the energy. Use of diagonal braces, strengthened rebar and prestressed concrete beams often make it eaiser for the building to keep its shape in mild earthquakes. Another way is to absorb some of the energy. There are cross tension wires, which allow some of the building to flex without it pulling apart too much, there is tuned dampers, which are basically big weights of metal, water, or other materials that resist momentum, and allow the building to keep a center of gravity. Another ways is to have giant ball bearing on the foundations, the bottom of the foundation is a giant bowl, and then end of the building collumns are giant balls, and they sit together, and in an earthquake, they slide around a bit, but never come out. It allows the building to stay in one place eaiser than footings connceted right to the ground. And lastly one way is to mitigate the shockwave of an earthquake entirely. Earthquakes are energy waves, and by channeling the energy into something other than the ground or buildings, they can divert the energy AROUND the buildings or even cities. Many buildings in SAN FRAN and around there have giant steel bands in a circle AROUND the building, allowing the earthquake energy to be absorbed INTO the bands, around the building, and past it without actually shaking the building. A lot of the answers are taking a professorial/research approach, which is fine for understanding how seismic loads occur and can affect a specific structure, but in real practice, we have pretty straight-forward equations used to calculate structural loads. If you had to write a dissertation every time you wanted to build a building (in addition to all the other documentation we already have to create), it would be a tad time- or cost-prohibitive. So we assume loads are much worse than they really will be and our lack of exactness buys us time and dollar savings. Specifically, there are codes for designing for seismic effects on buildings. The American Society of Civil Engineers provides [Standard 7-05]( URL_0 ), its basic building code book for the United States. Chapter 11 covers seismic, but you'll see there are also guidelines on calculating rain, flood, wind, snow, and other environmental loads. You calculate these separately based on maps that tell you the expected loads in a given geopgraphic area. Live loads (like people, moveable things) and dead loads (like immovable things and the building's self-weight) are also considered. Once you calculate all your loads, you multiply them by a safety factor (1.4 for live loads and 1.2 for dead loads, I don't know about the other ones), you add them up in their respective locations, then use the numbers to choose the size of your joists, beams, columns, foundations, etc. So, while southern California may have seismic, wind, rain (and maybe even flood loads) to calculate, you won't generally have snow loads. New York? Unlikely seismic activity but definitely wind, snow, and rain loads. This is all rather straight forward (even boring) in practice. It's just math based on empiral experience and what the industry has agreed upon over decades of compiling research and data. It gets updated once in a while. And of course there are local and state codes to take into consideration. But ASCE 7-05 is the place all structural engineers in the US start. TL;DR: Maps and math equations. Source: structural engineering degrees [Architecture student]: I cannot provide a detailed answer (I know basic calculus and some physics, but I'm no engineer), but I know the general idea. There are several different way to resist the lateral loads caused by an earthquake,for example: South America uses a rigid system. This is when the building is heavily reinforced through cross/'x' bracing. The building acts as a single member that does not twist or bend, and it is isolated from the ground. So in construction the first thing done is an excavation of the area slightly larger than the footprint of the building and, depending on the height, ~36 feet deep. This is where the lowest concrete slab is poured (also supported by piers or piles) here there is a layer of dampeners (rubber pads) that the building will ultimately sit on. The building is then constructed floor by floor with cross bracing between columns, and near the top a mass dampener (heavy thing) that allows the building to move around it, or computer assisted masses that add and subtract weight from different areas of the building to counteract the horizontal movement (resonance) [See 'A']. In Asia the method differs from South America, and instead of designing a rigid structure to move as a whole, the buildings are designed through a more flexible structure that allowes more movement between the joints of the building. This give the entire building a spring like quality, and as a lateral force is imposed on to a building the structure may slightly twist as to coil or bend as to spring. This is similar to how buildings respond to wind forces. Taipei 101 is a great example of mass dampeners used to resist wind and earthquakes. In California smaller private homes use a denser spacing between studs or hurricane ties . Again I cannot speak to the formulas involved, and I hope my writing isn't terribly confusing. [A] Imagine you are on a train and the train begins to move. You can either pull yourself in the direction of the movement (similar to radio towers or cross bracing in buildings), or you can shift your weight forward to keep from falling back (buildings with mass dampeners). Here’s a story my Dad used to tell me… I’d love some corroboration of this. During WW2, my Dad was in Hong Kong. In the days before the invasion, he had pulled some extra patrol duty in the city. He was partnered with a civilian constable… Dad would arrest any soldiers breaking the law, and the constable would arrest civilians. Dad’s a young guy – about 20, grew up on a farm in Saskachewan (small town prairie Canada). Hadn’t seen many vehicles, planes when he’s a kid before he left the farm. Now he’s in the place that’s like an alien planet. As he’s walking around, he’s noticing something odd. Some shortish apartment buildings (maybe 3 stories) are in small courtyards that are hard packed stone, with short stone walls on the outside. What’s odd is that they aren’t in the centre of the courtyard. His North American eye was struggling with it… the buildings were like they were randomly plunked in the courtyard. Right at the front, at the back, and none were square in the courtyard. He’s trying to figure out if he should bring it up with the constable, and how he would explain his question to someone who spoke somewhat broken English. Then they passed another one, and the building was right up against the short stone wall, and an old lady was struggling to open the front door and crawl over the wall to get into the building. This was too much. He asked the constable why the building was built that way. The constable looked blank, and then told him, ah, I understand. It’s because of earthquakes! The building was built on ball bearings. He took Dad into the courtyard, and showed him. He got on the ground and looked under the building “skirt” and you could see them (just). Massive hand carved stone carved bearings – he figured from what he could see that they were one and a half meters (yards), or more, through. The building was built on top of them. When there was an earthquake, the constable explained, the building bounced around inside the courtyard, but didn’t fall. But the building just wound up where it wound up after the shaking stopped. He was shown a few other buildings as well. Some had round ball bearings, some were on carved log shaped cylinders… they had a tendency to move forward and backwards. The constable said the bearings were very valuable, and would be saved and reused if the building was demolished – some were very old. I’ve always thought that was brilliant. Anyone out there that could confirm this for me? It’s a great story. Structural engineer here and I would like to give my input as I am not happy with the top comments/answers. They do not directly answer the question and also have false statements. For example, mass tuned dampening is one method of helping a tall buildings reduce motion it is not required (e.g. Burj Khalifa does not have one). Also a statements such as buildings not absorbing energy or beams ""failing"" first are incorrect. So let me begin, In a seismic event different waves travel through the ground, P-waves, Shear Waves, L-waves. These waves cause motion in different directions, up and down, side to side, compression and tension etc. The side to side motion is the most damaging so let us focus on that. Imagine a simple ""lollipop"" structure. Single slender column supporting a ball of mass concentrated at the top (think water tower). As the ground shakes the the motion is transferred into the building. The displacement, velocity and acceleration of the mass depends on the stiffness of said structure (effective length, modulus of materials, moment of inertia). If the resonant frequency of the structure matches that of the earthquake that is very bad! You want a resonant frequency that is lower so it ""attracts"" less load. If it is very stiff it will excite just like the ground and forces will be high, F=ma. Think of a building as lollipops stacked on top of each other. Once an engineer determines the amount of force at each story of a building (stiffness matrix x displacement) then they design the seismic force resisting system (SFRS). To resist a lateral force several methods can be used depending on cost, efficiency, architectural requirements etc. Some methods include compression tension braces, moment frames and concrete shear walls. In tall buildings or seismically active regions or post disaster buildings (this is my field of experience, i design hospitals) the forces will be too high to design for. So engineers will instead allow the structure to yield and deform and absorb energy. If there is no yielding there is no energy absorption (think spring that you push and pull in the linear region, it never loses its shape). One can scale down the forces if they allow for more yeiding and energy abortion, but the cost typically goes up, need more concrete confinement, better welded or bolted connections. If the deflections for the tall building is too high then a liquid mass tuned dampener an be used. The mass always moves in the opposite direction of the building. Fun fact Tapei 101 turned theirs into a tourist attraction. The burj khalifa does not even use one ! it is not always necessary. These tall buildings use a techniques like shear walls in a triangular shape (think tripod wth legs deployed far out as possible) or non uniform cross section to ""confuse"" the wind and prevent resonance. If the ground vibrations are too high techniques such as isolation pads can be used, think marbles underneath your houses foundation. Ground shakes but building just sits on top. These are advanced methods that are not common in your average mid rise.

what's the difference between ram air parachutes and the round ones?,"...
I'm not an expert but I'm a parachutist and I'll do my best to explain. The short answer is that the round chutes are better at slowing down the descent of a plane and the ram air chutes are better at slowing down the descent of a person. The long answer is that the round chutes are designed to slow down the descent of a plane and are called ""flaperons"" or ""flaps"" and are used for slowing down the descent of the plane after the pilot has deployed the round chute. The round chutes are made of a material called ""ripstop"" which is a special material that is woven in such a way that it is very strong and resistant to tearing. The round chutes are also made of a very thin material and are designed to inflate very quickly. They are usually made of a very lightweight material like nylon or polyester and are inflated by the wind that passes over the top of the chute. The round chutes are also designed to be very wide and to have a very large surface area so that they can inflate quickly and provide a lot of drag. The round chutes are also designed to be very lightweight so that they can be easily carried by the pilot in a small container. The round chutes are also very easy to use and are designed to be very reliable.  ","You can maneuver a ram air parachute. Ram airs are for stunts and for people who want control after the chute opens. You can traverse a lot of lateral distance if you want. Basically ""fly"" the chute. Experienced jumpers could jump at high altitude from far away and land on a pinpiont that is miles away from the point of opening. Great for covert military ops when you want to surprise whoever is on the ground. The disadvantage is that the ram air is MUCH less stable in flight. It requires constant maneuvering and effort to stay on target. They are less safe. There is a possibility that a novice could lose control of the chute. Round chutes pretty much drop straight down upon release, have little control, and travel wherever the wind decides to take you. The great advantage to a round chute is that they are very stable and much more safe for a novice jumper, such as paratroopers in WW2 that had little if any time to practice jumping. Round chutes are also great for dead-weight cargo drops and slowing decents of spacecraft or aircraft on short runways. Greater chance of breaking a leg on landing w/ a round parachute due to less control of rate of descent.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 34.17, 'recall': 38.68, 'fmeasure': 36.28}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.37, 'recall': 9.48, 'fmeasure': 8.89}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.92, 'recall': 20.28, 'fmeasure': 19.03}}"

You need to balance a whole bunch of factors to get a solution that meets the result. In engines, there's a whole bunch of factors, but for most purposes, you can focus on these: 1. An engine needs to make sufficient power to move the vehicle 2. An engine needs to balance out all the vibrations inherent in the spinning and shaking that's going on. If you don't manage this, eventually the engine shakes itself apart. 3. The engine needs to fit inside the vehicle (and, for performance applications, be located in a way that maximizes the handling characteristics of the car). 4. The engine needs to consume only so much fuel. A V8 engine handles all 4 of these in a nicely balanced way: its not really good at any one of the 4, but its 'good enough' to make it one of the best overall engine layouts. It also sounds sexy as hell. ----- The cylinder configuration of an engine has effects on two major factors, the smoothness / vibration, and the 'packaging' or sizing / shape / how it fits in the car. Cylinder count has nothing to do with power, typically - that has to do with displacement, flow of the heads, shape of the combustion chamber, cylinder pressure, compression, ignition timing, and a ton of other factors. Up until 2013, F1 used 2.4L engines that were V8s, a size commonly set up as an I4 in commercial vehicles. V8s come in two major flavors; flat plane and cross plane cranks, which describe how the pistons connect to the crankshaft. Cross plane V8s (where if you look edge-on the crankshaft looks like a cross) sit at a sweet spot of packaging - its only 4 cylinders deep so it can fit under hoods easily, but can pack a large engine displacement in a nicely sized cube while being vibrationally balanced. They do limit RPMs a bit though because of the cross plane balancing adds rotational mass, so high performance / racing V8s tend to go with flat plane cranks. V6s have even better packaging, but are unbalanced vibrationally, forcing a tradeoff of longevity vs power. Most commercial solutions favor the longevity side of the equation, so most people's perception of a V6 is an uninspiring motor. It doesn't have to be, but a V6 that outputs a ton of power is also an engine about to shake itself to bits. Inline 4s have excellent packaging as well but are also terribly balanced, often requiring an extra shaft to keep the engine even remotely smooth, so power output is very weak. But because of the small size they can still rev well, so they're used where engine efficiency is more important than broad performance. Inline 6s are better than V8s and basically every other engine at power delivery and smoothness (its why BMW uses them) but packaging them is really hard because they're very long and practically require rear wheel drive. If what you care about is performance of an engine and no other considerations, you want an inline 6 or its bigger brother, a v12 (which is two I6s working together, so butter smooth). Horizontally opposed engines (Subaru, Porsche) are balanced and have near perfect behavior internally, but are a total bitch to package. Subaru's understeer is a result of having to hang the engine really far out in front of the wheels to make room for AWD. Older Porsches have a reputation as Widow Makers due to the engine hanging far out the back of the car causing oversteer. Flat plane V8s have lower rotational mass so they rev higher and generally produce more power, but lose some of the V8 engine balancing. These are used in higher performance engines (Ferrari uses this layout, as well as the new Ford GT350) but require more maintenance and tend to have shorter effective lives. V10s are used in some applications and have some benefits, but its mostly a 'I have a bigger number than you' sort of thing. So why are V8s so popular? They're the 'poor man's performance' engine: cross plane V8s sit at a great intersection of balanced engine, packaging, and RPM potential. They're not great at all 3, mind: in fact, far from. But if what you're looking for is everyman's performance, cross plane V8 will fit in anything and deliver great performance, while not costing too much. There are some misconceptions that are common: low RPM torque is one of them. The V8 configuration has nothing to do with that - it has everything to do with the tuning of the engine with respect to camshaft profile and flow. Racing configured engines focueds on high RPM performance tend to have really poor low RPM performance, and small I4 engines can have lower RPM torgue with turbos or by camming them down, but their peak will then suffer as a result and be even more boring. The desirability of V8s in car culture has to do with the accessibility of power at the V8 configuration. Because of the factors above, the most big engine cars commercially made tend to stick with the V8 configuration due to its ease of packaging. Car culture then connected power to V8, even though that isn't the cause. Additionally, cross plane V8s have a sound that is very distinct and to my ears absolutely sexy, though the purr of an I6 or flat 6 is equally sexy to me as well. ---- A lot of other questions. Yeah, the VR6 is worth a mention, so are Wankels, as well as I5s. All really cool solutions to interesting problems. A lot of those things have been addressed but one thing wasn't: what actually determines whether or not an engine performs well? Think about a bike. You have the easiest time pushing on the pedal when it is rotated out at 90 degrees, so the pedal arm is parallel to the ground. Another example of this is its hardest to do the bicep curl when your arm is parallel - > gravity has the best lever on your muscle at that point. A piston is the same: the goal is to get the peak combustion pressure on the piston as its descending right around when the crank is rotated 90 degrees. The problem is the engine spins at a range of speeds, and so it takes different amounts of time for the flame to reach the piston. A ton of factors go into this, and its all about balancing these issues to get an engine to perform the way you need for that solution: A long stroke forces the flame to travel further, meaning its easier to get it to strike the piston head correctly at low engine speeds. At high engine speeds, the piston is moving away from the flame very fast and its hard to get it to reach peak pressure at the optimal time. A short stroke, wide bore has a shorter distance to travel so the flame front impacts the piston best at high speeds - at low speeds you need to hold ignition until really late. The more metal turning, the more force it takes to turn it. Reducing the amount of mass in rotation and the total surface area in contact allows more of the energy to be used for moving the vehicle, yielding fuel economy and power gains. If done improperly or over-zealously, removing mass will reduce the lifecycle of the engine. The engine needs to 'flow' well, or allow air in and out at the right times. The cycle of a cylinder happens really fast, and in that period of time all the air for combustion needs to get in, injected, compressed, and ignited. Getting that cylinder packed with as much air as possible allows more fuel to be dumped in, giving more power. Everything that moves needs to have a counter-movement somewhere else. This is to handle those vibrations. I can go on and on. I love engines. Hi there, assuming both engines are 4-cycle type, one difference is that the 8 cylinder engine will have 8 power cycles (8 power output pulses) per 2 rotations of the crank vs. 6 with the 6-cylinder engine. With all other things equal this would mean the power delivery is smoother. Luxury cars tend (especially in older days) have more cylinders to get the smoothest output possible - sometimes up to 16 cylinders! The torque curve (torque output vs. RPM) would likely be broader with the 8-cylinder engine again as it has more power pulses per rotation. So more cylinders for a given volume does have advantages, but also disadvantages - namely added complexity and cost. Adding 2 more cylinders doesn't sound like a lot, but that's more crank to spin, 2 more connecting rods and pistons, at least 2 more injectors, these days 2 more ignition coils etc. So if you are a car company you might stick with lower cylinder count to get costs down, and potentially have better reliability with the reduction in complexity. The answer is the surface area to volume ratio. When you make lots of smaller cylinders versus fewer large ones, you are creating more surface area per given volume. This has the effect of more effective cylinder aspiration per capacity and rpm, which means youre spending less energy in getting air in and out, so more power heads out the crankshaft instead. Another big advantage is that smaller cylinders have higher rev limits. It is (a little bit) easier to make power by spinning faster over other methods like forced induction. Think of it like a rowboat, where each person rows one after the other. One boat has 6 stronger guys rowing, and the other has 8 weaker guys. But their combined strength is equal. So if you're pulling something heavy, fewer stronger guys is better. If you are pulling something light and want to accelerate quickly, then more rowers is better. For what it's worth, a 4.0L V8 will be able to rev higher than a 4.0L V6. That's because the per piston displacement is lower on the V8, in this case, 0.5L/piston, and the V6 would come in at 0.66L/piston. What this means is the V8 will have a smaller bore/smaller piston and a smaller stroke. This means less rotating mass and, with the shorter stroke, less movement of the piston. This means this specific 4.0L V8 would be able to rev higher without stressing the crankshaft and connecting rods. The balance (as others have mentioned) is an added perk. You'll see this come into play: for example, Porsche used a 4.5L V8 in the Cayenne introduced back in the early 2000s. General Motors (Pontiac) had a 3.8 L V6. Even though the Porsche is a larger motor, they were able to get the engine to redline at 6,500 RPM, whereas General Motors accomplished only 6,000 RPM out of their V6. There are some other considerations that play into that outcome, but the displacement of each cylinder is no small part of that difference. The reason that engines with more cylinders, all other things being equal, traditionally make more power than engines with fewer cylinders (and a little less torque, and all at higher engine-speeds) is that engines with smaller pistons and shorter strokes (so engines of equal displacement but with more cylinders) can go faster, and so process more fuel, and so produce more power, for the same overall displacement. This is for three reasons: 1. engines with smaller cylinders have lower reciprocating mass in each cylinder, so they deal with smaller forces reversing the direction of travel of the piston / con-rod / crankshaft / valves at a given speed (in rpms) 2. engines with smaller cylinders tend to have shorter strokes, so the maximum practical velocity of a piston is reached at a higher engine speed. 3. engines with smaller cylinders can burn a fuel charge faster, since the flame inside the cylinder does not have to travel as far. Bore (how wide each cylinder is) and stroke (how tall the height of the piston travel) determine the size of the cylinder. Bigger cylinders have higher volume to surface area, ideally leading to lower weight than smaller cylinders, but also taller stroke so the piston can't travel as quickly, leading to lower RPM. I think most sports cars have engines that are about square or oversquare, meaning stroke is equal to or less than the bore. Economy and mass market cars almost always are undersquare, so stroke is greater than bore. Lots of terrible and incorrect bullshit in here, but maybe if I don't get buried I can clear it up: First of all, you can't really explain it like you're five. Understanding an engine completely basically takes a mechanical engineering degree. Ironically, your actual mechanic doesn't even understand your engine as much as he would imply he does. He might know fuel+spark=bang, but I assure that he doesn't even begin to understand the real thermodynamic realities of an engine. Assuming these engines are designed to be as identical as possible with no additional technology or special techniques between them, the biggest difference would likely be that the V8 would be smoother and possibly more powerful/higher revving due to better fuel/air mixing in the cylinder. Also, the V8 may have lower fuel economy at cruising engine loads due to frictional losses. Now, it's tricky to say for sure for this analogy because the change in cylinder size could be bore, stroke, or a combination, so let's assume proportionally scaled cylinders to not skew the analogy. Having smaller cylinders (but the same total volumetric displacement in total) means you can fill the cylinders with an air/fuel mixture faster, which allows for higher revving without losing the ability to successfully burn the fuel each combustion cycle. There's also other factors like the camshafts and valves being able to keep up (i.e. valve float), but we'll assume those are ""perfect"" in that regard. You may also have better low end power as well as even on the low end the ability to efficiently fill and combust in each cylinder will likely produce more power (again, super hard to generalize this much as a true 1:1 V6- > V8 comparison is almost impossible). Someone made an analogy to strong rowers vs fast rowers or something like that, but honestly that's more akin to comparing a high torque low revving motor vs a low torque high revving motor that output the same horsepower. So, why not make every engine a lower displacement V12 instead of of an inline 4 or V6? Biggest factor: cost. Second factor: reliability. Third factor: frictional drivetrain losses. The more cylinders you have, the more parts you have to make, inventory, and assemble. This naturally gets expensive and therefore the fewer cylinders you can use to get the power output you want, the better from a cost standpoint. Regarding reliability, this is a tricky topic as some will misinterpret it. In endurance racing, multi-cylinder engines are actually typically *more* reliable because using multiple smaller cylinders means each cylinder is producing less heat and can be more effectively cooled by the cooling system. It also means that if one cylinder fails in a non-catastrophic way, the car may still be able to continue driving successfully with minimal power losses compared to a car with fewer cylinders. However, in day-to-day situations, high cylinder count engines mean many more moving parts which introduces more potential points of failure, and it can also be difficult to tune (or, at least used to be back in the carburetor days). Going back to cost, get ready to open your wallet if you need the spark plugs or other service done as you are multiplying it by many times for that V12. As for frictional losses, this goes back to complexity. You have many more valves, valve springs, cam lobes, connecting rod bearings, etc. all creating frictional losses. This is why high cylinder count engines tend to have shitty mileage as during low throttle situations there is so much detracting from the power output and therefore requiring more fuel for the same amount of power. This further encourages companies to try to get the power they want from a 4 or 6 cylinder engine as it means (usually) better fuel economy at cruising power situations, which is where most drivers spend the bulk of their time. Now, all of this goes out of the window when you bring turbos or superchargers into the equation. All of the sought after 6 cylinder engines you hear about are durable variants meant for turbocharging, which effectively acts as artificial displacement when the turbo spools and introduces more air into the cylinders each combustion cycle. A large turbo V6 might act like a V12 with double the displacement when it comes to peak power output, but without the extra engine weight and frictional losses. Still, all of this said, it's so hard to truly make an apples-to-apples comparison as there would be so many nitty gritty differences between a 4L V6 and a 4L V8 to ever truly compare the two. Ford had a 300 cubic inch inline 6 and a 302 cubic inch V-8 for many years. The 6 had a 4"" bore and 3.98"" stroke. The 8 had a 4"" bore and 3"" stroke. Same bore in both engines, but the 6 had a longer stroke to make up the same volume. One big difference between 6 and 8 cylinder engines of equal displacement is that the 8 has more valves. Since maximum valve size is restricted by bore size, and since the 2 engines have the same bore, the maximum valve size is the same in the 6 and 8 engines in this example. More valve area (because of more valves) = more airflow. More airflow = more power. The biggest difference is cylinder size. First off: Piston= the part of the engine that moves up and down Cylinder= the tube the piston moves in. Revs= revolutions per minute. Redline= the maximum revolutions per minute. Bore= the width measured across the piston. Stroke= how far the piston moves. Power= how fast the wheels turn. Torque=how hard the car pushes. A 4l engine has 6x667cm³ cylinders as a V6, or 8x500cm³ cylinders as a V8. For an engine of roughly the same physical size and design, the V8 engine will rev harder, and have more power due to a higher redline, but less torque. The reason behind this is the engines size is defined as bore x stroke x number of cylinders. A longer stroke generates more torque, at the cost of a lower redline. A shorter stroke allows a higher redline, and gets to redline faster as the piston does not have to go as far. A smaller bore piston is lighter, and can rev faster, but must have smaller valves, which means less air. A smaller cylinder size must have either a shorter stroke, a smaller bore or both. The design choice is usually a shorter stroke, which gives a sportier engine, that revs fast and hard.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 96.52, 'recall': 3.39, 'fmeasure': 6.56}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 47.37, 'recall': 1.65, 'fmeasure': 3.19}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 67.83, 'recall': 2.38, 'fmeasure': 4.61}}"

Rider says ""no front wheel I wanted you to go THIS way"" rear wheel is like ""WTF dude making me swing the other way now?"" so now the front wheel and the rear wheel are in a pissing match with the driver who is now frantically trying to make the front wheel do what he wants. This causes a feedback loop making it worse and worse until they both decide to leave the party. Keep everything tight, and do not try to ""correct"" wobbles, you might hear the phrase ""ride them out"" and that just means let nature take its course, do not freak out and try to tell that front wheel to stop wobbling, it doesn't like that and will punish you thusly. Edit for fun: it's practically impossible for a motorcycle at that speed, or any two wheeled vehicle really, to wipe itself out without any external factors influencing it. Without a rider, that bike would have gone forever until it hit bumps or such. It naturally wants to right itself up and down (why you can get out of leans so easily) which also contributes to the rider causing wobz. Look into steering stabilizers. I know they're available for sport bikes, presumably others as well. Change your valve stems regularly even if they look fine. My stepdad and mom were at 65 on the interstate when the back tire suddenly deflated due to deteriorated valve stem. Bike started wobbling and ended up wrenching the front wheel fully sideways resulting in a tail over nose roll that catapulted my Mom. She was in the hospital for 7 months. My stepdad had checked the air pressure on before they rode. We couldn't tell what had happened until we went to air up the back tire to see if we could figure out what was wrong and the valve stem came apart in his hand when he went to turn it. This happened to be once on a Yamaha R6 with no steering damper. Well I didn't fall like the guy in the video, but I started to get the wobbles after hitting an awkward dip in the road doing about 70mph. I think the key is not to panic. I grew up riding dirtbikes so having the bike wiggle I guess you could say wasn't all that foreign to me. Most people panic and try to hit the brake. This transfers the weight of rider and bike to the turned front wheel and it's all over. It's like hitting your front brake in a turn. I was able to roll on the throttle and pull out of it. I think this transfers the weight to the back wheel and allows the front wheel to straighten out. It's not first instinct to try and go faster when you start to wobble, so hopefully you can think of it in time.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.58, 'recall': 3.75, 'fmeasure': 7.04}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.38, 'recall': 0.59, 'fmeasure': 1.12}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 42.42, 'recall': 2.76, 'fmeasure': 5.19}}"

Why do most brands of microwave popcorn require one specific side to be placed up?,"I'm not an expert, but I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say that it's to prevent the kernels from popping out of the bottom of the bag. If the bag had a hole in the bottom, the kernels would be able to escape.","There's a super thin lining of aluminium foil on one side of the popcorn bag which, when placed downwards, acts as a pan and causes the temperature to rise much faster than just through the microwaves heating up the water. It took the inventor of microwave popcorn, Jim Watkins, much research to find the exact amount of foil that would act as the accelerator without causing the microwave oven to break down. Source: My father owns a microwave popcorn company. As a side-note: never place the bag on a plate (eg: if the microwave is dirty). The glass rotating disc on the bottom of the microwave does NOT conduct heat, so all the heat gets transferred to the seeds. A regular plate DOES conduct heat, so the oil in the bag will heat up your plate instead of the seeds. Your popcorn won't pop and your plate will break in half. Usually bag construction. The idea is to allow the easiest possible expansion of the bag. If you put it upside down, it's feasible that one of the book folds would get stuck underneath the bag, leaving less room for the corn to expand into. That would then possibly make the rest of the bag break. Not super likely, of course, but may as well just tell people to put it the way up that causes the least amount of potential problems. Thermal shielding (metal) on 1 side radiates the microwaves better, heating the oil & kernels more proficiently to help avoid unpopped kernels, in theory.

How are Cities created/made,"Well, it depends on the city. Some cities are created by the government, and are designed with a purpose in mind. Others are created by people who just happen to have the money to do so. Some cities are created for the purpose of providing jobs for people in a certain industry. Some are created for the purpose of providing jobs for people in a certain industry. Some are created to provide people with a certain type of lifestyle.

Some cities are created to provide people with a certain type of culture, or to be near a certain type of culture.  . Some cities are created to provide people with a certain type of culture, or to be near a certain type of culture.  .  ","Well, it's interesting that you ask that from the UK. Historically, most cities arose as a result of humans wanting to live in a location that provided some economic advantage. Examples include a crossroads on trading routes, port cities, and areas with some natural resource to be exploited. Many of these cities grew up organically based on function and common modes of travel at the time. With European colonialism, cities were 'founded' in the New World and elsewhere. These communities were often planned by a royal governor and laid out according to the best practice of the time. When the Spanish settled the Americas, for example, the [Law of the Indies]( URL_0 ) established rules for where cities should be built and how they should be laid out. In the same vein, various US cities were planned and built by a single visionary 'planner'. Examples include Philadelphia (William Penn), Savannah Georgia (James Oglethorpe), and Washington DC (Pierre L'Enfant). In all of these instances, the city streets were laid out, and spaces such as parks and squares where reserved for the public. The private sector, individual homeowners and commercial developers, built the buildings along the streets according to the established plan. In 1902, a man named Ebenezer Howard proposed a new concept for creating cities: the [Garden City]( URL_1 ). The basic idea was that a city should contain all the elements that you needed, housing, industry, commercial district, etc. in a compact area that was separated by a greenbelt from the next compact community. He actually built a few of these towns in the UK: Garden City of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden. After WWII, the British government adapted this idea to deal with the crowded conditions in cities and the need for more housing, and sets out to build a series of new communities based loosely on the Garden City model. [Milton Keynes]( URL_2 ) is one of those 'New Towns' built by the government. I hope that answers your question. Some cities grow up organically because there was an advantage to settling there and others are planned and executed from a single vision. Planned towns often don't turn out the way people expect. So Welwyn Garden City (for example) was a deliberately planned satellite town in the 1920s. Its beautiful. Its a bit frozen in time (as I remember it from the eighties) Milton Keynes. Wow, thats one wierd place. Very zonal, very definitely a product of designers let loose. People who live there (in both of these cases) love it. visitors often don't Motherwell, and a bunch of other towns outside Glasgow were planned to re-house the slum dwellers from the gorbals. They turned into pretty bad places in some cases. New Cumbernauld, and the like have never appealed to me, but if I'd had to live in what they left behind (I saw glasgow in the 70s) I might feel differently. Linlithgow grew up around a chemicals, plastics and oil industry and was half way between Edina and Glasgow. Its a former royal palace town in fact. Formally, legally, its a city when its given a city charter. Historically, its when a cathedral is built there. In Australia, the economics behind trying to construct new city-like places hasn't always worked well. Allbury-Wadonga was sited at a border where the railway changed guage. rural cities by and large don't thrive in Australia because migration swelled the classic state capital cities which sprang up naturally on the coast. The exception is of course Canberra which like Brazilia and New Delhi is an entirely planned development. Old Canberra was socialize-by-rank and the style of housing reflected a 10 and 20 year planning cycle. New Canberra is now people who live there, second or third generation and its much less of a planned city culture, not everyone in Canberra is there either because of the federal government, or to sell guns, fireworks and porn out at Fyshwick. The other big exception is Queensland, which has a string of regional cities up the coastline. Since Queensland is a long thin(ish) big state, over 2000km long, maybe this worked better than it did in NSW, where the regionals like Wollongong and Newcastle are steel and coal towns, which died when the industry did (ok: unfair on both. Hit me) More recently, to try and limit the Gold-Coast Brisbane sprawl, we've had a clutch of semi-private city-like developments spring up. Springwood, and development close to the sunshine coast, partyly a venture-capital investment breaking new land (well.. farming land) and partly state government funded. The killer questions are always the same: where is the School, where is the Railway, where is the Hospital. So you can plan it, but ""if you build it they will come"" doesn't always work. You can grow what you've got, but thats urban sprawl. Planning is a nightmare. Legally, it has to be nominated and created. its just an overgrown town otherwise. Most cities just grow naturally by themselves. If you dig down in many cities in Europe you will find remains of settlements dating back millennia. Even among younger settlements there usually isn't much design involved. Just a bunch of houses being built close to each other and slowly growing from tiny village to big city. Usually there is something there that makes the place a good place to settle, like a road leading to a ford in a river or a pass though mountains or in some case nearby natural resources. Towns would be recognized as such by rulers and given privileges based on their size which further helped them grow. Things like tax jurisdictions and free trade policies helped shape where and how cities grow. If the growth of the settlement is fast enough somebody might try to direct an order the whole thing, but a few centuries ago urban planning was not really too much of a thing. There are however planned cities where there were none before. Milton Keynes is one such city that was created by design and not accident. A number of countries have their Nations capital be a designed and planned city, like Brasilia and Canberra. In such cases committees of designers and architects and city planners designed the general layout of the city and what went where from the ground up. eventually natural growth may take over and to a degree.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 59.38, 'recall': 8.79, 'fmeasure': 15.31}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 11.95, 'recall': 1.76, 'fmeasure': 3.07}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 38.75, 'recall': 5.74, 'fmeasure': 9.99}}"
"Theoretically, why can't countries shut off their power grids in case of an impending nuclear strike to avoid them getting fried by the EMP?","Љ Theoretically, they could. But they wouldn't. They would be shutting down the power grids to protect their own people, and the power grids would be shutting down the people who would be trying to do that. Љ I'm not sure if this is a real thing, but I heard that if a nuke hit a power grid, the electromagnetic pulse would fry the computers and other electronics. This would cause all the power plants to shut down and the grid to go dark. This is why you see people in movies and TV shows wearing those little foil hats. So I guess the answer is that they would shut down the power grid to avoid the electromagnetic pulse. I'm not sure if this is true, but I remember hearing it somewhere. Љ I think this is what you're asking. If the nuke is going to hit the power grid, then the power grid will shut down. And if the power grid shuts down, then the nuke can't hit the power grid. Љ This is a great question. The short answer is that if a nuclear weapon was launched at a power grid, the EMP would destroy the grid. If a power grid were shut down, it would be shut down to protect the people who would be trying to do that. Љ The EMP would fry everything.  ","EMP doesn't quite work the way it does in video games. What it does is it sends out a pulse that will temporarily charge conductors, semi-conductors and other electronics. The reason this ruins power grids and electronics is because it shorts out a system. A system doesn't have to be turned on for it to short. Having said that, almost all modern systems have fuses to prevent this kinda short. Basically, any EMP attack will just pop a whole bunch of fuses. As an aside, lightning strikes release some of the most powerful EMPs and although they've been known to take down power grids, it's about as bad as you can get. To protect against an EMP, you would need to completely shield all of your sensitive electronics from electromagnetic radiation. Simply turning off the grid doesn't do this. Even unplugging everything wouldn't keep them from getting fried if they were close enough to the blast.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 26.32, 'recall': 36.81, 'fmeasure': 30.69}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.08, 'recall': 4.32, 'fmeasure': 3.6}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 12.28, 'recall': 17.18, 'fmeasure': 14.32}}"
Why haven't we built huge trains?,"Because they're really expensive and really hard to make, and they're not really needed. There are other ways of moving large amounts of things. And trains aren't really the best way to do it anyway. Trains are actually pretty good at moving people, but they're not great at moving things. They're a lot better at moving things than cars, but they're not as good as trucks. Trains are also really good at moving things over long distances, but they're not as good at moving things over short distances. And they're really good at moving things in a straight line, but they're not as good at moving things in a curve. They're also really good at moving things at a steady speed, but they're not as good at moving things at a high speed. And they're really good at moving things on a track, but they're not as good at moving things off the track. So there are a lot of things that trains are really good at, but there are a lot of things that they're not really good at. And it's not really worth it to build a train that's really good at one thing when it's not really good at a lot of other things. And besides, there are a lot of other ways of moving things around.  ","Bigger doesn't always mean better. For trains, specifically, the advancement in technology has been in making the train stronger, not physically larger. There are three major reasons why making trains bigger is a bad thing. 1) Trains run on tracks, so making a bigger train would require replacing tracks with ones of a different size. While tracks have to be replaced eventually, there is no incentive to force the change by making a larger train. 2) Taller trains, which would be required to increase the size without increasing the width, would be less stable during turns, leading to more derailment and crashes. 3) Trains are already modular, and can be expanded near limitlessly by adding cars onto the back of the train. The only limit is the strength of the locomotive, and even that can be augmented by having extra cars for driving force. These trains can be collosal in their own rite, with the largest container train in the world being the 4.2 km long double-stack container operated by Canadian National Railway. The largest test-run train was the BHP Run on June 21, 2001 comprising 682 cars and eight 6000hp locomotives in Australia.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 15.19, 'recall': 18.18, 'fmeasure': 16.55}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.85, 'recall': 1.02, 'fmeasure': 0.92}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 8.02, 'recall': 9.6, 'fmeasure': 8.74}}"
How does a computer 'know' how long a second is?,"'Know' is a bit of a tricky word in this context. Computers don't really know anything, they just follow rules. In this case, the rules are defined by humans, who are the ones who decided that a second is 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation emitted by the cesium-133 atom. The computer doesn't really know anything about cesium-133, it just follows the rules. The cesium-133 atom emits a specific type of radiation. We know how many periods of that radiation make a second. So we set up a clock that oscillates at that frequency, and we measure how many periods it makes in a second.

When you take a conventional x-ray, it passes through once and takes a photo, so to speak. So let's say you wanted to take a photo of a person, but someone else was standing in the way and they or your subject can't move. Or say you wanted to take a panoramic photo. You'd need to take multiple shots and tie them together. CT is like that. It shoots from multiple angles and stitches the image together to create a more 3-dimensional image, allowing for better details and thus better understanding of what's happening in there. The same thing could be done with a regular x-ray if they just kept rolling you around the table and hitting the button. The difference is that the CT puts them all together for you and allows you to see things more clearly and with less exposure time, because doing that with a conventional x-ray would take hours at least, depending on the target. Additionally, the X-ray shots would not differentiate relationships, while the CT program typically can. This means that your 3D image created by the CT would show dimensions, separating the organs and such, while your x-ray shots would not. Like maybe a doctor wants to look at the *front* of your lung, he would have trouble doing so with a regular x-ray because the heart's in the way. So why don't they do this every time? Well, a CT is super expensive and not always available. The exposure itself is also way more expensive. Last and most importantly, the patient is receiving an x-ray dose through his body at hundreds of times higher than a regular x-ray, and every exposure a person receives leaves something behind permanently, so if they did a CT on you every time you needed an image, you'd hit critical levels of life dose pretty fast.

Torque in relation to a car's performance?,"There are a few different ways to consider torque in relation to a car's performance. One way is to look at it as a measure of how hard the engine is working. The harder the engine is working, the more fuel it will burn, and the more energy it will produce. This means that a car with a lot of torque is able to accelerate faster and go faster. Another way is to look at it as a measure of the force on the wheels. The harder the wheels are pushing against the road, the more traction they have, and the faster they will be able to accelerate. This is why cars with a lot of torque are also able to accelerate faster. A third way is to look at it as a measure of the car's power-to-weight ratio. This is a measure of how much power the engine produces relative to how much weight the car has. A car with a lot of torque and a low power-to-weight ratio is able to accelerate faster than a car with a lot of torque and a high power-to-weight ratio. A car with a low power-to-weight ratio and a low torque is able to accelerate slower than a car with a low power-to-weight ratio and a high torque.","ELI5: Torque: acceleration Horsepower: Top speed. For older than 5, It's a bit more complicated than that, there's a ""torque curve"" meaning how much torque you have at any given RPM. If you have torque at low RPM, you can feel the push coming off of a redlight. If you have good torque at high RPM, you can get a push once you're already moving, good for passing on a highway. If you have a ""fat torque curve"" you have good torque at both low and high RPM, a good car for driving on curvy roads. The acceleration you feel is down to the torque at the wheels which is a product of the engine torque and the total gearing (gear and diff ratios, wheel size etc.). This means talking about engine torque isn't very useful in isolation as you need to know what gearing you can use which is dictated by what rev range the engine can produce torque over. In other words you could have a very low torque engine but if it revs twice as high as an engine with twice the torque, you could get the same wheel torque as you could gear it twice as low. Power is just the product of torque*revs/5252 so basically it takes the revs into account which makes it a useful figure for directly comparing vehicles as you don't need to know what the gearing is or anything else to get a feel for if it's a fast car (assuming it has ""appropriate"" gearing). Basically torque is transformed by gearing but power is an absolute figure that tells you how much work the engine can actually do. Perfect example being F1 vs Nascar, low torque/high revs/low gearing vs high torque/low revs/high gearing but both make similar power and perform similarly. You would predict that if you looked at their power:weight ratios but you wouldn't predict it from their engine torque:weight ratios. TL:DR ""got some poke"" comes from wheel torque which is not necessarily the result of a lot of *engine* torque...it could be due to very low gearing. Power figures cover off that issue...high power:weight ratio = fast car. In terms of performance not much. What's import is the total power put out and where the power is on the rpm range. Breaking it down to a formula you have Power = torque x rpm. Torque being a measure of how much force each rotation of the engine exerts and power being the force output per second. When people say that an engine with high torque is better what the are generally actually talking about is an engine where the power is available across a wide band usually lower down the rpm range this is useful for towing for example as it saves the need for a large number of gear ratios to keep the engine at the required power. If you wanted to you could use a small high reving motorbike engine with all it's power concentrated in a narrow band at a high rpm. You would just need a hell of a lot of gears to keep the rotating at the optimal speed. This video explains much better than i could URL_0 At 20:56 it even answers the exact question in your post. A scalar quantity is a number. For example 9.81 is a scalar quantity. A vector quantity has a direction and a magnitude, so imagine an arrow of a given direction and of a given length. Velocity is a rate of change in position, a vector quantity, and we call the magnitude ""speed"". For example, 30 mph going west. Force is a vector quantity, and we call it's magnitude ""acceleration"". Force applied to a mass over time will change it's velocity. So 30 mph going west and increasing west at 5 mph per second. Torque is force applied to an axis, so you can see how torque is important to acceleration. Work, force applied over a distance, will become important in a moment. The base unit is the joule. So applying 20 Newtons of force over 2 meters = 20 joules of energy. You can double the work by either doubling the weight and keeping the distance, or keeping the weight and doubling the distance. Power is work over time. The base unit is the Watt, and horsepower is a derived unit, so the two are convertible. In order to cross a room in half the time, you have to perform twice the work. So in order to go 200 mph, you need to apply torque (force) more frequently in the given period of time. So torque will increase your *speed*, but if you want to increase your *acceleration*, you need horsepower. You can have lots of torque, there are 14 cylinder cargo ship engines with pistons over 3' wide that produce ~8m ft/lbs of torque, and if that thing were fit to a car, it would absolutely get you to whatever speed you want to go, provided you had the appropriate gearing, but that doesn't mean it will accelerate you *quickly*. And this is why torque and horsepower are confusing, they're interrelated and explain the rate of change of different things.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 72.81, 'recall': 18.61, 'fmeasure': 29.64}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.94, 'recall': 4.83, 'fmeasure': 7.69}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.21, 'recall': 8.74, 'fmeasure': 13.93}}"
"why are house keys one-sided, while car keys are two-sided?","The keys are one-sided because it's easier to make the key in a one-sided way, and then use it to open the door. You can make the key and test it on the door before you put it in the lock. If it doesn't work, you can just turn it around and try it again. When you make a car key, you have to make it so it fits in the lock on the car, and you can't test it on the car until you're ready to use it. If you make a mistake, you have to start over. Because the car is much more expensive than the house, they don't want to make the key twice. It's also easier to make a key in a one-sided way. You just cut the teeth on one side, and then you're done. If you try to make a two-sided key, you have to cut the teeth on both sides, and that's much harder.","Car keys are designed to be used in a situation where you can't easily see the lock. So your convenience they cut the pattern into both sides. Contrary to conventional wisdom, it's not a design issue for convenience. Every time you insert a key into a lock, the teeth on the key wear down a bit. House keys have the teeth on one side, but realistically you only use a house key in a front door a few times a day, and you probably have multiple keys for spouse, kids, neighbours etc. Not only does your car key start your car, but (in older cars at least) it also opens the boot (sorry I'm English), the door, and sometimes even the glovebox. It's also a tonne more expensive and inconvenient to replace a car key than it is a house key, and you probably don't know where your spare is. Cutting the teeth into both sides reduces wear on the each side by 50% (statistically).

Why did the Grenfell tower not fall like the WTC?,"The WTC was made of steel and the Grenfell was made of aluminum. Aluminum is not as strong as steel, but it is much lighter. This means that the Grenfell tower would have to be much taller in order to be as strong as the WTC. The Grenfell tower was made of aluminum because it was cheaper and lighter than steel. The WTC was made of steel because it was cheaper and stronger than aluminum.","At least a couple of reasons off the top of my head: 1: It wasn't as tall as the WTC and therefore did not have as much stress weighing the whole structure down. 2: It wasn't slammed into by a fully laden airliner, destroying the structural integrity of the architectural engineering. Grenfell tower was a typical British tower block, basically a big ugly slab of concrete. The core of those towers are a concrete lift shaft which is also a large portion of the strength of the building. They were not designed to be beautiful, or to be engineering achievements, they were built to be cheap easy housing for large numbers of poorer people built by semi skilled labor. The WTC on the other hand was a framed tube construction, much of the strength came from the outer walls. It was also designed to push the limits of engineering and to be a design statement of look how much bigger and better we can build than anyone else. With Grenfell and the other UK housing estates they would just build a thicker wall rather than work out precisely how thick it needs to be. With the WTC they took great pains to cut as much excess as possible. A very tall building can probably survive: - A single large impact - A single moderately powerful explosion - A severe fire Grenfell tower survived the last one. A good tower might be able to survive two of them. WTC experienced all 3 when it got hit by fueled jet liners that crashed, exploded and burned.

Why do highways cause more traffic?,"A highway is a road that has been built to facilitate high speed traffic. The purpose of a highway is to move people and goods more efficiently than would be possible on a smaller road. As more people start to use a highway, the speed of traffic increases, and it becomes more difficult to stop. If you have ever been on a highway, you know that the speed limit is usually 65 mph. This is because the highway is built to accommodate traffic traveling at this speed. When the speed of traffic is higher than the speed limit, it is called speeding. When traffic is moving at a speed below the speed limit, it is called slowing down.",Highways make more people travel by car. This effect is often bigger then the size of the highway so you might inadvertently cause traffic to move slower. For example if you were to build a highway from a city to a nearby town then a lot of people will move out of the city to the town and a lot of the people living in the town would take work in the city instead of locally. And not only work but people would go to the city more often for events and other things. So by creating the highway you now have a massive increase in traffic.,"{'rouge1': {'precision': 33.9, 'recall': 37.38, 'fmeasure': 35.56}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.13, 'recall': 5.66, 'fmeasure': 5.38}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.25, 'recall': 16.82, 'fmeasure': 16.0}}"
"When I turn on the lights in my room, the interference on my AM radio is greatly reduced. What's going on here?","The radio signal has to travel through the air to reach your radio, and there are lots of things that can interfere with that signal. Light bulbs can be a source of interference, because they can reflect the radio signal. This is called ""multipath interference"", and it can be reduced by turning off the lights.","If you do have a dimmer switch and it allows some amount of current through in the off position (might be defective/damaged/not quite pushed all the way off) then it could be producing the interference. Most dimmer switches work by very rapidly flickering the power going to the light. Current running through a wire produces a magnetic field, an amplitude fluctuated (flicking the power on and off very quickly) magnetic field is an AM (amplitude modulation) radio signal, thus when the dimmer rhythmically interrupts the current it produces a weak AM radio signal. The reason the interference would clear up when you turn the light fully on is that the current is no longer fluctuating, the magnetic field is steady, and so it no longer interacts noticably with the radio. Credit to URL_0 for filling me in on dimmer switches. I can imagine a defective or damaged regular switch creating the same power flickering effect in the off position, never providing enough continuous current to cause the bulb to heat up enough to glow, though I'm not sure how specifically that might happen. tldr: a bad or broken dimmer switch can turn your wiring into an AM radio transmitter. You have a dimmer switch in your room? I don't know the science behind it, but they are notorious for messing with radio reception. It's a long shot, since we know nearly nothing about your wiring. Every conductor carrying a voltage is an antenna. So is the wiring in your house. The length of the antenna has to be adapted to the wave length (and therefore the frequency) of your signal. E.g. a 100Mhz signal has a wave length of 3 meters. ( Wavelength = speed of light / frequency ). Antenna length like 1/2 wavelength, 1/4 wavelength also work well. . My guess is that the length of a wire in your house matches to the wavelength of your am radio. The wire is a weak antenna, but it's close to your radio, so it can distort the signal enough to create interference. As soon as you turn on the light the switch closes and increases the ""length"" of the wire, increasing the length of the antenna. The interfering signal cannot be transmitted well be this ""new"" antenna - > the interference is gone If the radio antenna is the electrical chord, as in some radios, you've connected the circuit and now have significantly lengthened the total wire length for your antenna. ""Interference is reduced"" — do you mean the reception gets *better* with the light switch on? If so, the most likely explanation is that some wires in your ceiling or walls became connected that weren't connected before, and these act as antenna reflectors, changing the reception in the room. Or perhaps they *stop* acting as reflectors. The science of radio antennas is really quite complicated. If you mean the reception gets worse in your room, then the explanation could be the antenna reflector stuff I mentioned above, or more likely interference from a dimmer, or interference from the electronics in the light bulb if it's fluorescent or LED.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 70.91, 'recall': 7.43, 'fmeasure': 13.45}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.67, 'recall': 1.72, 'fmeasure': 3.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 41.82, 'recall': 4.38, 'fmeasure': 7.93}}"
Why are many bathroom sink faucets so close to the back of the sink?,"There is a long history of faucets being designed that way. The reason for this is that the faucet spout was originally designed to be mounted at a 90 degree angle to the sink, so that the spout would be pointing downwards.   designed to be mounted in this position so that it could be easily cleaned.   also designed to be mounted at this angle so that it would not be in the way of the sink.   designed to be mounted at this angle so that it would not be in the way of the sink.   designed to be mounted at this angle so that it would not be in the way of the sink.   designed to be mounted at this angle so that it would not be in the way of the sink.   designed to be mounted at this angle so that it would not be in the way of the sink.   designed to be mounted at this angle so that it would not be in the way of the sink.   designed to be mounted at this angle so that it would not be in the way of the sink.   designed to be mounted at this angle so that it would not be in the way of the sink.   designed to be mounted at this angle so that it would not be in the way of the sink.  ","Depends on the design, but I think it's at least partly because of how older bathrooms did their bathroom sinks. Basically the sink was a bowl, and you filled it up with water from the faucet, hot water would be a separate faucet, and you would add that in to get the right temperature. Then you wash your hands in the sink, and pull the drain to empty it. The faucets were thus small so they don't get in the way of your hands. I know in the UK, many people still have this style of sink in the bathroom, [they look like this]( URL_0 ). In the US at least, we have gone away from that style of sink, and just wash our hands under the tap. But we still use faucets that look similar, probably for aesthetics reasons (putting a large kitchen sink style faucet would look odd), and partly because we still do wash things in the sink other than our hands, it may be useful to have a small faucet. And finally, if you're hitting your hands on the sink, it's probably because they installed the wrong faucet. On many sinks, the holes for the faucet are pre-drilled, their location is meant for a faucet of a specific size (one that stretches some distance from the edge), sometimes people buy sinks with the holes set back and couple it with a faucet that is short meant for holes set forward resulting in a faucet that's too close to the edge. Sometimes the holes are not pre-drilled and the installer drills them too far back. Spout reach is a spec listed for the faucet on home depot, people forget to check it when picking parts sometimes. The reason is probably cost reduction. The faucet is most likely a casting. Castings of consumer products are made in such a high volume that costs associated with design (such as fancy curves, etc.) don't impact the cost of an individual unit much. The primary cost is the material. A shorter faucet means less metal and a lower cost.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 37.72, 'recall': 24.16, 'fmeasure': 29.45}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.49, 'recall': 4.79, 'fmeasure': 5.84}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 22.81, 'recall': 14.61, 'fmeasure': 17.81}}"
"Electricity can't be stored, so when a light gets turned on, the power station must immediately produce some extra electricity. How is this possible?","The power station doesn't have to produce extra electricity. The power station is producing electricity at a constant rate. When you turn on a light, the electricity is already being produced. The power station has a constant power output. When you turn on the light, you are just using electricity that is already being produced. The power station doesn't have to do anything extra.","As a unit of one, your house's power usage varies wildly and is somewhat unpredictable. As the unit of your residential city block of 20 homes, the small variations in personal schedules cancel out and power usage is more statistically stable. As the unit of your neighborhood of 10000 homes and 100 small businesses, the variations are even smaller. As a unit of your city of a million residents and businesses, the profile of consumer is pretty steady and predicable. Electrical load on a power system is controlled at the generator which compensates for changing loads by adjusting speed and excitation voltage to the generator field. Since most commercial generators are so large these increases in load at such a small scale are inconsequential but if say 1 million people turned on a light at once then the electrician operating the power plant would notice and one of two things would happen either the generator(s) online would increase fuel to the generator(s) to maintain speed or excitation voltage would automatically increase to accommodate the increased load. Or the Electricians can start and parallel in another generator or connect another power plant into the grid if they are producing more power than it is using. In short you turning on a light is a carefully monitored and controlled dance run by thousands of people nation wide, Texas is the only state in the continental US that is not permanently connected to the national power grid. It is possible to store power but this is expensive. When we are talking about the second to second variations in power output and input to the grid the energy is stored in the turbine blades in the power plants which works like flywheels. Similarly any three phase engine common in industrial applications connected directly to the grid will also work as a flywheel and help smooth out the power consumption. So when you switch on a light the power might come from your washing machine. This is actually a problem in the future as wind turbines and solar panels generally do not have a big flywheel directly on the grid as traditional power plants do. So we may in the future have big flywheels installed to better smooth out the demand for power. Or we might come up with a system of capacitors or batteries. Somewhere on the grid, a power station really does adjust its output. Since the adjustments cannot be quite so precise as adjusting for a single light bulb, the amount of power on the grid is allowed to fluctuate slightly -- which is visible as a slight variation in voltage or frequency seen by thousands of users. In a nutshell, as more load/demand is placed on the electricity network, the frequency starts to drop (say from 50Hz down to 49.9Hz). The power station generators have 'governors' which detect this and increase their output in response (its a feedback loop). It's possible by allowing some variation in the voltage, if we have 230V supplying 100 light bulbs just fine, and you turn on another one, they'll all share a little bit less power, but they're ok with that. If your lamp is only glowing at 99% potential it's also only consuming 99%, so you're not paying that extra 1% either. But at the power station they'll soon notice that they are now a bit low so they crank up the power a bit so they can sell you and all the other 100 light bulb users another 1% of power. It's not just for selling they do it though, that was just for the ELI5 ;), they need to provide a somewhat stable voltage, they'd also decrease the production if the voltage went up 1% because someone switched off a lamp, they need to keep as close to the baseline as possible to be able to handle variations in any direction as well as possible. I heard (saw actually.. on Discovery Channel I think) that one of the most challenging situations like this for the power companies in UK are when a big football game ends, and all the britts go to boil their tea water, it produces a huge spike in the power consumption that is really difficult to respond to with the generators, so all power companies need to follow the game to be ready to respond and predict exactly when this peak will happen.

Where does human waste go on cruise ships?,Most cruise ships have their own farm. The farm produces most of the food that is used on the ship. The farm is self sustaining and produces a lot of food. The ship also buys food from port to port. The ship will go to a port and buy food from local farmers. The ship will then take the food back to the ship and cook it.,"There are two ways to deal with sewage: treatment and storage. Most modern ships are equipped with a sewage treatment plant. This plant can use either bacteria, chemicals, or other methods to break down the sewage and turn it into cleaner water. Depending on which regulation the ship follows, the treated black water is pumped over the side. If there is solid waste that still remains, or pumping over the side is not an option, the sewage can be kept in sewage holding tanks. These tanks are then emptied to sewage trucks/facilities when the ship is in port. In some cases, solid sewage is also allowed to be pumped over the side if certain requirements are met. On my ship, which has a max capacity of 26 people but regularly holds 16, our sewage tanks hold about 30 tonnes of sewage. We usually pump it ashore when it gets in the 20 tonne range, and we do so once every couple months or so.

"Did mechanical and analog computers use Logic Gates before transistors? If so, how were they implemented?","Yes, they did. The first computers were made up of vacuum tubes. These tubes were essentially light bulbs with a tiny filament inside them. The filament was used to carry an electrical charge. When the charge was sent to the filament, it glowed, and that was how the computer did its work. The first computers were very slow, and the tubes were very hot. But they worked. When transistors were invented, they were used instead of the vacuum tubes. They were faster and they were cooler.","You can totally build mechanical logic gates and build basic computing elements like half-adders and more complex stuff from this. There are videos out there of people having build stuff like this from Lego and similar. [(Example)]( URL_0 ) The problem here is that these tend to be big and clunky and if you add up enough of them to be useful you will get into real mechanical troubles very fast. Electrically you can use devices such a vacuum tubes to have the same function as transistors made from semiconductors and build logic gates out of them. Early digital computers were build out of large numbers of vacuum tubes which had the unfortunate side-effects of burning out all the time, limiting the working time of computers and were also quiet big making miniaturization hard. Analogue computers (both electrical and others) were never that popular and didn't really use logic gates as they were never really based on the on/off dichotomy but instead worked by using what may thought of a sliding scale of values for inputs and outputs. Before electronic computer became common mechanical computers exited that may be said to be digital after a fashion, but they generally did not use the modern logic gate based design. There were calculators based on cog and wheel designs that you could use to automate basic arithmetic operations. Leibniz (who simultaneously with Newton invented calculus) created a working model of a mechanical calculator which function by means of cleverly arranged gears, cogs and cranks to allow someone to do basic calculations. This design with refinements lived on up until the point where electronics became good enough to build handheld calculators. The famous [Curta]( URL_1 ) calculator is an example of this type of mechanical computers that were used up until the 1970s. Analog computers don't really operate that way. Digital computers are based on logical operations, and they're good at what they do. Analog computing lends itself more toward straight mathematical operations on continuous numbers that would be difficult to do by hand, and they're (in many ways) better/faster than digital computers for that task If you're asking what they used instead of logic, the essential components of analog computers were called ""op amps"" or operational amplifiers. They don't do the same thing as transistor-based logic gates, but they're the basic building blocks of analog computers in the same way that logic gates and flip flops are they building blocks of digital. This highly depends on your definition of computer. It's name derives from ""compute"", meaning to calculate. Around 2700 bc the first such ""machine"" was used, the abacus. It bascially consists of marbles on a string, allowing you to add and subtract. (Multiplication, and division can be done via multiple applications of add/subtract.) A very simple example of an analog computer is actually a [slide rule] ( URL_1 ). The first thing most would say is a ""real computer"" was the Z3, which used relays and switches to act as transistors. But you can build the whole functionality of a computer mechanically, too. The best explanation I found actually comes from an [advertisment]( URL_0 ) - sorry. What you do is basically the following: You place whips on a board and the drop marbles on it. Some whips have weights, meaning they always return to their previous position. Some whips do not, meaning each time a marble drops on them, they reverse direction, essentially storing information. The input to such a computer would be the order in which you drop marbles. The output would be defined, by which marbles land in the left or the right at the bottom of the board.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 69.77, 'recall': 9.63, 'fmeasure': 16.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 18.82, 'recall': 2.57, 'fmeasure': 4.53}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.56, 'recall': 4.49, 'fmeasure': 7.9}}"
"Why do some structures (Radio towers specifically) have Red lights but, others use White Strobes? What is the difference between the two","
nationalsafetycouncil.org/home-safety/safety-topics/emergency-lights/emergency-lights-color-meaning/ The red light on a tower is used to indicate that it is in operation. The white strobe is used to indicate that the tower is in danger and that it is unsafe to approach.","Tower climber here. I don't know the regulation by heart, but I'll say typically, a white strobe marks the top of the tower, while red (solid or strobe) act as side markers to show the tower's footprint. Not all towers are lit, it depends on the tower's height and it's proximity to an airport or flight path. So, a 199' tower that is not close to an airport may not be required to be lit, while a 150' tower, close to an airport will. You'll also find a lot of towers with heights such as 199 feet because they are built one foot shorter than the regulation requirement to be lit. You can voluntarily light a tower that is below the required height, but once a tower is lit, it must always remain lit and be registered on a FAA map. This is because, while the primary purpose is to be visible by aircraft so that they can avoid it, they also use the lights as landmarks for navigation. Lighting a tower these days can be very expensive because it requires a lot of maintenance, and also now requires a monitoring system to send a message when a light is out. I'm guessing you know already the purpose of these lights is to make structures visible for aircraft? As long as the lights meet the FAA requirements (or the rules wherever you are) colour doesn't really matter. White strobe (usually a xenon globe) is better during the day, red (used to be incandescents, but now mainly leds) are better at night. A lot of places use both (especially towers in high traffic areas) but some settle on one or the other or various reasons. (e.g. cost, maintenance, not pissing off neighbours with a strobe light, etc) As long as they meet the visibility requirement, it doesn't matter.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 61.7, 'recall': 9.15, 'fmeasure': 15.93}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.04, 'recall': 1.9, 'fmeasure': 3.31}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 40.43, 'recall': 5.99, 'fmeasure': 10.44}}"
Why are Fighter Jets so Loud compared to other Jet aircraft? and why does it make the specific sound of the sky being torn apart?," Fighter jets are designed to be fast and maneuverable. The air intake and exhaust system are designed to be as efficient as possible, so that the engines can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.   can produce the maximum amount of thrust.  ","The noise is mainly caused by the huge difference in velocity between the exhaust of the jet engine and the surrounding air. Modern day passenger aircraft use turbofans with a high bypass ratio, which means that most of the air coming out of the back didn't go through the combustion chamber, but just through the large inlet fan. This is much more energy efficient, since you can get a lot more thrust if you move a large amount of air at low speed rather than a small amount of air at high speed. It also has the beneficial side effect of reducing the noise quite significantly. The loudest types of engines around are turbojet engines, which generate all their thrust with the exhaust of the engine. This is not particularly energy efficient, but those engines are a lot smaller than turbofans of equal thrust, and therefore more aerodynamic. There's also a middle ground, a low bypass turbofan. Those are not as bulky as the models used in passenger aircraft, but also not as efficient and quiet. Modern jet fighters usually use low bypass turbofans with the addition of an afterburner, which increases the noise even further if activated. Were you in Yeovilton? Sad the Vulcan doesn’t fly any more. That’s an impressive sounding aircraft. In addition to the technical reasons already given, there's also the factor of the effect noise has on passengers and people on the ground. For passengers, noise decreases comfort. For people on the ground, there would be a *lot* more opposition to airports or increases in flights if civil aeroplanes were as loud as military jets. Both of these would have a negative effect on airlines' profits.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.27, 'recall': 15.73, 'fmeasure': 23.08}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.88, 'recall': 1.4, 'fmeasure': 2.06}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.92, 'recall': 9.79, 'fmeasure': 14.36}}"
How do neighboring countries that drive on different sides of the road connect their roads together?,"They use a common language, they use the same signs and symbols, they have the same speed limits, and they all use the same currency.

How does the flame not spread backwards from a gas stove and cause an explosion in gas pipes?,"There are a few different factors that keep the flame from spreading backwards. The first is that the flame is not a single point source, but a torch, so the fire is spread out. This means that the flame is not concentrated in a single point, so the heat is not concentrated in a single point, so the heat is not concentrated in a single point. The second is that the stove is designed with a vent in the back, so the air is pulled out of the room through the vent.

Can you use the handbreak to stop a moving vehicle?,"It depends on the type of vehicle. For most vehicles, the handbrake is a parking brake and will not be able to stop the vehicle. For vehicles with a handbrake on the rear wheels, it can be used to slow the vehicle down, but it will not be able to stop the vehicle. For vehicles with a handbrake on the front wheels, it can be used to slow the vehicle down or stop it, but it is not recommended for use on public roads.","The short answer is yes. The handbrake is a brake, it will stop your car. The longer answer is: it may not be a good idea, depending on how the brake works. Your normal brakes are almost certainly *antilock brakes* (ABS) which automatically control the rate of braking and pulses the braking so that your wheels don't skid on the road. If you use your hand brake, it will most likely result in you losing control of the car and skidding across the road. That's pretty dangerous, as you can avoid a crash not only by braking but by turning away from the potential crash. Losing control is rarely a good thing, especially since you may not stop any quicker since your wheels are losing traction. Hand brakes work in a couple different ways, depending on the vehicle. Some of them are separate systems that bypass your normal brakes. Some of them, though, just lock the normal brakes down. In that case, using the hand brake won't stop you any faster, it will just avoid the ABS and make the whole thing more dangerous. Either way, you *can* use your hand brake to stop in an emergency, but you probably shouldn't if at all possible. The hand, parking, or emergency brake is usually, but not always, just your rear brakes actuated by a cable system instead of hydraulic fluid. This way it still works even if you lose all of your hydraulic fluid or if the master cylinder completely fails. But the brake pad or shoe the e-brake uses is usually the same one the normal system uses, so it won't add any stopping power if your normal brakes are working, and when used by itself it is much less effective because the front brakes do most of the stopping normally. You won't damage the emergency brake by using it occasionally, in fact it's recommended so the cables don't corrode in place, but there is another danger; The e-brake is designed to lock in place, possibly causing you to lose control of your car. To safely stop your vehicle with the emergency brake you have to remember to hold the button or other brake release so you can control how much braking force is applied and let up before the wheels lock up. This is also a good technique to use when starting from a stop on a steep hill with a manual transmission. Just keep the car from rolling back with the e-brake and release it as the clutch grabs. TL;DR - You *can* stop you car with it, but it won't be as good as the normal brakes and won't add anything if used at the same time. It should be used when parking on a steep hill or if your normal system fails, but you probably won't have fast enough reflexes to use it in a sudden emergency stop situation. The handbrake is just a metal cable connected to the brakes, it is not nearly as strong or efficient as the regular hydraulic brake system. It usually is only connect to the two rear wheels, unlike your normal brake pedal which is connected to all four. It may not apply braking force evenly to both rear wheels, which could cause your car to lock up the wheels and skid. Even under the best of conditions it will take a long time to slow the car to a stop. Take your car out to a parking lot that is empty and try it out. So yes, it technically will stop your car, but it takes a long time to do so and should only be used if your normal system has a complete failure.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 77.38, 'recall': 10.32, 'fmeasure': 18.21}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 27.71, 'recall': 3.66, 'fmeasure': 6.46}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 46.43, 'recall': 6.19, 'fmeasure': 10.92}}"

Ships also used lookouts who were not exposed to light so they are accustomed to the dark and can see objects using the stars and moon as lighting. Also a lantern would stick out quite much in a dark environment. often, they couldn't. ""2 ships passing in the night"" is an idiom specifically because it was so easy to miss another ship in the vast darkness of the ocean at night. those that were interested in being seen used lanterns. depending on what time in history and where, ships would have the lights laid out in patterns or with colors so you could tell what they were or which way they were facing (and thus moving) How old are we talking about?

"Why didn't old massive sailboats flip over, and why didn't their masts break being so far from CoM?",1. Sailboats have a much lower center of gravity than sailboats of the same size.

The old sailboats had a much higher center of gravity and were not as stable. 2. The old sailboats had a much larger sail area. This meant that the sailboats had a lot of wind resistance and were able to sail more slowly. This made them more stable because they were not as fast and did not have to be as maneuverable. 3.

The hull of a ship is typically loaded down with sand, stone, lead, etc to lower the waterline and stabilize the vessel. Much of the stonework you see in the streets and buildings of New Orleans was additional ship ballast quarried in europe and only shipped to the americas for the purpose of maintaining an even keel with its return voyage loaded down with the spoils of the new world. as for the masts snapping....they stood fine when they were trees covered in windcatching branches and leaves anchored to ground that did not give sway. The masts did not break because they were designed to be strong enough not to break. Lots of experimentation and calculation went into knowing/predicting the strength of a mast. As it progressed over the course of centuries, the art of mastmaking actually laid the foundation for modern [beam theory]( URL_1 ). If you want to get a bit technical, it all depends on the [stress]( URL_0 ) in the wood. If the stress gets too high, the wood snaps. ""Too high"" depends on the type of wood, so shipbuilders would try to find the strongest species of tree to make their masts out of. The stress in the wood then depends on three things: it depends linearly on the applied force (double force = double stress), linearly on the distance from the deck (twice as tall = double stress), and inversely with the *cube* of the diameter (twice as thick = 1/8th the stress). So you take all these factors and try to set them in balance: wood type, mast thickness, mast height, and expected wind force. If you can only find weak woods to build your ship out of, then you can only use the thickest ones as masts, or you can only have a short mast. And even if you have a sturdy mast of good wood, you have to avoid wind speeds you didn't design for - you can't sail into a hurricane, for example, because the mast wasn't designed to survive that! They did not have massive fins but they had lots of weights at the bottom of the hull to counteract the leaning caused by the wind pushing into the sails above. As for the mast breaking, wood is pretty strong and bends before it breaks, the sails further up on the mast were smaller to reduce the load and in strong wind some might need to be taken down to prevent the mast from snapping. There was more of a concern of uprooting the mast than breaking it. The mast was basically a whole tree that was very straight and strong and cured over several years. It was then built into the ship. The large concern in really bad weather was the mast breaking loose and tearing out of the hull. That was the weak point.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.29, 'recall': 20.12, 'fmeasure': 27.67}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.26, 'recall': 3.74, 'fmeasure': 5.15}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.29, 'recall': 10.58, 'fmeasure': 14.55}}"

Your engine undergoes a shit ton of design and instrumented testing during it's development. They use these special test ""cells"" that control every possible operating parameter, and they run these engines through the gambit, essentially every possible speed, load, and environmental and atmospheric condition, at $10k/hr, to develop the ""map"", if you can imagine - essentially a gigantic table of all the operating parameters for the engine. Based on what the car's sensors are telling it, the computer will select the ideal operating parameters in the map. These maps are conservative, for fuel economy, emissions, and engine reliability. Normally, when driving, you're doing so under ""closed-loop"", where sensors provide feedback and the map selection is adjusted, as I had suggested above. Under the right conditions, such as under load or demand (such as going full throttle), the map switches to ""open-loop"", where the computer basically disregards the sensors and selects a mapping that produces power at the expense of all else. There's also a shorter term ""learning"" (used, very, very loosely) system that will make adjustments beyond the map. So if your engine develops a misfire, or a hot spot, or you used some shitty fuel, or you bolted on a turbocharger without tuning the engine for it, this system can mitigate all these things. So this is the system that changes when you go into sport mode. You're using a different part of the map and the operating parameters are adjusted differently for performance, sacrificing all else, which is why you turn it on when you're going to use it, and turn it off when you're not. Never just run in sport mode just because, as it puts unnecessary wear on the engine, running at higher RPM for no reason, and wastes fuel. As I said, this map from the factory is conservative, and meant to work under all conditions, appropriate for mass production and a world wide market. A tuner can adjust this map to gain performance, fuel economy, and emissions, by making it specific to your region. They can, it doesn't mean they will - because the manufacturer spent $10k/hr to develop their map, and any Joe in their garage and with a hand unit from Autozone can call themselves a tuner.

"Why do fan and propeller blades often have different shapes and angles of attack? Why does the number of blades vary, shouldn't there be an optimal design?","Because the optimal design is dependent on the desired performance of the fan/propeller. Increasing the number of blades increases the amount of air that is moved, but also increases the drag. Increasing the angle of attack increases the thrust, but also increases the drag. The optimal design is different for different applications, and the optimal angle of attack is different for different speeds. This is why fan and propeller blades are designed differently, and the number of blades varies.","There *is* an optimal design... for any given purpose and set of operating conditions. The problem is that such things as expected air pressure, the speed at which it's moving forward (in the case of a propeller), the amount of driving power available, whether or not the fan is ducted, and various others, will change the optimal design. Hence, different designs for different purposes. > Why do fan and propeller blades often have different shapes and angles of attack? On all but the smallest airplanes, the angle of the propellers can be adjusted to match the speed, serving the same function as a transmission in a car. > Why does the number of blades vary, shouldn't there be an optimal design? For a given amount of power, few blades are better, but they have to be longer to get the same effect. The number of blades will be a tradeoff between space and efficiency. Well, I know that on AC condensers/heat pumps, the design of the fan blades can affect system performance. Different blade pitches and counts can have adverse affects on fan motor amperage by increasing or decreasing air resistance, refrigerant liquid (head) pressure by changing air flow across the coil, and compressor amperage by thusly changing the temperature and therefore pressure inside the condenser coil. With infinitely many applications, designs and manufacturers of equipment, it's impossible for there to be a universal fit More blades with low attack will have less buffeting, but more whoosh. Air flow and comfort tend to work against each other. The reason the angle of attack changes along the blade is because out towards the tip they're traveling faster and would exceed the speed at which they can bite the air if left the same along the whole blade. Conversely inside the angle of attack is steeper to make up for slower speeds. This doesn't really matter on household fans but on propellers it is imperative that the whole blade efficiently bites the air.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 80.0, 'recall': 19.1, 'fmeasure': 30.84}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 31.65, 'recall': 7.49, 'fmeasure': 12.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 43.75, 'recall': 10.45, 'fmeasure': 16.87}}"
What is the differences between airplanes and jets,"Airplanes are propelled by engines, which use fuel to generate thrust. The thrust is generated by pushing the air out of the back of the engine. Jets are similar to airplanes, but they use jet engines, which are powered by air. Instead of pushing air out of the back of the engine, the air is sucked in and then compressed. This compressed air is then heated, causing it to expand and increase in volume. This expansion generates thrust.","All jets are airplanes, not all airplanes are jets.

How does an already established city just build an underground subway system?,"The subway system is built underground, but it is not done in a single phase. It's done in phases, with the first phase being the construction of the subway tunnels. The subway tunnels are dug with the use of excavators and other heavy machinery.

It's built in phases. First the tunnels are dug, then the tracks are laid, then the trains are built. Once the trains are built the system is opened. The subway system is built in phases.

Older subways, like those in New York, are mostly cut-and-cover where they took existing roads, tore them up, built the subway tracks, and replaced the roadway above it. This was mostly done in the early 1900s most tunnels built like this are only a few feet below the streets. Nowadays cut-and-cover isn't used as much there is already a lot of existing infrastructure that needs to be moved (and identified as to what it even is) and it's politically unpopular because it's very disruptive to traffic and local businesses.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 24.46, 'recall': 23.78, 'fmeasure': 24.11}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.07, 'recall': 4.93, 'fmeasure': 5.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.11, 'recall': 14.69, 'fmeasure': 14.89}}"

","I got this guys :) I used to be a lead hardware engineer for the ISS Electrical Power System. URL_0 If you guys have any detailed questions feel free to ask me here (suggested by a user) URL_1 This is my first Reddit post , someone forwarded this to me. Ok . . . . so quick answer we have a SPG (Single Point Ground in the whole vehicle). The ISS is an interesting vehicle, we have 8 power channels, each with their own solar panels which is on primary power (160V DC), these primary channels get stepped down further to a very fine regulated secondary power 124.5V DC. Let's explore a single power channel. The primary power is regulated by SSUs (Sequential Shunt Units), we basically turn on or off individual strings to from a single power channels solar array until we regulate very fine at 160VDC. There are 1 for each power channel on ISS (8). Downstream of this ORU (On Orbit Replacement Unit) is a DCSU (Direct Current Switching Unit) , this DCSU acts as a giant circuit breaker and an availability to cross strap channels during emergencies and maintenance. There are 1 for each power channel on ISS (8). But . . . because the ISS is constantly going through solar events and the arrays are getting shaded we have a battery backup that ""Kicks In"" to regulate the 160Volts when the solar panels can't do it alone. These BCDU (Battery Charge Discharge Units) charge when excess energy is available and discharge when needed. There are a 3 PER power channel on ISS (24 in total) and multiple batteries that are used in these banks (the number depends if we are using new li-ion or older style batteries). These BCDUs attempt to regulate at at a lower voltage than the SSU. Because everything flows through these BCDUs (they are always charging or discharging) the batteries contain the positive and negative. Downstream further is the MBSU (Main Bus Switching Unit), this is the unit that ties all the BCDUs and DDCUs together (explaining next). Downstream further is the DDCUs (DC to DC Converter Units). These units will buck or boost voltage up or down to regulate 124.5V DC. You can NEVER tie two power channels together. You would have converters fighting eachother trying to keep up with regulation. They must always be isolated. But there is a common SPG (Single Point Ground) in the center of the vehicle at the Z1 Truss. Ok so the interesting question. The vehicle can travel in different orientations depending on what the operations of the vehicle are. Because of this as the solar arrays are adding drag to the vehicle or collecting electrons you are building a voltage potential at different points of the vehicle. A concern early on became well what happens as the vehicle travels through plasma clouds . . . . if there is a large voltage potential difference between the ISS and this cloud would ""Lightning"" strike and destroy the vehicles hull. . The PCU (Plama contactor Unit) was created that is housed near the Z1 truss. These units started out in full 24/7 operation at the beginning of the space station. They take a noble gas (Xenon), inject the excess electrons , and expel them from the vehicle, which keeps the charge of the ISS under control. It was determined at a later date that this lightning event was not credible to destroy the ISS hull, but it was enough to shock an astronaut during an EVA. Because of such we turn these ORUs on during EVA operations (There are 2 per ISS). Ask questions :) This is fun !! Ah, something I can answer. There are two aspects to this question: grounding of equipment with respect to the ISS, and grounding of the ISS with respect to the plasma environment in low earth orbit. All electrical equipment is chassis-grounded to the space station's metallic structure, which is then bonded to the negative side of the electrical bus at the Main Bus Switching Units, which are located on the center truss segment. These ground paths do not normally carry current, but they will private a return path in the event of a fault. That path will eventually return back to the solar arrays. With respect to the space environment, the ISS charging is measured using the Floating Potential Measurement Unit to determine the voltage between station and the plasma that surrounds it in orbit. I don't recall what normal readings are, but if it gets too high, or if they are doing an EVA for which the plasma potential is a problem (don't want to shock the crew members!), there is a device called the Plasma Contactor Unit, which emits a stream of ionized xenon gas to ""bond"" station structure to the plasma environment. So the frame is surely a common ""ground"". However, it can still build up an absolute charge. It's not readily observable by most meters and won't make current flow. But it can have unexpected effects, as observed in an electrostatic voltmeter with the 2 gold-foil leaves which repel each other when touching a DC charged conductor. I suppose you could build a high voltage DC generator and end it in a negatively charged needle to shed negative charge. But will that even work in a vacuum? And is there any way to shed a positive charge? Well, I suppose you could use a DC generator to charge some sort of mass and then eject the charged mass, but that seems wasteful and creates space-junk hazards. This was an interesting question. Makes me wonder what happens on resupply docking missions. Since both ships have their own chassis ground that could be many volts of potential difference. I read through the other thread and found that question asked a few times but never addressed. You could potentially be talking about 100's of volts of difference between the two ""grounds"" all being equalized at once when the 2 vessels touch. ""Ground"" does not always mean earth ground. The term is often used to refer to the zero voltage reference point of any electronic system. For big things like cars and the ISS, it is tied to the metal frame. You might have a misunderstanding of how electricity works. It seems like you think of batteries as a cup of electrons that you pour through a wire and other devices until it reaches the ground. That's not the case. Batteries or solar cells are pumps, not buckets. That's why circuits have to be a complete circuit; a closed loop. Batteries don't store electrons, they pump them through the circuit. The ground can't fill up with electrons because the battery continually pumps them through the circuit. ~~~Voltage doesn't matter so much as voltage differential. As long as the charge built up in a vehicle (like a car or a space station) is consistent through the chassis, nobody would know or care.~~~ Electric potential doesn't matter so much as voltage, which is the **difference** in electric potential. As long as the potential built up in a vehicle (like a car or a space station) is consistent throughout the chassis, nobody would know or care. When you measure the voltage of an electrical wire at 120VAC, that's gotta be measured relative to something. The second probe needs to touch something. If you want a good measurement, you'll touch it to something ""grounded"". But it doesn't matter whether it's connected to the literal ground. (The ground does need to be connected to the earth via a grounding rod in order for household power distribution systems to work, but that's because the earth is used as the return wire for completing the circuit.) In a similar way, how much air pressure is in your tires? Don't know; don't care. The only thing that matters is how much MORE pressure is in your tires than there is in the air around your tires. That's what a standard tire pressure gauge measures. If your tires are rated for 35 PSI, and you measure them at 35 PSI, that just means that they're 35 PSI higher than the air. (If you're at sea level, the air is around 15 PSI, so your tires are actually about 50 PSI. But the gauge won't show you that.) **Edit:** I changed ""that's what a pressure gauge measures"" to ""that's what a standard tire pressure gauge measures"" based on a comment by /u/CouchSoup **Note:** multiple people commented to point out that it's not a perfect analogy because, unlike pressure, voltage is only a meaningful concept when there is a reference. There is no absolute voltage like there is an absolute pressure. It's a little unintuitive for me still, so if you want to learn about the difference between voltage, electric potential, and charge, you will probably need a better teacher. :-/ **Edit:** I changed the first paragraph per suggestions by /u/mjk05d Is this different than how you ground electronics in cars? There is a defined 'ground' on any spacecraft. Normally you use the main structure, but it can be different. Obviously this ground will not be at 0V compared to the actual ground (which isn't chargeless anyway), but as long as everything is coupled to the same 'ground', it's fine, since voltages are potential differences anyway. Each subsystem in the spacecraft will have its own ground plane. These ground planes are in general all tied together, but not necessarily. Excess charge in one system can ruin other systems and often systems are shielded from each other in very complicated ways. This is one reason that space components are so much more expensive than standard electronics - even wires in close proximity to ground planes can cause interference that could completely ruin other systems (CCDs in particular are very sensitive to interference). The space environment is not nice to electronics (another reason they're so expensive, they need to be radiation hardened). There are all kinds of charging mechanisms, that affect the surface and interior of the spacecraft, sometimes in different ways depending even on its orientation. All this stuff means that designing spacecraft electronics is NOT EASY. ___________________________________________________________________________ [Source]( URL_0 ) ""Ground"" just refers to some arbitrary reference point that all of your electronics share. Usually you would use the metal frame of your vehicle, whether a car, boat, or spacecraft. Objects like cars or spacecraft can build up a net charge, but only by absorbing or losing charged particles. Normal electrical operation doesn't cause charge buildup. If too much charge buildup occurs, the object is more likely to attract particles of the opposite charge or lose particles of the built-up charge. So naturally, things tend to balance out. Most objects in space don't have very much of a charge density and are roughly neutral. In the extreme case, if you somehow got a ton of positive or negative charge in an object, it would just blow up in a Coulomb Explosion. But things would never get that far under normal circumstances. **International space station grounding manual**: URL_0 How do you ground an electrical system in a car that is isolated from the earth by rubber tires? By going back to the battery Here's the ELI5 answer: The frame is connected to the negative terminal of the batteries and or generator. That is how you ground DC vehicles. Can someone ELI5 this question to me? Literally don't have any idea what's going on When working on fighter jets in the Air Force i was taught that in the early days of aviation the planes would build up a HUGE static charge on the plane (which is effectively the ground for all electronics on the airframe). The planes would effectively kill people from the [1.21 gigawatts of] electricity stored on the aircraft frame. So they installed nifty little static dischargers on the wings that shed the static charge. URL_0 We also had to attach a grounding cable as soon as the plane landed before we touched the aircraft. Not sure if static dischargers work in space, but that's how it works on airframes that stay in the atmosphere! :) [I found this interesting powerpoint on Electrostatic Discharge]( URL_0 ) (ESD) on NASA's Website. I'm not going to pretend like I understand the entire document, but it looks like they use a 'Plasma Contactor Unit' which ""Essentially forces the collected electrons back into the environment in the form of charged particles."" (page 19). My understanding is this is mainly for ESD and not the electrical systems on board. Somehow they balance the electrical charge of the frame with a 'cloud' of plasma around the spacecraft. They detect the plasma with a Floating Potential Measurement Unit (FPMU) that was developed by Utah State University’s Space Dynamics Laboratory. Other than that, they use insulating materials to prevent ESD between astronauts and the craft during spacewalks. Also Interesting to note that the ISS has a primary system voltage of 160 VDC, secondary system of 120 VDC, and the russian system is 28 VDC. URL_0 I remembered my grandfather worked on this patent Not even close to an eli5 and deals with charge build up from the craft moving in space you are able to shed the charge into the surroundings as even at heights of the iss you still have some stuff around you and not a true vacumme However as long as the common ground is just that common it does not make much difference to onboard electronics as the potential remains the same TL: DR Voltage is realitive. Space can be considered a ground since it cant hold charge. But we use the hull as the ground. Theres a device that creates a low impedance connection to space called a plasma connector unit. You use the frame of the ISS as a common ground. All the voltage regulators and protection circuits regulate a safe voltage potential. The Hull filters out external noise since the electric field inside an enclosed conductor is zero if theres no charge inside. Capacitance is what allows a voltage to be ""held"" or be stored. Voltage is an electric field and capacitance is the ability to store an electric field. Voltage is essentially a ""charge pressure"". So if you have a small capacitance aka the frame of the ISS, its relatively easy to increase the pressure of charge by depositing positive charge carriers into it. The problem is that you need a higher voltage to deposit these charge carries otherwise the current well flow in the other direction. On the flip side space has no capacity to hold charge. It is a dielectric so an electric field can flow in it, but electrons well not be ""stay still"" inside space. They'll flow through it like a particule. Thus space is considered a ""ground"". The hull can create a low impedance connection to space called a plasma connector unit to short its excess charge to space.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 76.11, 'recall': 6.79, 'fmeasure': 12.47}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 27.11, 'recall': 2.41, 'fmeasure': 4.43}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 52.65, 'recall': 4.7, 'fmeasure': 8.63}}"
Why is it that airplane flight sticks are configured to roll left/right when you move the stick left/right instead of yaw left/right?,"The flight sticks are not actually connected to the plane. The plane controls the sticks, and the sticks control the plane. The reason for this is that the sticks are a simplified representation of the controls in the cockpit, and it's easier to fly the plane by moving the sticks than it is to move the actual controls. The sticks are connected to the plane by a series of cables and pulleys. The plane has a series of sensors that detect the movement of the sticks and translate that movement into the correct movement of the plane. This is how the plane knows which way to turn.","The rudder isn't there for mainly steering the plane, but more stabilizing it, which is part of the reason it is controlled by foot pedals, as opposed to the stick. The rudder helps prevent slips and skids in flight. The plane performs best when the airflow comes in directly in front of the wings, going straight back, maximizing lift. If the airflow starts coming in at an angle, performance drops so we utilize the rudder to correct that. It is useful in manuevers however, such as crosswind take-off and landing, where you want to straighten out the plane to the runway, as opposed to letting it go with the wind that it wants to do. Some single-engine propeller planes, it is necessary for climbing due to [P-factor]( URL_0 ), where then the plane is moving against the relative wind in a climb, one side of the propeller blades will get a higher angle of attack as opposed to the opposite blade, resulting in uneven thrust, unintentional yawing and decreased performance (RIGHT RUDDER!) Now for why the stick controls the ailerons on the wings (which causes the plane to roll) for turning is because the wing itself is there for generating lift. In straight and level flight, the lift force is always vertical, away from the ground and opposing the weight of the aircraft. When the plane rolls, the direction of lift changes to an angle, away from straight up and not in line with the weight. The plane's lift now at an angle, with a horizontal and vertical aspect, giving the power needed to start a turn. The traditional plane shape, along with the vertical stabilizer (where the rudder is), will cause the plane to adjust to the new direction, but won't be perfect, which is where the rudder comes back into play! When you adjust the ailerons by holding that turn with the stick, you control the rate of roll, not the angle of roll. Once you get to the angle you want, you can straighten out the stick (mostly) to hold that angle, but still have that turn, but no longer needing to apply force. If you turned with rudder only, which you can do, but highly impractical, you would have to hold that the whole time, which would be a pain. To sum up, rudder stabilizes the plane, ailerons and wing makes it roll and turn, which is why the stick controls the ailerons and foot pedals control the rudder.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 64.81, 'recall': 16.71, 'fmeasure': 26.57}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 17.76, 'recall': 4.55, 'fmeasure': 7.24}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.81, 'recall': 10.26, 'fmeasure': 16.32}}"

how come we couldn't use built up pressure to launch objects into space?,"Pressure is a force. The force of the pressure depends on the volume of the container. The larger the volume, the less pressure you can get. The smaller the volume, the more pressure you can get. For example, if you fill a balloon with air, you can get a lot of pressure in that balloon. If you fill a small bottle with air, you can get a lot of pressure in that bottle too. But if you fill a really really small bottle, you can get even more pressure in that bottle than the balloon. The pressure in a balloon is not that strong, but the pressure in a small bottle is really strong. So you can use the pressure in a small bottle to make things move. But it is not easy to make things move. The bottle has to be really small, and the things you want to move have to be really light.","It's actually an idea, called the Verne Gun after Jules Verne's classic book *From the Earth to the Moon* and like you said, the initial object would be fired into near earth before propulsion or other means are used. The problem is pesky G forces. In a rocked it's a somewhat slow build up, but firing shit out of a massive cannon is going from 0 to hypersonic instantly. This would likely turn any astronaut into fine paste while the rest of the craft is torn apart by the atmosphere resistance. Getting to *space* and getting to *orbit* are two completely different things. We've already built [a gun that can launch things into space]( URL_0 ), but they fall right back down. Staying in space means reaching a tangential (sideways) orbital velocity of 8000 m/s. By comparison, the muzzle velocity of that gun is only 2100 m/s, almost all of which is used to go up rather than sideways. Even railguns only reach up to about 3500 m/s. If you were to actually build a gun that could fire a projectile at 8000 m/s, it would immediately be destroyed by heat generated by friction with the atmosphere. We take advantage of this to slow spacecraft down from orbital velocity (reentry), but it doesn't destroy them because they have a heat shield and start out in the higher, thinner parts of the atmosphere and then descend into the thicker parts as they slow down. Therefore they're never subjected to enough heat to burn through the shield. But an object suddenly being accelerated to full orbital velocity in the thick lower atmosphere? Nothing can save it. Even if you assumed it to be indestructible, by the time it got to space it would have lost most of its velocity and wouldn't have achieved orbit. Of course, this is completely feasible on the moon. The velocity of a low lunar orbit is only about 1500 m/s and there's no atmosphere.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 42.31, 'recall': 19.41, 'fmeasure': 26.61}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.16, 'recall': 2.36, 'fmeasure': 3.24}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.15, 'recall': 9.71, 'fmeasure': 13.31}}"
Why are almost all boats white?," Certainly, I'm not an expert on this, but I can tell you why the general rule is that white is the preferred color for boats. It's mostly to do with visibility. Boats are not as big as buildings and cars, and they don't have lights on them. If you're out on the water and you see a white boat, it's much easier to spot than a darker colored boat. If you're on a dark colored boat and you see a white boat, it's also easier to spot. It's also worth noting that white is a color that reflects light, so it's easier to see than darker colors.","Ever notice that the line on the side of the road is white while it is yellow down the middle? That is because in fog it is vital to see the edge of the road. White shows up better in fog. White boats don't hit each other as much in fog, then. Most white boats are fiberglass. White fiberglass is the easiest / cheapest color to make and it doesn't fade. It also doesn't show scratches or dings as easy. Boats tend to last a lot longer than cars, so they need to look decent for a long time. White is one of the easiest colours to see against the blue background of the water and sky. When you're looking through binoculars for something kilometres away, a white boat is a lot easier to spot. URL_0 That article approaches it from the opposite direction, as they have a sailboat with a dark blue hull. In general, white is cheap and it reflects heat well, so most small civilian boats end up with a white deck if not a white hull. Commercial ships on the other hand tend to be other colors, including dark blue and red. So it's partly modern tradition, partly that white fiberglass is a thing and partly that a white deck doesn't get as hot in the blazing summer sun. A red object absorbs every colour except red right? Well it is well-known that white is best suited during hot days as it is a mix of a few colours. Therefore white rejects those colours, those colours composed by photons, at the origin of heat. Thus, white allows the boat to reject, not get assaulted by heat, in the middle of the ocean. White is a common colour for a lot of things (boats, trucks, vans, caravans & campers, buildings...) because it's cheap (because it's popular...), reflects heat so it stays cool, reflects light so resists UV damage (a major problem on the water as you're floating on a big mirror with zero shade), it's easy to see and it's neutral & inoffensive.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 68.1, 'recall': 22.19, 'fmeasure': 33.47}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 25.22, 'recall': 8.17, 'fmeasure': 12.34}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 37.93, 'recall': 12.36, 'fmeasure': 18.64}}"

"Why do most cars redline in the 6,250-6,500 RPM Range: never lower, rarely much higher?","This is due to the way the engine works. The engine has a ""powerband"" in which it makes the most power. This is the range in which the engine is most efficient at making power. This powerband is typically in the 4,000-6,000 RPM range. Engineers design the engine to make the most power at this range. If they were to design the engine to make power at a different range, the engine would be less efficient. The reason for this is the way the engine works. The engine works by compressing air and fuel into a small chamber. When the air/fuel mixture is ignited, it creates a small explosion. This explosion pushes the piston down, which turns the crankshaft. The crankshaft turns the wheels. The engine works best at the powerband because this is the range where the engine is most efficient. If the engine is asked to make power at a lower range, it is less efficient. If the engine is asked to make power at a higher range, it is less efficient. The engine is designed to work best at the powerband. The reason that most cars redline at 6,500 RPM is because the engineers design the engine to work best at this range. They design the engine to make the most power at this range.  ","Valvetrain dynamics. At high RPM, cost effective springs are ineffective and the valves can float between open and closed, or they can bounce. In performance applications, it's desirable to open the valves for long and wide, which is harder to do at higher speeds. F1 engines use pneumatics to close their valves, and cams to open them. Older fashioned pushrod valvetrains have additional mass and thus inertia, which is a limiting factor on engines of this type. And the faster an engine operates, the harder it is to breathe, putting a limit on how much torque (force) can be applied to the engine. At high speeds, air is thick, sticky, and bouncy. Friction torque increases with the square of the speed and power increases with the cube of the speed, which becomes waste heat. There are limits to engine geometry and materials to mitigate the effects of friction and dissipate the heat. There are material limits. Ferrari had a 22k RPM F1 engine before the limit was set to 18k RPM in 2008. They had a 25k RPM engine in development for that year. Typically, in your car's engine, at top RPM, the piston is traveling at the same speed as an F1 engine's piston in the middle of the stroke. But here's the rub, your engine has a stroke of, say 6"", and it does that 6k times a second? The F1 piston is going that speed in 1/2"" 18k times a second. Those are MASSIVE forces of acceleration being applied to that piston in either direction. That's why they make their parts super light weight and out of titanium and crazy shit, it's also why their engines are only good for 2 races, while yours has to run for a few hundred thousand miles. Finally, is combustion speed. Gasoline is a bad example because, Ferrari, 25k RPM, that's on gasoline - highly refined gasoline, but your car can run off the same stuff, it's not magic, it's not exotic, it's just precise. But the speed at which gasoline is the ultimate limiting factor. A better example is diesel. The fastest diesel engine there can ever be, effectively, is ~ 6k RPM. If you ran it faster, you'd be dumping still burning, still hot expanding gases, out the exhaust manifold. Ships burn bunker fuel, which is thicker than asphalt tar (and has to be heated to a liquid before being injected into the engine), and those things, with piston diameters measured in feet and strokes measured in yards, top out at only a couple hundred RPM.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.39, 'recall': 22.65, 'fmeasure': 30.0}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.95, 'recall': 2.52, 'fmeasure': 3.34}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.77, 'recall': 12.13, 'fmeasure': 16.06}}"
Why are the ceilings in supermarkets so high?,"Supermarkets are designed to maximize the amount of light in the store, while minimizing the amount of light reflected back into the store. White ceilings help with that, as they reflect light back into the store, and darker ceilings reflect less light back into the store. Light is a major factor in the store's design, as it can affect the temperature in the store, the energy consumption of the store, and the overall atmosphere of the store. In addition, white ceilings are also easier to clean, as they reflect dirt and dust more than darker ceilings.","1) To keep it from being claustrophobic. If it had short ceilings being in isles would feel like tunnels. 2) Heat management. There are dozens if not hundreds of people in the store at any given point in time. That produces a lot of body heat. It is cheaper for them to have high ceilings for that warm air to go to and be replaced by cooled air from the AC ducts that are set lower. Because they're usually set up in warehouse space. This is necessary because the back room has pallets stacked very high; it's easier to find and rent an existing warehouse than to have a custom two-tier building built with more space in the back and less height in the front. The buildings in which supermarkets are located are rarely purpose built to be supermarkets. Construction of commercial space is very, very generic. Concrete block walls support light gauge steel roof trusses and girders, which in turn support corrugated aluminium or steel roof panels. The tenants construct a drop ceiling at whatever height they desire, along with bulkheads and interior walls to give the desired shape. When the tenant leave, they [usually] rip out whatever they want to keep or are required to remove and then the next tenant moves in to a big empty cuboid space. Sometimes things get left behind. I once helped decommission an office/lab space and discovered a 30 year old 60 gallon air compressor resting on a wooden platform right above the ceiling of one fellow's office. In terms of grocery stores specifically (or any retail outlet), ballast lights and customers create a lot of heat. In order to keep the place comfortable, the ceilings are kept high. A high ceiling also opens the place up and makes it look more professional.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 50.52, 'recall': 16.01, 'fmeasure': 24.32}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.29, 'recall': 2.3, 'fmeasure': 3.49}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.9, 'recall': 9.48, 'fmeasure': 14.39}}"
How do trains make turns if their wheels spin at the same speed on both sides?,"Trains have two ""axles"" per wheel, so the wheels spin at the same speed, but the axles are in different positions. The train is pulled by two engines, each of which is connected to one axle. The engines are arranged so that the axles are in opposite directions. The engine on one side pushes the train to the right, while the engine on the other side pushes it to the left. The wheels on the two sides are connected by a ""bogie"" which is a special axle that can move up and down. The bogie is mounted on springs, so that the train can move up and down as it travels over the tracks. When the train needs to turn, the wheels on the side that is moving towards the turn are pushed together, and the wheels on the other side are pulled apart. This causes the bogie to move up and down, so that the train can turn. The train can also turn by changing the speed of the wheels on one side. If the train is going fast on one side, and slow on the other side, the wheels on the fast side will move in the direction that the train is turning. This causes the bogie to move in the opposite direction. This is called ""crab turning"". The bogie can also be turned by using a special mechanism that moves the axles in opposite directions.  ","Train wheels are actually conical. So, when a train turns, it slides to the larger part of the cone on the outside wheel and the smaller part on the inside wheel. That way the wheels still turn at the same rate, but their radii are different. As others have stated, some trains have a conical shape to the wheels that lets them rotate at different speeds. Others don't, and the wheels slide/slip creating a deafening screeching sound. It's especially loud when the train is travelling uphill and needs to exert a lot of force on the wheels. Source: am locomotive engineer Why do the wheels have to be conical? Isn't the train just following a track? Would that not turn it? E: whoever downvoted me can fuck off. I'm trying to learn shit by asking questions Here's a [gif]( URL_0 ) showing how. Basically the wheels are conical and the contact point with the rails change during a turn. A lot of light rail systems (BART, VTA, etc) don't have the conical wheels and whenever they make a turn or take a slightly curved parh the outer wheels start slipping and make a very annoying loud sound. In addition to the conical wheel explanation, any curve they go around is very slight and some slippage/difference in travel distance is very negligible. It's not like making a full lock turn in a car. Somewhat related: how do old school steam locomotives with like 4+ fixed axles go around corners? URL_0 As has been said its basically a cone so as it starts to go around a corner the radius of one wheel becomes larger than the other thus it begins to turn... strangely not all that unsimilar to how a motorcycle turns Great question. The wheels are actually conical, not cylindrical. The wheel diameter is larger as you get closer to the flange (flat part on the inside of the wheel). A good illustration is shown below. [Rail and wheel. ]( URL_0 ) When the train takes a curve, the flange of the wheel on the outside is pushed toward the rail, while the flange of the wheel on the inside is pulled away from the rail. This allows the wheels to spin at the same speed and travel different lengths of rail. Also worth pointing out that on a set of rails coming to a bend, one rail is slightly elevated more than the other to encourage a turn. This is called the ""cant"" of the rail. Radius of the curve to wide to make much a difference. Tracks on curves do get greater wear that straight line track.. Tight curves have oil boxes- rail greasers, as the radius is tighter.. but it dont account for much, but suppose to limit squeal (noise).. not sure it helps on wear .. Im not even sure they use it any more due to the environment laws.. I work for a railroad but Im just a paper shuffler. Ill ask tho.. Hey, I pass a rail yard every morning on my way to work and have a different question that maybe one of you can answer. How in the hell do locomotives turn around? I don't understand the question. Every wheeled vehicle from Conestoga wagons to the Model-T Ford made turns on wheels that moved on a fixed axle, didn't they? What's the issue? It's on tracks; where else is it gonna go? In Ukraine, street trains seem to lack conical shape, so they make loud rattling in series with ~0.5 sec interval. There are marks on the rails because this been going on for over 40 years. The interval is probably explained with wheels shaft tensions and micro-twists. [Edit - spelling] I inspect and repair freight trains. The body of a train car sits on a center pin in what is called the bowl (for it's bowl shape) this allows the trucks some wiggle room for when the track curves. The body is still in the bowl but the trucks can turn with the track allowing the wheels to stay on the rail.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 60.92, 'recall': 20.83, 'fmeasure': 31.05}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 16.46, 'recall': 5.61, 'fmeasure': 8.37}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.61, 'recall': 11.49, 'fmeasure': 17.13}}"
Why does my ABS get activated if I am braking on a bumpy road with my motorcycle even though the tyres are not locking?,"]( URL_0 ) & #x200B; It is the same reason a car's ABS gets activated if you are braking on a bumpy road. The sensors in the brake system are designed to detect when a wheel is locking up, and they use this information to decide whether or not to apply the brakes. If the wheel is locking up, it is because the tire is losing grip, and the ABS will apply the brakes to prevent the tire from losing even more grip. If the wheel is not locking up, it is because the tire is still gripping the road, and the ABS will not apply the brakes. & #x200B; The problem with this system is that it is not always able to tell the difference between a tire that is locked and one that is not locked. If the road is bumpy, the sensors may detect that the tire is locked when it is not, or it may detect that the tire is not locked when it is. & #x200B; This is why you sometimes see a motorcycle's ABS light up when you are braking on a bumpy road.  ",Because as you go over the bumps there are fractions of seconds where your tire doesn't have the full traction from the road.

How do missiles from fighter jets that are fired have such good accuracy? How can they change their direction in mid air by themselves and hit a moving target?,They don't change direction in mid air. They have a pre-set course and speed. The missile is guided by an on-board computer which uses radar to determine the distance to the target and adjusts the course to hit the target. The radar can be used to track the target and adjust the missile's speed and direction. The missile can also be guided by a human operator using the fighter jet's radar.,"There are a couple of ways missiles can be guided: - Through infrared tracking. The missile has a heat sensor on it that finds the massive amounts of heat put out by a jet engine and points the missile at it. - Through laser designation. The missile or a ground, sea, or aeroplane based laser points at the enemy craft and the missile has a camera that picks up on the very specific wavelength of the laser as it scatters off the enemy hull. When you see a fighter get a 'missile lock' on an enemy, this is usually what's its doing. - Radar tracking. Bounces the radar off the enemy to find it. These are augmented with onboard computer systems and software that help the missile figure out what's an enemy craft and what's the ground, reflections off clouds, friendly craft, etc. As for actually turning, missiles are lightweight and traveling at high speeds. Small adjuments to the fins create a high torque that can point the missile where it's aiming, generally much faster than a plane can maneuver with its much higher inertia (also a plane has to not kill its pilot with high G-force when maneuvering). Some missiles may use gimbaled thrusters, where the nozzle of the thruster can rotate to orientate the missile. Similarly, because a missile is mostly fuel and a small amount of payload/electronics and is rocket opposed to jet powered it can produce very high accelerations hence getting to very fast speeds quickly. Where the missile is pointing is determined through gyroscopes, accelerometers, and onboard cameras. These are all electronic and can give feedback many times a second to the fins allowing it to quickly change course. The big factor is the speed at which electronic systems operate, able to process information and make corrections much faster than any human controller ever could.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 57.89, 'recall': 14.06, 'fmeasure': 22.62}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.0, 'recall': 2.88, 'fmeasure': 4.65}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 32.89, 'recall': 7.99, 'fmeasure': 12.85}}"
Why have jet engines seemingly gotten wider and wider over the years?," URL_0 ) ^(_2 comments_) 

Answer:
I’m a retired Airbus engineer and I can tell you that the answer is “because we can”. Airbus and Boeing are both very well established companies and have a lot of experience. They know what they’re doing and they know how to do it well. The engine is the heaviest part of the aircraft and it’s also the most expensive. So they’re not going to make it wider unless it’s necessary. The reason they do make it wider is to increase thrust. The engine has to produce more thrust to counteract the drag of the aircraft. The engine is also made wider to allow more fuel to be burned. The engine is not only made wider, it’s also made more powerful. The engine is made more powerful by increasing the diameter of the fan and the compressor. The fan is the part that sucks in the air and the compressor is the part that compresses the air. The fan is made wider so that it can suck in more air. The compressor is made wider so that it can compress more air. The engine is made more powerful by increasing the number of blades. The engine is also made more powerful by increasing the speed of the fan and the compressor. The engine is made more powerful by increasing the temperature of the engine.  ","A modern jet engine is what is known as a turbofan. There is a gas generator core (what you would think as a ""jet engine"" - suck air, compress, burn fuel in it, use it to spin a turbine and use the remaining exhaust as reactive propulsion) that drives a large fan on the front, and most of the thrust is produced by the fan. The larger the fan, the higher the thrust at the same RPM (rotation speed). The slower the fan spins, the quieter it is. So a larger fan that spins slower would produce the same power as a smaller one that spins faster. Efficiency of the engine also depends on the size of the fan compared to the size of the core (known as bypass ratio), since the fan is more efficient as a propulsion at airliner cruise speed that the jet exhaust. The jet engine compresses the air, inject fuels, compresses mixture, ignites it and exhausts the gas at an accelerated speed through an exit nozzle. A wider jet engine can have a larger air intake and larger forces can be exerted by the engine to accelerate the plane at a faster rate. It's owing largely to improved materials and manufacturing as these can survive much higher forces and temperatures.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 39.57, 'recall': 43.26, 'fmeasure': 41.33}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.26, 'recall': 7.94, 'fmeasure': 7.59}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.15, 'recall': 20.93, 'fmeasure': 20.0}}"
Why do most cars need a transmission,"This is a very common behavior in many animals. There are a few reasons why this is the case. Firstly, it is a form of self-cleaning. By eating their own feces, they remove the bacteria that are present in their own waste. This is important because many of the bacteria that are present in feces can cause illness. Secondly, it is a form of pest control. Many animals that eat their own feces are also known to eat insects that are present in their own waste. This helps to control the population of insects that are present in their own environment. Finally, it is a form of nutrition. Many animals that eat their own feces are also known to eat other plants or animals that are present in their own waste. This helps to supplement their diet and provide them with extra nutrients.","Power, in engine terms, has two factors Torque - how hard you're pushing RPM - how fast you're spinning Gears in transmissions like you take a high speed low torque input and make a high torque low speed output, perfect for getting a car moving. You can also take a medium torque, medium speed input and make a high speed low torque output, perfect for cruising at highway speeds If you don't have a transmission then the speed of the engine is always the same proportion of the speed of the wheels. This will result in you either having great acceleration but minimal top speed or terrible acceleration and good top speed. If you put in a fixed gear ratio and choose that your idle RPM (~1000 RPM) should result in ~5MPH so you can travel slowly, then your red line RPM(~6500 RPM) will only get you 32.5 MPH. If you decide you want to be able to hit 80 MPH without quite redlining(~5000 RPM) then your idle RPM will push you at 16 MPH, if you try to go any slower than that you'll stall the engine. An engine generates more power as the RPMs go up so in our example above the first car will have slow acceleration up to about 15 MPH and then it'll really pick up until it tops out around 33 MPH. The second car will struggle to get off the line and likely require a push to get going, then give you very poor acceleration up to about 50 MPH Electric motors don't need multigear transmissions because they have full torque at 0 RPM and a much flatter power curve than a combustion engine, and no minimum RPM like your car.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 24.31, 'recall': 11.86, 'fmeasure': 15.95}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.7, 'recall': 0.34, 'fmeasure': 0.46}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.89, 'recall': 6.78, 'fmeasure': 9.11}}"

How do new houses hook up to existing sewage and water lines without disrupting service or spewing liquids?,> How do new houses hook up to existing sewage and water lines without disrupting service or spewing liquids? The sewage is usually hooked up to the main line in the street and the water is hooked up to the main line in the street. The sewage is usually hooked up to the main line in the street and the water is hooked up to the main line in the street.,"Residential sewer is pretty much all gravity main (a pipe that relies on gravity to take wastewater to a larger gravity system that might join several neighborhoods and in most cases ends up at a pump station). You can trench to the main and tie in by drilling a hole and fitting a saddle while still in operation. Water service is largely the same process but done under pressure. The process is called hot tapping a main. A special drill rig is used that fits through a saddle and valve. The residual pressure from the pipe pushes out any debris generated by the drilling process and (ideally) the line would be flushed at the end of line blowoff after drilling to ensure that this is true. Demo here: URL_0 Engineer working in the drinking water industry here. The answer to water and sewer are separate. Water: ""Tapping"" machines insert a new valve (typically 3/4""-1"" diameter for residential) into an existing water main while it's live, and the valve is installed in such a way that it is closed when the installation machine is removed, so water doesn't go everywhere. The new valve threads right into the existing water main, which is typically made of iron, though there are other materials (plastic, concrete) used throughout the country. These machines also exist for larger buildings, which sometimes require 4-8"" connections for domestic water and sprinkler systems, but this process is much more expensive when you get to these sizes. In both cases, since the valves are installed closed, the contractor can then run the water pipe into the building and connect to the plumbing, then only when everything is hooked up open the new valve. Sewer: Sewer mains are generally gravity flow, and are not full. As a result, you can often cut a hole in the top 3/4 of the pipe, install a new pipe to form a T or Y, and then seal up the hole without too much mess. Sewer and water guy here. Finally a question I can answer! Sewer mains are gravity operated, so you can cut a hole into the top of the pipe and no liquid will escape. Sewer mains are made of various materials, from plastic to clay to concrete, but all are tapped the same way. We usually dig down to expose the main, and cut a hole in it using a cordless drill and a 4"" diameter hole saw. Then a rubber boot is placed on the main, and fastened using metal bands that wrap around and tighten with a screwdriver bit. We coat the pipe and the rubber boot with a type of cement to prevent roots penetrating into the pipe and causing blockages. The boot has a mouth on it that accepts a new 4"" plastic line that runs to the new house. It's inserted into the boot, and tightened using the same style metal band clamps. Water mains are a different process. It really depends on the material the main is made from. For cast iron of ductile iron mains, we have a ""tapping machine"" that drills a hole and inserts a new tap while the main is still under pressure. The device is made of brass. We place a rubber ring on the pipe, and sit the machine on it. A chain wraps around the pipe and connects to both sides of the device. We tighten two nuts to put tension on the chain. They have to be pretty tight so the rubber ring compresses enough against the wall of the pipe to prevent water from blowing out under pressure. The device is a long tube with a flap halfway down inside, that can be opened or closed with a lever on the outside. The cap that fits on the end of the tube has a metal shaft on it that accepts a special drill bit. The bit drills a hole, then cuts threads in the hole so it will accept the new tap. The cap/shaft/drill bit assembly is slid into the shaft and tightened into place. The shaft can be slid in and out without removing the cap. A large drill is attached to the end of the shaft, and the tapping process begins. The drill is geared very low. It doesn't spin fast, but has a lot of power. The tapping device has an arm that flips up and turns slowly with the drill shaft. The arm applies downward force so the bit cuts faster. Once the new hole is drilled and tapped, the drill is removed and a ratchet wrench is placed on the shaft to back the bit out by hand. The tapping device arm is still holding the shaft, because without it, once the bit is backed out of the threads, the water pressure will force the shaft out with an extreme amount of force that could possibly impale or otherwise seriously injure the man holding it. Once the bit is screwed out, the tapping device's arm is removed and the shaft is pulled out as far as it can go. This is where the flap inside the tube comes in handy. With the shaft retracted, you pull the lever to close the flap, and release the pressure from the end of the tube. The water pressure holds the flap closed, allowing us to remove the cap/shaft assembly. We remove the drill bit from the end of the shaft, and replace it with the new shutoff. The shutoff is a brass fitting that has one end threaded so it screws into the pipe wall, and is made to accept a piece of pipe in the other end. The water can be shutoff by turning a small flat piece on the side with a wrench. A metal cap is screwed onto the shutoff, and it attached to the tapping machine shaft. The shaft/cap assembly is placed back in the tube, and the flap is opened allowing the water to pressurize it again. Once the pressure is equalized, the flap is opened all the way. The shaft is pushed down until the threads of the shutoff touch the hole we drilled and tapped earlier. The shaft is turned with the ratchet wrench until the shutoff is tightened in the hole securely. With the shutoff in the hole, the tapping device can be removed from the pipe. We take a wrench and tighten the shutoff some more if it's too loose or leaking. We attach a pipe to it and connect the other end to the customer's new water meter, completing the new water service. If the main is plastic, the process is slightly different. Plastic pipe is too thin and weak to screw a tap directly into it. A saddle must be used. A saddle is a metal fitting that has a rubber ring on the surface that mates with the pipe. It has metal clamps that go around the pipe and bolt to the saddle. Once these are tightened in place, a shutoff is threaded into the saddle. The shutoff is turned to the ""open"" position and a tapping machine similar to the kind used on larger pipes is threaded onto the shutoff. The tapping machine has a shaft with a drill bit on the end inside it. A drill is attached to the end of the shaft, and a hole is drilled into the plastic pipe, inside the saddle. Once a hole is drilled, the shaft is retracted, and the shutoff is turned to the closed position. The tapping machine is removed from the shutoff, and a pipe is attached and ran to the new meter. These methods of tapping a pipe ""hot"" allow new services to be added without shutting down the main at all. Edit: thanks for the gold! I posted this before bed last night. I'm vacationing in Indiana and we're in the middle of nowhere. I have no internet at the rental cabin, so I'm on mobile. I also have no cell phone service inside the cabin and very little outside. People probably think I'm batshit crazy, walking around in the front yard holding my phone up in the air. I'll answer as best as I can. Lots of people asked about metal shavings getting in the main when tapping. I can't say for sure that none get in there, but most stay inside the tube. There's no water in the tube until the drill bit punctures the main. When the water floods the tube, the shavings get sprayed away from the hole. In order for the water in the tube to get back into the main, the pressure inside the tube would have to be greater than inside the main. That doesn't happen, so I would think it all stays in the tube. If a stray metal shard did find its way into the main, it would probably just settle to the bottom. If it made it into your service line, it would get caught by the plastic mesh screen inside the water meter. If it made it past that, it would get caught in the strainer of your faucet. For it to make it into your cup of tea, there would have to be some kind of Final Destination type shit going on. Edit2: [Here]( URL_0 ) is the small tapping machine. You can see a saddle in the picture around the plastic pipe. [And here]( URL_1 ) is a video of a larger tapping machine that is vaguely similar to the one I use. The one I use has been at our company since the 1970s and I can't seem to find an identical one online, but you'll get the idea. /u/toddlikesbikes has service lines covered, but I figured I might as well mention how water and sewer main construction is done. When water mains are rebuilt, there's really no choice but to shut down the main since they are pressurized unless you are hot tapping as has already been mentioned (you can do it with big mains too). That doesn't mean that everybody serviced by the main will go without water for the duration of construction though. For a planned, lengthy shutdown of a main, the construction crew will run temporary water lines to each house. These smaller lines (usually just 2-4"" PVC) are hooked up to a fire hydrant outside the work area, and ran above ground through the yards of the homes. Then, a hose is hooked up to the house somewhere, usually the garden hose spigot on the exterior of the home, and the main water supply valve is closed. This allows the homes to continue receiving water service as usual. Sewer mains cannot be ""shut off"" because they are gravity fed. When a run of sewer main is to be replaced, the crew will go to a manhole upstream of the work and drop a hose into the manhole. Then, they will hook it up to a big trash pump, and run more hose to another manhole downstream of the work. Then, they turn the pump on and dam the outlet of the upstream manhole with sandbags and wait for the main to drain. Since there will usually be sewer services within the project area, flow won't be completely eliminated, but the amount of sewage coming out of just a few houses is negligible. This isn't what you asked exactly but I thought you might find it interesting as well. Intermittent valves that can shut off particular stretches of pipe for service. There may be a temporary disruption in service (particularly with a water line), but it is pretty infrequent that someone is running new water lines from the main in an established neighborhood. Additionally, when a new line is installed for a house, a separate valve is installed at the same time that can isolate their water line from their neighbors' in case they need to do a repair, or can't pay their bills because they spent all their money on coke and their wife left them with his kid and my water got shut off. On the sewer side it's worth mentioning that when the mainline is installed they will often also install pre-connected taps that are plugged off but ready for future service connections. Give the question about the sewer a bit more thought - ""what would happen if a sewer line were pressurized?"" The first time someone flushes a toilet, they get a big, wet, nasty surprise. Now, such accidents have happened on submarines, where the waste system has to be pressurized in order to dump the waste into the sea. The sailor who ignores the warning signs put in place when the system is pressurized gets to spend the next 8 hours cleaning the head. Hot tapping. URL_2 It is even more interesting with a natural gas pipeline. With smaller pipes they weld a flange on a mains pipe, install an open valve on the flange, insert drill through the open valve, punch the hole, remove the drill (punch rod) and close the valve. With large diameter gas pipelines they weld a piece of pipe with flange (to create a T junction) and then use torch to cut the hole in the mains line. Then they install a valve and close it. On the city mains this might be interesting sight, with 6 meter flames during welding/cutting live gas pipe. Or at least used to be, like 50 years ago. See URL_1 Nowadays, there are fancy systems, like this one URL_0 Usually if it's in a area that's already developed they can do a hot tap while the line is still on and have minimal water spraying. With sewers similar concept the drill into the side and but a saddle on it most sewer aren't even full when in service so there is little mess. Where I come from we have a dense population but a significant proportion of people still are not connected to the main drain. They have cess pits to take toilet waste which are pumped out by government services as and when necessary. Septic tanks or other bio-systems are not allowed on the island as a significant proportion of the land is used for potable water capture. To answer OP's question in regard to my locality, when a main drain is run under a road as the government lays more services, individuals bordering the new pipe may choose to pay to connect to the sewer via a private contractor as any pipe on their land is their responsibility. The team installing the main drain under the road will leave connection points adjacent to any property along its route and cap this pipe off ready for future connection. If the householder wishes to keep using their cess pit for the time being they can do and connect to the main at a later date. The last connection point I connected a house to was 10 feet below road level. I ran new 4"" below ground waste pipe from their house to the boundary with the road. At that point my trench was already 3 feet below ground. I got the main drain pipe plan from the government office and dug down 10 feet and found the capped off main connection tee where the plan said it would be. I installed something called an interceptor (a water trap like a toilet U-bend) and a vent near this connection and also an inspection chamber for the interceptor. Uncapped the tee on the main drain and connected my 4 inch pipe to it. The main drain is only a 1/4 full with fluid (think of a swimming pool flume ride but with turds in it instead of people) and the connection is near the top of the pipe so you can open it up without getting covered in poop. That's how we connect to sewers where I live anyway. Rain water is gravity piped into soakaways - pits dug in the ground, filled with irregular rubble historically but today [plastic crates]( URL_0 ) are used to create area for water to drain. They actually have competitions at the state water/wastewater operators convention where they do wet taps on pressurized sections of pipe. They're judged on time, quality of work and safety. They can do a tap and hook up a meter in just a few minutes. There's also a thing called a wet tap. A sleeve with gaskets is placed over the main while the tap is made. This allows the tie in to be made without closing a valve and shutting down service to the line. Plumber here. All the answers are great and shit but not many rural people use that shit. You get a black plastic pipeholder, wrap it around the pipe. These pipeholders have one side which you can attach a pipe to. And they are very easy to put valves on. So, we get the valve ready, get an iron rod blazing and push it through the water system's pipe, when the water comes out, you quickly connect the valve to the pipeholder. You get a bit wet but not a problem $ saved. Waste lines arnt under pressure so it's not a big deal. Doing a hot tap on live water lines are pretty cool actually... at least mechanical piping is im not sure how cool residential water Hook ups are. Go on YouTube and watch a couple videos. Also look up ""hot tap natural gas line."" It's badass.. Union pipefitter Sewage - insert bung. Risk is more of gas than liquids. Water - speacially designed tap in that creates overlapping seal before hole is drilled into main. Valves. Same way you can isolate your apartment or house from mains to service them. Also, it is possible to ""hot tap"" into piping if there isn't a valve. Basically, you weld a stub in, hook up a device to the stub in and the device will drill the pipe and install a valve, all without leaking. In a big subdevelopment, the infrastructure for water/sewer is already there, they attach the new house then open the right valves and all is working. In rural homes, they often build brand new water well/pump, and a septic system on the property, no outside connections. Major city infrastructure can be isolated prior to construction, then once connections are made, they open all the taps without contaminating any of the surrounding buildings. Sewer, for the most part, is an open system. Not under pressure. There are some lines under pressure, but most are only gravity fed. Main pipe runs down the bottom of a manhole, new house connection goes half way up/near the top. No-where near the sewer running down the lower pipe. Water, there are screw 'taps' you can 'break into' existing lines. For major works, they just turn the water off to that particular line. There are two main types services that need to be hooked up. Water and Sanitary sewer. Somebody in the comments above talked Water services and about tapping into the pressure main with a special machine, that's how that's done. As for the sanitary sewer, most answers I have seen don't address connecting a new sewer into an existing active sewer main. This is usually done by finding there nearest 'upstream' manhole, sending a person down that hole (with all sorts of safety equipment for sewer gases which will kill you before you can get out of that hole) and that person will plug up the sewer pipe that is flowing downstream. They then stick a trash pump down the hole and bypass pump to the 'downstream' manhole. They will then excavate for the tie in, cut the sewer main, add in the Y connection and attach the pipe from your house there. Once it's all connected and back filled, some goes down the hole again and unplugs the upstream manhole.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 90.0, 'recall': 1.87, 'fmeasure': 3.65}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 43.48, 'recall': 0.89, 'fmeasure': 1.74}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 70.0, 'recall': 1.45, 'fmeasure': 2.84}}"
How do home coffee makers move water from tank to pot without a pump?,"գերենATED LONG ANSWER: There are several ways to do this, depending on the type of coffee maker. One of the most common is to use a vacuum system. The water tank is typically sealed, and there is a hole in the bottom of the tank. When the coffee maker is turned on, the water is released from the tank into the boiler, and then into the coffee grounds. The pressure of the water is higher than the pressure in the tank, so the water flows into the tank. The pressure in the tank is lower than the pressure in the boiler, so the water flows out of the boiler and into the coffee grounds. This is the same principle as how a vacuum cleaner works. The vacuum cleaner has a sealed container that is connected to the vacuum motor. The motor creates a vacuum, which pulls the air into the container. The container has a hole in the bottom, so the air flows out of the container and into the vacuum cleaner. In the same way, the coffee maker has a sealed container that is connected to the boiler. The boiler creates a vacuum, which pulls the water out of the tank and into the boiler. The boiler has a hole in the bottom, so the water flows out of the boiler and into the coffee grounds.  ","There is a one-way valve at the bottom that only allows water to travel out towards the top. The water moves through the valve and is heated. As it heats up, it expands, and some of it turns to steam, creating pressure. Because of the one-way valve, the pressure pushes the water up the tube where it will eventually spill over the coffee grounds. Between the slight cooling and rising out of the way, the pressure is equalized on both sides of the valve, allowing more water to pass through from the reservoir to the heating element. Again, the water is heated, expanding, and pushing against the one-way valve, closing it and expanding upwards. [Here is a wonderful video explaining it]( URL_0 ). The power of boiling! (and little valves!) The flat plate that the carafe sits on is a heating element with two jobs. One is to keep the coffee that's been made hot. The more important is to heat the water from the tank so it can actually make the coffee. Water flows through a little tube to the heating elements. The heating elements are very hot (source: ouch!) and cause the water to boil. When that happens, the water turns to steam and expands. There's a little valve to keep the water from pushing back on the water in the tank. Instead, the only way for it to go is up to the basket of coffee grounds, where it turns ground-up toasted plant matter into liquid awesome. So, no, there's no pump, just physics.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.93, 'recall': 38.64, 'fmeasure': 41.55}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.04, 'recall': 12.93, 'fmeasure': 13.91}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.43, 'recall': 22.73, 'fmeasure': 24.44}}"
"Passenger jet thrust reversers. If the air coming in is equal to the air being pushed out, wouldn't they both cancel eachother out?","They do. That's why they don't really need to be used.

Why is it that when I pump my tank full of gas the nozzle will shut off right when it's full but when I prepay it crawls through the last .50 cents or so worth of gas at an agonizingly slow pace?,"It's to prevent fraud. Gas stations are not allowed to fill up a tank more than 90% full. If you were to pay for a full tank, but the gas station was able to fill it more than 90%, they would be able to charge you for the extra gas. The nozzle will shut off once it reaches the 90% mark.","Because the pump has to slow down if it wants to stop on a precise, to-the-cent amount, which is what happens when you pre-pay. When you just fill up your tank, the pump isn't trying to land on a specific cent amount, so it can just stop whenever the air backpressure from inside the tank indicates that it's almost full. Gasoline and diesel pump nozzles are designed to ensure that the air displaced from the fuel tank flows back through the nozzle itself. When this airflow abates, a valve on the nozzle closes and fuel flow is cut off; this prevents a tank from overflowing. When a predetermined maximum amount of fuel is to be dispensed, the pump needs to slow down to ensure that no more than the predetermined amount of fuel is actually dispensed. To be put this in mechanical terms, the nozzle has a valve that closes when it senses that the tank is full. When the valve closes, the hose pressure rises and the pump shuts off. When the tank is not full, the pump must slow down in order to drop the hose pressure, which causes the valve to close once the pressure drops below a calibrated point.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 53.23, 'recall': 15.87, 'fmeasure': 24.44}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.2, 'recall': 2.42, 'fmeasure': 3.73}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.87, 'recall': 10.1, 'fmeasure': 15.56}}"

Why aren't we supposed to top off our gas at the gas station?,"Because when gas was first discovered, it was hard to measure. So it was just easier to sell by weight. It's a lot easier to measure weight than volume. For instance, if you want to know how much gas is in a can, you can just weigh it. If you want to know how much gas is in a tank, you have to measure the volume of the tank. The volume of a tank is much harder to measure accurately. Gas is sold by weight because it is easier to measure the weight of a tank full of gas than the volume of the tank. You can use a scale to measure the weight of a tank of gas. You have to measure the volume of the tank and then calculate how much gas is in it. It's much easier to measure the weight of a tank of gas than the volume of the tank. The reason it is easier to measure the weight of a tank of gas is because it is a physical property of the gas. It is a measure of how much mass the gas has. Gas is a physical substance, and it has a weight. It is not a liquid, and it is not a gas, so it is not measured by volume. It is measured by weight.  ","There are a few reasons, but the most like you're five answer is so that you don't spill. There's a little tube inside the big nozzle that can tell when gas reaches the end of the tube. That last bit of tube accounts to a few ounces (or milliliters) and really won't add much to your tank or the mileage you expect. When you stick the nozzle into the gas hole (I'm sure that's what it's called) it only goes on a little (just the tip), and isn't actually in your tank (unless you're on a motorcycle, filling a can, or maybe a small motor), so you've already filled the tank and all that's left is the gas filling tube (or gas colon, if you will). However, if the gas flows freely for just a few moments while you realize the blunder you just made, it can amount to lots... Including running down the side of the vehicle, leaving a flammable puddle, and possibly getting on your clothes or person. It's full of waste, environmental icky, and potential fire.

"Why do Harley Davidson engines painted black stay cooler than a stock non painted engine, how does this not cause the engine to overheat?"," Cooling is a function of convection. The color black is more efficient at absorbing solar radiation, and converting it to heat than white. If you put a black and white box outside in the sun, the black box will get hotter faster. The black engine will have a lower temperature than the white engine. There is a reason that black cars are more popular in hot climates. This is not just a matter of the color, it is also the surface finish. A smooth surface will absorb more heat than a rough one. The engine block and heads of a Harley Davidson engine are very rough. The engine is designed to be used in the rain. The rough surface of the engine helps to shed water, but it also helps to shed heat. A smooth engine will heat up faster than a rough one. If you are worried about overheating, you can add a radiator fan to your Harley.","where is the support that a black engine stays cooler? Google turns up nothing but maybe Im searching wrong. The coating is powder coating, not paint, small difference, but we can be fairly certain that powdercoating to a high gloss finish is not improving the engines cooling. Not that its devastating, just... not helping. But if you have evidence to the contrary, Id love to read it. White reflects light the best, emits heat the worst. Black reflects light the worst, emits heat the best. That's why on the Space Shuttle, there's a black side and a white side. The black side is the part that is subject to re-entry heating, and needed to emit heat to cool down. The white part was pointed towards the sun when in orbit so as to reduce the absorption of light and infra-red to make sure there wasn't so much heating that the vehicle became too hot to live in. Silver is in the same boat as white. It reflects light well, and emits poorly. Edit: I just want to make it very clear that that I am just explaining how colour effects cooling. I'm skeptical as to whether it makes a difference in the specific case OP mentioned. Heck, maybe a thin layer of black paint is actually a slightly better insulator leading to less transfer of heat to air, canceling out any effect, if not worse. It emits heat better by radiation, but i can't see how it would work to actually cool the engine. See all the louvres on the cylinders are there to increase surface area to aid cooling by convection, i.e air passing over the hot engine. A paint layer will act as insulation against convective cooling which is undoubtedly the largest factor at speed. Radiative cooling will have an effect, but i doubt it is very significant unless you are stationary anyway.

Why do some lamps click 4 times?,"There are two different types of dimmers, magnetic and electronic. Magnetic dimmers use a magnetic field to control the amount of current to the bulb.

The clicking is caused by the dimmer trying to maintain a constant voltage drop, but the resistor is reducing the voltage, so the dimmer is trying to increase the current. The clicking is the dimmer trying to increase the current, but it can't because the resistor is reducing the voltage.

It is determined by a number of factors: type of cartridge fired, inherent precision of the weapon, and volume of fire delivered. Basically, in order to pull off that shot, that marksman had to be both extremely skilled and lucky. You **can** hit a target beyond the effective range, but it is pass the point of reasonable certainty. So there's two simple answers to this question: ""Effective range"" is a metric that is used to explain the standard, conceivable distance that adequately trained, basic personnel can use the weapon system from. Anything beyond that is considered a distance that a specially trained ""operator"" can shoot from. And honestly, you really don't need to hit a vital organ when you're slinging a .50 caliber bullet at someone. Even if you're a mile away, that round will shred you to pieces. You do not need to be accurate within an inch to kill someone when you're firing that round. So a kill is attained merely by hitting a target the size of a military aged male. The problem you're facing is that the firing range which you are referring to is what is called an ""effective range"". It is within the effective range that the weapon can be considered effective, being suitably accurate at that range in order to reliably hit targets at that range. However, skilled users can potentially use a weapon at ranges beyond the established effective range (albeit at great difficulty). They would do this by accounting very precisely for factors like wind.

"Why, when building robotic hands, can't we build an exact copy of the human hand only using mechanical parts?","It's not a matter of ""can't"" or ""can"", it's a matter of ""why"". The human hand is a highly specialized organ that has evolved over millions of years. It's not just a matter of having the right number of fingers, or having the right length and shape of fingers, but also the way the muscles work, the way the nerves are structured, the way the joints are structured, and so on. There's a lot of things that make the human hand work the way it does, and trying to replicate all of that with a robotic hand is a very difficult task. You can build a robotic hand that can do some of the things the human hand can do, but it will be very different. It will be less precise, it will be less dexterous, it will be less able to grip objects, and it will be less able to perform tasks that require a high degree of precision.","I'm a grad student working on some related this research in replicating biological systems as machines. There have actually been some pretty good attempts at mechanical human hands, but trying to make a soft fleshy part out of rigid components is never going to be exact. We can use tiny motors to control the wrists and fingers, but then you end up with awkward heaviness wherever the motors are sitting. You can put tactile sensors to detect finger touches, or encoders to keep track of joint positions, but with current tech you cant get enough accuracy to identify the shape or texture of an object you're holding, how hard your grip is, is the object warm, is it slipping from your grasp, etc. Is the hand waterproof? Does it sweat to cool itself? If we are really going for an ""exact copy"" we are a long way off. My research is is in what we call ""soft robotics."" In general, we try to replicate some of the functions of living tissue in such a way that the final product is soft, flexible, stretchable, damage resistant, and so on. We try to develop parts so that all the functionality you need is just built into the material itself. I mean, think of all the things just your skin does. Instead of motors we develop artificial muscles out of different materials so they can be made into bundles of controllable filament. Instead of copper wires we use conductive fabric or liquid metal in tiny tubes. Instead of ratchets and mechanical stops, we use stiffening and softening fibers to hold the grip in place. Eventually we hope to weave all these together in a sort of ""smart fabric"" that will resemble a living system at least a little bit.

How does a small amount of Spandex woven into a non-stretchable fabric like cotton give the entire garment stretch ability?,"It is not a matter of the spandex being so fine that it spreads the fabric thin, it is a matter of the spandex being woven into the fabric. Think of it as a mesh of threads that are woven together. The spandex is one of those threads. If you think of the fabric as a sponge, the spandex is a sponge that is spread out in a mesh. When you stretch the sponge, the spandex fibers stretch, but the rest of the fabric does not. The fabric is still woven in a mesh, but the spandex fibers are woven in a mesh that is thinner than the rest of the fabric. When you stretch the fabric, the spandex fibers stretch, and the rest of the fabric stretches along with them. The spandex fibers are very thin, so they don't take up a lot of space. The rest of the fabric is thicker, so it takes up more space. Because the spandex fibers are so thin, they can stretch more than the rest of the fabric. This is why spandex is used in clothing that needs to stretch. It is also why spandex clothing is usually more expensive.  ","It's not really that the spandex is allowing the cotton to become more stretchy, it's that the spandex (until it is stretched) is retaining the tight/original shape of the garment. Instead of thinking of a garment-with-spandex vs an equally tight garment-without spandex, think instead of a garment-with-spanex against a looser garment-without-spandex. The looser garment is roughly as loose as the maximum stretch of the 'garment-with-spandex.' The addition of the spandex keeps the garment/weave tight. You can easily stretch most knit cotton clothing. The problem is that it has limited elasticity, so it will mostly stay stretched. The elastic spandex mixed in causes the fabric to return to its original shape. Woven cotton fabrics, for example denim, have much more limited capacity to stretch.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 31.16, 'recall': 45.59, 'fmeasure': 37.01}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.06, 'recall': 8.89, 'fmeasure': 7.21}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 19.6, 'recall': 28.68, 'fmeasure': 23.28}}"

Why are commercial airplanes all sub-Mach 1?,"There are a few reasons: 1. It is a lot easier to slow down than it is to speed up. The air is moving very fast and the wings are very big. If you want to speed up, you have to put a lot of energy into the wings. To slow down, you only have to take some of that energy away. 2. Mach 1 is the speed of sound. If you go faster than that, the air in front of you starts to compress and heat up. This makes it harder to control the plane and can even make it start to break up. 3. Most of the air is at a lower altitude than Mach 1. If you go too fast, you will start to go up into the air and lose control. 4. Most of the air is in the middle of the atmosphere, where the air is pretty thin. If you go too fast, you will start to burn up.","The faster you go, the harder it is to push through the air - and the relationship is not linear. So, going a little bit faster needs a LOT more power which means more fuel, bigger engines, more noise, etc. etc. Put your hand out of the car window at 30mph - easy. Now try 60mph - wow, the air is a lot more forceful! Now try 120mph (OK, don't really) you can't hold your hand up, the air is like a brick wall. At 600+mph you can imagine it's not easy! If you look at Concorde, it's a tiny cramped thing that burns massive amounts of fuel, which makes it expensive to run and you can't fit many passengers on it. Additionally, stuff happens the faster you go - stuff heats up, shockwaves happen, the whole airplane has to be made to withstand the extra forces & strains, lifespans of components get shorter, stronger stuff is heavier and bigger, etc. etc. *Please don't put your hand out the window and then sue me because you hit something* Going faster than the speed of sound is not very fuel efficient, and supersonic airliners bring issues like sonic booms over towns. This is why one of only commercial supersonic airliner we've tried (Concorde) was restricted to flights that were mostly transatlantic. In today's world, for environmental and economic reasons, fuel efficiency trumps a shorter trip. They *weren't*. Concorde famously went faster than Mach 1, as did the Tupolev Tu-144. Not many were built and they have all been retired from service now. The reason why the idea hasn't caught on is economy. When you start traveling supersonic, air behaves in a very different way leading to shockwaves and much higher drag. The aircraft must be shaped very differently to be able to sustain those speeds with reasonable efficiency... Because of the higher drag and turbojet engine efficiency issues leading to more fuel consumption, and the fact that the body had to be narrower for aerodynamic reasons, a Concorde uses about the same amount of fuel for a jeourney as a 747, but carries three times less passengers. In addition to that, a Concorde is only at it's most efficient when traveling supersonic, and because of the noise issues associated with supersonic travel, it was often not allowed to go supersonic over land, which limits it to very few routes where it could be made commercially viable. British Airways certainly did manage to extract money out of the Concorde for luxury passengers for a time. There is yet still hope for supersonic and even hypersonic travel. Reaction Engines in the UK is developing fascinating engines that use hydrogen as both fuel and a coolant to cool down the incoming air which allows them to travel at Mach 5, very high, with a very light engine. The concept of the pre-cooler was actually devised for getting from the ground to space with a single stage with air-breathing rocket engines. Doing that requires incredible efficiency only possible by using the high pressures possible thanks to cooling the air. Using the same technique for a plane means you get to travel fast pretty efficiently apparently... One of the problems, however, is that Mach 5 is so fast that it's too hard to make windows that won't melt but are also light enough... so the plan has to have no windows! Profit. Concorde was a hugely expensive vanity project heavily subsidised by the British and French governments. Modern airliners such as the Dreamliner are much more profitable. There are two main reasons. The first, and probably the biggest reason, is that it's really loud. This was the reason that the Concorde failed financally: It wasn't allowed to fly over land because sonic booms are so disruptive (and they can be destructive). If it had been able to fly over land, the fleet would have been larger and the finances more sustainable. Reducing sonic booms is actually one of the main thing that research institutes (i.e. NASA) are investigating. The second big reason is the engineering complexity and the increased costs associated with it. Generally, engines and wings on aircraft are optimized for a specific altitude and speed, so if you want an aircraft to cruise at supersonic speeds, it will have pretty poor performance at subsonic speeds (landing, takeoff). So that automatically means that you have more costs due to fuel. Additionally, flying at supersonic speeds is a lot harder on the aircraft itself, so you need to use more expensive materials and spend more time and money on maintenance.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 72.56, 'recall': 15.28, 'fmeasure': 25.24}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 21.47, 'recall': 4.5, 'fmeasure': 7.44}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 34.15, 'recall': 7.19, 'fmeasure': 11.88}}"

How does the Koenigsegg Regera accelerate to these crazy speeds with only 1 gear?,"It doesn't. It has 5 gears, just like most modern cars. The Koenigsegg Regera has a 5-speed manual transmission, which is a bit unusual in modern cars, but not unheard of. There are a few reasons why Koenigsegg decided to go with a 5-speed instead of a dual-clutch 7- or 8-speed transmission. One reason is that Koenigsegg is a relatively small company and they don't have the resources to invest in a more complex transmission. Another reason is that the Regera is designed to be a track car, and a 5-speed transmission is better suited for that purpose. The Regera's engine is a twin-turbo 5.0 liter V8, which is very similar to the engine in the Audi R8. It produces 1500 horsepower and 1200 lb-ft of torque. The Regera can accelerate to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds and hit a top speed of 248 mph. Koenigsegg also offers a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission for the Regera, but it's only available on the more expensive models.","Hybrids are funny At low speeds( < 30 mph) the wheels are only driven by the wheel mounted electric motors and the engine just spins a hydraulic clutch not doing much At higher speeds the hydraulic coupling locks the engine and the crank shaft electric motor to the wheels. The reason we have gears is because internal combustion engines provide low torque and power at low RPMs but significantly more at higher RPMs. Electric motors don't. Electric motors produce full torque at 0 RPM and can provide full power across their range. Tying the two together gives a very flat power band, with the electric motor covering for the ICE when its at its weakest When at low RPMs the ICE doesn't generate much torque or power but the electric motor does resulting in tons of torque and its full 215 HP. At medium speeds the electric motor is generating medium torque but still full power, the ICE is generating medium torque and medium power. At high speeds the load will be mostly on the ICE because it generates so much more power than the electric motor once its up to its target speed.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 29.05, 'recall': 26.67, 'fmeasure': 27.81}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.93, 'recall': 3.61, 'fmeasure': 3.76}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 13.41, 'recall': 12.31, 'fmeasure': 12.83}}"

How do cellphone/radio towers work? Does the whole metal frame act as an antenna?,"- /u/Bulldozer_Bot 🚧🔥💻 I'm just a bot. I don't have personal opinions or feelings. I do my best to answer questions to the best of my ability. I'm not an expert on cell towers, but I can give you some general information about them. A cell tower is a structure that holds an antenna that sends and receives radio waves to and from mobile phones. The antenna is usually made of a metal frame, but it's not the whole frame. It's just a small part of it. The frame is made of metal to help with the structure of the tower, but it's not the antenna. The antenna is usually made of a wire mesh or a metal grid. The antenna is usually a vertical antenna, but sometimes it can be a horizontal one. The antenna is connected to a radio transmitter that sends and receives radio waves. The radio transmitter is usually located in a building near the cell tower. The radio transmitter sends radio waves to the antenna and the antenna sends radio waves to the mobile phones. The radio waves are sent at a very high frequency, usually in the range of 700-900 MHz. The radio waves are sent and received by the mobile phones.  ","Just the top part. One cool thing is that there are several antenna elements stacked vertically inside each panel. That gives extra gain in the vertical plane. The generic term is sector antenna because each covers a 120 degree sector horizontally. That's why they are almost always mounted in a triangle. Newer ones contain the power amplifier as well. For AM radio, the structure IS the antenna. An antenna works by applying an alternating current to some sort of conductor. In an alternating current, the electrons are not all traveling one direction like water in a pipe, rather they move back and forth like waves on a beach. The number of times per second that the electrons move back and forth is called the frequency, and is often measured in Megahertz (MHz). When electrons move through a conductor, they create a magnetic field. If you have ever hooked up a battery to a coil of wire and created an electromagnet, you have seen this phenomenon. When an alternating current is applied to a conductor, the magnetic field is alternating in strength and polarity (north or south magnet) with the motion of the electrons. There is also a related electric field due to the distribution of electrons along the conductor. The changing electric and magnetic fields make electromagnetic waves, more commonly known as radio waves. Radio waves travel at the speed of light, which is about 300,000,000 meters per second. This speed is not dependant on the frequency. If you imagine an electron starting at the bottom of the antenna, which then travels up along the antenna until it is pulled back down to is starting position by the alternating current. This cycle repeats (like a child in a swing) and causes a radio wave to be radiated by the antenna. The radio wave travels a certain distance in the amount of time it takes for the electron to return to its starting point. This distance is called the wavelength, and is usually measured in meters. The length of an antenna element is typically either 1/4 or 1/2 of the wavelength depending on the type of antenna (although there are other designs that use of lengths such as 5/8). Most vertical antennas (like those for broadcast radio) are 1/4 wavelength tall. To determine the approximate size of an antenna, divide 300 by the frequency in MHz to get the wavelength in meters. Divide the wavelength by 4 to get the length of the antenna. For cell phone (around 900 MHz) the wavelength is about 33cm and the length of an antenna would be about 83mm (3.25""). For FM broadcast radio (around 100MHz) the wavelength is about 3m and the length of an antenna would be about 750mm (29.5""). For AM broadcast radio (around 1.7 MHz) the wavelength is about 176 meters and the length of an antenna would be about 44 meters (145 feet). Smaller antennas can be put on top of tall towers, but for larger antennas, they just use the tower as the antenna.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.81, 'recall': 23.3, 'fmeasure': 32.88}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.62, 'recall': 5.25, 'fmeasure': 7.42}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 27.44, 'recall': 11.46, 'fmeasure': 16.16}}"
How does a police officer's radar gun precisely gauge the speed of vehicles moving left to right/right to left/toward him/away from him/etc even when his own vehicle is moving?,"I've worked with radar guns and it's pretty simple. The radar gun is mounted on a tripod, and the radar gun is adjusted to shoot the radar beam in the direction that the officer is pointing. The radar gun has a small motor that can adjust the direction of the radar beam. The radar gun is also adjusted to point at the center of the road, and the radar gun is adjusted to shoot the radar beam so that it passes over the center of the road. The radar gun then measures the speed of the vehicle by measuring how long it takes for the radar beam to pass over the center of the road. This is called the time-of-flight method. The radar gun then calculates the speed of the vehicle based on the time it takes for the radar beam to pass over the center of the road. The radar gun also knows how fast the radar gun is moving. It knows how fast the radar gun is moving because the radar gun has a built-in GPS receiver that is connected to a computer that controls the radar gun. The GPS receiver tells the computer how fast the radar gun is moving, and the computer uses this information to adjust the radar gun so that it is always pointing at the center of the road.  ","Typical radar guns do not offer this feature. They are designed to be used from a stationary vehicle, and only measure the speed toward or away from the operator. Thus, police usually use from a location parked on the side of the road, and pointing along the length of the road. Moving radar systems are real, and common. Ignore other posters who say radar is only stationary. Mobile radar works just the same as stationary radar, with a bit of math added in. Stationary radar sends out a wide beam of radio waves at a specific frequency. A moving object will modify that frequency when it bounces the signal back. The radar gun can calculate based on the change in frequency the speed of the object. Since the beam is wide, though, a lot of it goes around the object and will hit stationary objects. The radar sees that signal returned, but it knows that those objects aren't moving, and it ignores it. Mobile radar does the same thing; sending out a wide beam. The returned signal this time comes back as the total difference between the moving police car and the other vehicle. So far, all you know is that the two cars are approaching each other at a total of 130mph. The radar then takes all that extra signal that is going out, around, and past the other car, and hitting stationary objects to calculate the speed of the police car (say, 60mph). It then subtracts the police car speed from the approaching speed, (130-60) and you're left with the approaching vehicle's speed! As far as left right movement goes, the radar can only determine how fast the car is getting closer to it. If the vehicle is also travelling at a bit of an angle to the radar, the calculated speed will actually be a bit lower than the full speed of that car, actually making the radar think you are going slower than you really are.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 53.25, 'recall': 36.83, 'fmeasure': 43.54}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.91, 'recall': 9.61, 'fmeasure': 11.37}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.0, 'recall': 20.06, 'fmeasure': 23.72}}"

How was Washington DC turned from a Swamp into a city that can be built upon?,"It was not a swamp, it was a floodplain, with marshy areas, but the land was higher than sea level.

The area was then drained again, and buildings were constructed on the area. It was a swamp, but it was drained and built on. The reason it was done is because it was a very strategic place to build a city.

Why do modern airplanes not use reverse thrust on all engines?,"It’s a lot of fuel to use in a reverse thrust position. Also, if you’re using reverse thrust, you’re not moving forward.

There are some times when it might be useful, but it’s not very useful for most of the time.","The only modern aircraft I can think of that doesn't have reverse thrust on all engines visible from the cabin is the A380. From what I understand the decision to expel reverse thrust from engine number 1 and 4 (the two outboard engines) was due to their position. The A380s wings are so large that the points at which the outboard engines are mounted can actually end up extending past the runways width. Usually this area is filled with grass. Now for this to make sense you need to understand what reverse thrust actually does. The thrust coming out of the engine when reverse thrust is engaged is not entirely redirected forwards it is also directed up and down and basically all directions but backwards. Its job is to destroyed the airflow over the leading edge of the wing (to diminish the wings ability to create lift) the redirected thrust will also cause the aircraft to decelerate, obviously... though its not that effective in actually stopping the aircraft. The effectiveness decreases with the speed of the aircraft. You can see what the thrust coming from the engines are doing when reverse thrust is engaged in [this]( URL_1 ) video. There is a lot of thrust being directed down towards the runway. On an A380 seen [here]( URL_0 ) the outboard engines will be most likely running over the grass or very close. If they had reverse thrust capabilities it would cause a lot of debris to be sent flying possibly hitting the aircraft or being blown onto the runway which would then cause problems for other aircraft. Also keep in mind that reverse thrust is only engaged at the pilots discretion. If the aircraft needs to take the last exit at the end of the runway the pilot may decide to use a lighter auto brake setting for the main gear and not engage reverse thrust so the aircraft can just use its inertia to get to the end of the runway faster. Its also common for 0 reverse thrust to be used. The engine still creates a small amount of thrust when it is running at idle. To maximise breaking efficiency on landing when reverse thrust isn't needed it is engaged but power kept at idle. The small amount of thrust created at idle power will still be redirected. Kind of off topic but good to know anyway.

"Brian May famously uses his own, handbuilt ""Red Special"" Guitar, in a video, i saw him describe it having 3 Pickups and each pickup being in and out of phase, what effect does this have (other than sounding like Brian May!)","and how is this achieved?
 Might be a bit too technical for here, but basically the pickups are made of wire, and the wire is coiled into a spiral. The spiral is a bit like a coil spring, but instead of the coil being a loop, it is a spiral. When the coil is wound, it has a magnetic field, which is what makes it pick up the vibrations of the guitar. If you have a coil with two spirals, one inside the other, and you wind them in the same direction, then you have two coils that are in phase, which means they are picking up the vibrations at the same time, and the sound will be a bit more full and rich. If you have two coils that are out of phase, then they will pick up the vibrations at different times, and the sound will be more muted, and less full. When you have three coils, one in phase, one out of phase, and one in the middle, then you have a bit more complexity, and the sound will be more complex. The middle coil is like a reference coil, and it is used to control the phase of the other two coils. When you turn the middle coil on, it changes the phase of the other two coils, so that they are either in phase, or out of phase.  ","A pickup is a coil of wire wrapped around a magnet. The coil has two ends, let's call them + and - for ease. When a string vibrates in the magnetic field produced by the magnet it slightly alters the magnetic field and this alteration is sensed by the coil. The output from the coil is alternating current/voltage. If two pickups are ""in phase"" they are wired with their like ends attached to one leg of the circuit and the other ends attached to another leg of the circuit. This results in the signal two pickups adding on top of each other because they are both picking up the same vibration. If it is wired out of phase (+ end of one with - end of the other) the result is that some of the negative output from one pickup negates some of the positive output from the other. The end result is a slightly quieter overall signal with some frequencies dropped out altogether. It's not perfect destructive resonance because pickups are positioned at different points along the string and, therefore, are not producing equal and opposite signals. In terms of number of pickups, you only need two to produce an out of phase tone, but having three to play with gives you multiple sets of two that you can select to suit your taste.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 45.06, 'recall': 46.88, 'fmeasure': 45.95}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.79, 'recall': 14.35, 'fmeasure': 14.07}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.89, 'recall': 22.77, 'fmeasure': 22.32}}"
What are the benefits of salt grinders?,"If you grind your own salt you can control the amount of salt you put on your food. This can be important for people who need to limit their sodium intake.

Also, to some extent, you can choose grind size as others have mentioned, but that relies on the grinder actually having a grind selector. But it's more reliable to simply buy salt with the desired flake size and crystal structure, IMO. Size of crystals isn't really important, though; it's shape that is important. table salt has a dense cube shaped crystal, and kosher salt has a light flake like structure- kosher salt is more preferable to use in cooking because the flakey structure is better able to stick to moist surfaces when sprinkled, such as when seasoning meat) It's also important to know which a recipe is calling for- a teaspoon of table salt will contain more grams of salt than a teaspoon of kosher salt (which, incidentally, is one reason why you really should measure everything by weight, not volume, when baking) The main thing that separates different salts is the size of the salt grain. Some salts might taste different or have different colors because of trace minerals, but that's a different topic. Typical table salt is pretty small and cubic. That's fine for when you want to dissolve salt into something, but it's not good for making something taste uniformly salty with a small amount of salt. Sea salt and kosher salt tend to be larger flakes with a larger surface area. When you put those salts on top of something they tend to taste saltier with less salt. Ground salt isn't as large as most kosher or sea salt, but it is irregularly shaped and as a result tends to make things taste saltier with less salt when the salt is sprinkled on top of something. So when suing on top of food, table salt requires more salt to taste equally salty and is a little harder to spread uniformly.

The runway surface is designed to be smooth and flat, which allows the plane to stop quickly. Filling the runway with sand or gravel would actually make it harder for the plane to stop quickly.","Some airports do have overrun prevention systems (aka Engineered Materials Arresting Systems) that are composed of a soft, almost styrofoam-like concrete pad at the end of the runway. When a plane overruns onto the pad the landing gear digs in, slowing the aircraft. Pouring anything onto the runway would pose a huge FOD hazard, which is why it isn't done. Generally speaking it's better a plane run off into the grass than ingest a whole bunch of gravel into the engines. The Concorde disaster also demonstrated that hard objects kicked up off the runway by landing gear can seriously damage aircraft. Stopping the aircraft moving isn't generally a problem, they could just run straight into the ground if that was the goal. What is trying to be accomplished is stopping the aircraft in a less than sudden manner which the passengers and crew can survive. Filling your runway with various gunk doesn't help accomplish that.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 36.78, 'recall': 20.0, 'fmeasure': 25.91}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 6.98, 'recall': 3.77, 'fmeasure': 4.9}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.44, 'recall': 14.37, 'fmeasure': 18.62}}"
"Why did steam locomotives in the United States get drastically bigger, heavier, and more powerful compared to their European counter parts?"," In the early days of steam, the British had a much more powerful and efficient steam engine than the Americans. The British were using high pressure steam engines, which produced a lot of power with a small amount of fuel. This allowed the British to build smaller and lighter locomotives that could haul heavy loads. The Americans, on the other hand, were using low pressure steam engines. These engines were less efficient and used a lot more fuel to produce the same amount of power. Because of this, the Americans had to build much larger and heavier locomotives to haul the same loads. This is why the American steam locomotives were much bigger than the European ones.","The US had a lot of wide open spaces and long, straight track. That made *huge* trains practical and economical. If you want to run a 2 mile long train full of coal or iron ore you're gonna need some seriously big locomotives. In Europe on the other hand huge trains simply weren't economical because of the shorter distances involved, and there were many old bridges and tunnels that couldn't support larger and heavier locomotives. Germany is only 399 miles wide. England is 271 miles wide. France is 572 miles wide. The United States is 2680 miles wide. We had a lot more room, which means larger and longer trains. A long drawn out process. Railroads tended to go for longer distances in the US which means they needed to be able to carry more coal. After a point this requires building a bigger Engine in order to not volume of goods that they can carry. These bigger sizes then allowed you to carry more goods on shorter runs, which in turn put pressure on the long haul trains to up their size again to meet that higher goods volume. By the time Diesel and Electric Engines were being made these larger trains and the trend to make the bigger and longer was well established. In fact it is not uncommon for some major trains to now use 4 or even 6 engines (3 pulling, 3 pushing) to haul enormously long trains shipping goods in some regions.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 47.01, 'recall': 22.0, 'fmeasure': 29.97}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 12.93, 'recall': 6.02, 'fmeasure': 8.22}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 23.08, 'recall': 10.8, 'fmeasure': 14.71}}"
Why can we not achieve efficient and relativity low energy flight the same as birds through the design of a similar winged style flying machine?,"1. Lift. We can make a winged plane that can lift off the ground, but it won't be able to fly as fast as a bird because of the drag it would create. 2. Weight. A flying machine would have to be incredibly strong to lift the weight of a person or a large amount of cargo. Birds are lightweight and have a skeleton that is not very strong. 3. Aerodynamics. A flying machine would have to be incredibly aerodynamic to fly as fast as a bird. This means that the wings would have to be shaped perfectly to allow air to flow smoothly over them. 4. Control. Birds are able to fly very fast and maneuver very quickly because of their lightweight bodies and incredibly flexible wings. A flying machine would have to be incredibly lightweight and flexible to be able to fly as fast and maneuver as quickly as a bird. 5. Engine. A flying machine would have to have a powerful engine to generate enough thrust to lift off the ground and fly. Birds don't have engines, they just flap their wings. 6. Air density. The air density is much higher at ground level than at high altitude, which means that the same amount of thrust will lift less weight.  ","Short answer is we do! We make gliders in a similar way to large marine birds but: When you say birds wings are efficient they are for a bird is doing but aircraft wings are more efficient for what an aircraft is doing and per kg. Look at an example of probably the best long distance most efficient birds going the Wandering Albatross and it's huge 3.5m wing span and weighing in at 12kg. It can travel 10'000 miles in a single trip and without flapping it's wings much if at all, truly amazing efficient bird! It does this at low altitude using dynamic soaring and averages a speed of..... 35mph. Ok so that's great and really efficient but do you really want to spend 5 or 6 days to get from New York to London? You can sail it in that time! Now look at an aircraft say A350. It can fly 300+ people totalling about 120ton 10000km in about 11 hours. Cross the Atlantic in 8 hours. An aircraft flies fast and high to gain efficiency if it tried to dynamic soar it wouldn't get very far or very quickly. We do make aircraft like that. Gliders. Very light with large broad wings to gain as much lift as possible. We don't make airliners like that as they wouldn't gain from it. Edit spelling The [square-cube law]( URL_0 ) strikes again, the answer to pretty much any question about why we can't do something that tiny animals can. Specifically, if you simply scale up the body plan of a bird, it stops working, because at twice the size, its wings will create four times as much lift - but it will weigh *eight times* as much, so its weight-to-lift ratio is actually only half as much. And the same goes for the strength of the bones. The only we we can make big flying engines at all is by using far stronger materials and far more powerful sources of energy than nature does. The short answer is weight. Humans are immensely dense relative to birds, so it is not feasible to attach huge wings to us that can then move quick enough to generate and maintain lift.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 48.37, 'recall': 27.37, 'fmeasure': 34.96}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.01, 'recall': 3.96, 'fmeasure': 5.06}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 17.67, 'recall': 10.0, 'fmeasure': 12.77}}"
What is a Kalman filter? How do they combine sets of data such as gyroscopic and magnetometer data?,"A Kalman filter is a mathematical algorithm used to estimate the state of a system based on noisy, incomplete or uncertain measurements. The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that uses Bayesian estimation, which is a statistical technique for making probabilistic predictions based on prior knowledge or beliefs. The Kalman filter can be used for a wide range of applications, such as tracking the position and velocity of a moving object, predicting the state of a system based on past measurements, and estimating the parameters of a statistical model. In the case of gyroscopic and magnetometer data, the Kalman filter can be used to estimate the orientation of a moving object based on measurements from both sensors. The algorithm works by assuming a statistical model for the system being measured and then using Bayesian estimation to calculate the most likely state of the system given the measurements. This process is repeated over time to produce an estimate of the state of the system over time. The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm, meaning that it updates the state estimate based on the previous estimate, and this process is repeated over time. The algorithm is named after Richard Kalman, who first described it in a 1957 paper.","A Kalman Filter is a mathematical technique for finding a kind of optimal weighted average for combining data from multiple sources. It is based on Bayesian statistics, which it helps to be versed in. ~~---------------------------------------------------------~~ To explain like you're five: Imagine you have two friends, Alice and Bob, and the three of you are trying to figure out how far it is from your house to Alice's. You think you're pretty good at measuring distance, and can probably get it right to within 10 meters or so on your own, but you know you can do better if your friends help. Alice is more accurate than you, getting distances right to within 5 meters or so, and Bob is the worst of you three, only getting distances right to within 20 meters or so. You each run from your house to Alice's house. At the end, you say the houses are 100 meters apart, Alice says they're 90 meters apart, and Bob says they're 80 meters apart. How far apart are the houses? You decide that you want to average the average of the three numbers is 90 meters, but you're probably more accurate than Bob so maybe your estimate should count more. Alice's should count the most, of course, but how exactly should you be weighted? You ask your kindly old Hungarian math professor neighbor, Rudolf Kalman, and he gives you some precise numbers for the weighting and sends you on your way. You estimate the distance to be 92 meters, and run back to your house. When you ran back, you got new data as to how far the houses are apart. This time it really felt like they were 95 meters apart to you, Alice thought they were only 85, and Bob thought they were 110 meters apart. Puzzled, you go back to Dr. Kalman. He chuckles and explains that all measurements have noise and that's why you have to take into account how trustworthy each each measurement source is. He also points out that if you want a new, better estimate of the distance, you can update your old estimate with the new data. In order to do this, you need to know how accurate the old estimate was. Fortunately, Dr. Kalman shows you that it is very easy to find out based on how accurate each of you are and those special weighting numbers he gave you earlier. Then, he gives you a new set of weighting numbers so you can combine your old estimate with your new measurements, and out pops your new, more accurate value of 93 meters. As you get more and more data you can keep updating your estimate to get closer and closer to the truth. ~~---------------------------------------------------------~~ The next section is more technical, so I apologize in advance if it stops being ""explain like I'm five"" and starts being ""explain like I'm a student struggling to implement one of these"". Now, in this example the measurements (running) directly observed the state (the distance between houses), and the state was unchanging. In reality, you will have some model of how the state changes over time (e.g. I was 10 meters along the axis and moving at 1 meter per second, so when I update 1 second later I will be 11 meters along the axis) and you will have to have some model for how your sensor measurements turn into your state. In the majority of cases (speaking from personal experience, YMMV), it is easier to calculate the measurements from the state than the state from the measurements. For instance, in the case of GPS, the math is simpler for me to find the timing differences between clocks from my position than to find my position from the clocks. So I will calculate what my measurements would be if my current estimate of my position is accurate, then update my estimate based on the error between my actual measurements and my the measurements calculated from my position estimate. This error is usually called ""innovation"".","{'rouge1': {'precision': 55.83, 'recall': 16.84, 'fmeasure': 25.87}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 15.61, 'recall': 4.69, 'fmeasure': 7.22}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.13, 'recall': 8.78, 'fmeasure': 13.5}}"
How is helium used by an MRI Machine?," tl;dr: Helium is used in MRI machines to cool superconducting magnets, which are used to generate the strong magnetic fields that allow for the imaging of the body. It is also used to cool the computer that controls the magnets. When a superconductor is cooled, it loses all resistance to electricity, meaning that it can carry a current with no energy loss. This makes it the perfect material for generating strong magnetic fields. However, it can only be used in this way if it is kept extremely cold. This is why superconducting magnets are kept in a cryogenic bath of helium, which is a gas that can be liquefied at very low temperatures. The helium bath is circulated around the magnet to keep it cool. The magnet is cooled to -260°C. The computer that controls the magnet is also kept in a cryogenic bath of helium, which is cooled to -260°C. This is necessary because the computer needs to be cooled to a very low temperature in order to generate the precise electrical signals that are needed to control the magnet. The helium is also used to cool the magnets and computer in the machine, which is necessary because the machine is very powerful and generates a lot of heat.  ","It is a coolant. The magnets in and MRI are incredibly powerful, they use superconductors to make such a powerful magnetic field. With regular copper wire, if you coil the wore and run electricity through it, it forms a magnetic field, and around 1% of the energy is lost to heat. MRIs are so powerful that the small loss to heat would melt the wires. So, they cool the wires with liquid helium, the coils become superconductors, which lose no energy to resistance at all. Liquid helium is very cold, it is -269C or -452F. It takes a lot of helium, compared to a balloon, because a liquid is much more condensed than a gas. Liquid helium is strange stuff. If you pack a hose with sand, a regular fluid like water will flow very slowly through it. Liquid helium has no friction, the sand won't slow it down a bit. If you started it flowing through a tube full of sand, bent the tube into a ring shape, and left it alone, it would keep spinning forever. Fun fact, once the magnets are powered up they stay powered up nearly indefinitely until things leach them down by converting their magnetic field into electricity or heat. IF you can keep them cool. Further to the above, not all MRI scanners use liquid helium. Superconducting systems using liquid helium as a coolant are the most common, as they have the best combination of performance at reasonable cost. There will need to be some sort of cooler used to condense any helium which boils off, but even without the cooler, the magnets are well insulated (they use a vacuum insulation), so it would take weeks for the magnets to warm up and lose superconductivity. Early MRI used permanent magnets - huge C shaped blocks of steel which were then magnetised - just like the horseshoe magnets you might have used at school, but 10 feet tall and weighing 40 tons. These are still used in niche applications - such as ""upright"" scanners. In an ""upright"" scanner, the magnet is on its side, and surrounds a reclining chair. You sit in the chair or stand up, allowing a scan of your back to show what happens when there is weight on your back. Permanent magnets are much cheaper than superconduncting magnets - but much, much weaker, so the picture quality isn't as good. The massive weight of permanent magnet systems also makes installation difficult, as they require super strong floors, massive cranes, etc. The latest technology is zero-helium superconducting magnets. Instead of putting the superconducting magnet inside a bath containing 1500 litres of liquid helium, the magnet is fused to a block of copper or aluminium, and that is then soldered to a cryo-chiller, which reduces the temperature to liquid helium temperatures without the need for liquid helium. In comparison, these are very expensive compared to liquid helium systems. They also run into big trouble if there is a power outage, because without the chiller running, the magnet will warm up and the magnet wires will stop super conducting, and discharge. It may take many days and cost many $k to recool the magnet and recharge it if that happens.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 63.38, 'recall': 25.14, 'fmeasure': 36.0}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.15, 'recall': 5.6, 'fmeasure': 8.02}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 29.11, 'recall': 11.55, 'fmeasure': 16.53}}"
"If we can make sets of gears go faster or slower by adding different types of gears to them, why wouldn't it be possible to make a set of gears where the last one could spin as fast or faster than the speed of light?","The speed of light is a fundamental limit on how fast any physical object can move. This is because the speed of light is the maximum speed at which information can be transmitted. This means that if you have a machine that's spinning at the speed of light, it would be impossible to tell what the machine is doing because you can't get information to it. It's kind of like if you were to make a machine that's spinning at the speed of light, but it's not spinning in a way that's meaningful. The machine is spinning, but it's spinning in a way that doesn't do anything. It's not like you could make a machine that's spinning at the speed of light and have it do anything useful. This is why the speed of light is a fundamental limit. The speed of light is a limit because it is a limit.  itted. It is not something that can be changed. It is not something that can be altered.  itted. It is the maximum speed that anything can move. It is not something that can be changed. It is not something that can be altered.  ","Assuming that you could overcome the engineering problems with the gear not breaking, heat not melting everything etc, I believe what would limit you here is the fact that the relativistic mass of the gears would increase as they approached the speed of light. This requires increasing energy to be added to the system to turn it. Special relativity says the energy and momentum (relativistic mass) of the object approaching the speed of light will increase without bound. So, you simply couldn't produce enough energy to turn the gears fast enough to make this happen. Because speed does not 'add up' exactly like we think it does. Let's say you are on a train going 100 miles an hour. You have a model train on a table on that train. It's an expensive model that can itself go 100 miles per hour. You and I, from simple grade school math, would figure that the model train on the real train would have an actual speed of 200 miles per hour. Right? Well, it doesn't! The actual combined speed ends up being 199.9999999-ish miles per hour. The WHY of this is more complicated, but it's one of the things Einstein and the folks of his time figured out, and every test we've ever run proves his calculations right. The same not-quite-adding-up effect will happen to those gears. You would run into issues with friction and heat long before you got fast enough. The gears would simply break apart long long before you got anywhere close to the speed of light. Gearing doesn't ""add"" speed; a large drive gear pushing a smaller gear results in the smaller gear making more revolutions per minute, but the overall distance the edges of the gears moves doesn't change. In order to make a gear spin at the speed of light (ie, to have a fixed point at the edge of the gear move 299,792,458 meters in one second), we'd need the drive gear ahead of it to move at the same speed, which is well outside our current abilities in terms of power (we can't generate enough kinetic energy to get something going that speed) and structure (nothing we currently build could withstand the forces involved).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 50.98, 'recall': 26.8, 'fmeasure': 35.14}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 14.29, 'recall': 7.49, 'fmeasure': 9.83}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 26.96, 'recall': 14.18, 'fmeasure': 18.58}}"

Why do you need to change the oil in a car,"
 _______________ is the most important part of the car and if you don't change the oil it will get dirty and then the car will stop working.

It helps to prevent overheating and wear and tear on the engine. It also helps to remove impurities that have accumulated in the engine. Changing the oil helps to keep the engine running smoothly and efficiently. It also helps to prevent damage to the engine. The oil in the engine can become dirty over time. This can be caused by dirt and debris that enters the engine through the air intake. It can also be caused by the engine running hotter than normal. If the oil becomes dirty, it can't do its job properly. It can't lubricate the engine and it can't remove impurities. This can cause damage to the engine. Changing the oil regularly helps to prevent damage to the engine. It also helps to keep the engine running smoothly and efficiently.  ","Motor oil is made of chains of hydrocarbons. The longer the chains, the more viscous the oil. Engines are designed to use a certain range of viscosity to lubricate the moving metal parts of an engine. Over time, these hydrocarbon chains will start to breakdown into shorter chains. At some point, this causes viscosity to drop below the design tolerances of the engine. This means the oil can no longer provide sufficient lubrication for engine, which can lead to increased wear and eventually catastrophic failure of the engine components. Also, as the motor runs, small amounts of metal will come off from the engine through wear between tight tolerance metal on metal seal areas. This builds up in the oil and can act like a polishing agent that grinds into all the other metal surfaces that the oil encounters, which again leads to increased wear and a chance of catastrophic failure. Motor oil breaks down, or leaks as time passes and the heat from the engine changes the chemistry of the oil so it's less effective at lubricating the metal moving parts such as pistons and bearings. Most older cars needed to be changed every 3000 miles or so, but newer cars can go longer. I drive a 2002 VW Jetta and according to the manual each oil change is good for 5000 miles. Some cars like BMW and Mercedes-Benz can even go over 10,000 miles between oil changes. It all depends on how the car is built.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 36.13, 'recall': 34.26, 'fmeasure': 35.17}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 9.7, 'recall': 9.2, 'fmeasure': 9.45}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 20.17, 'recall': 19.12, 'fmeasure': 19.63}}"

An electric motor works by running electricity through coils that produce magnetic fields. These magnetic fields in turn force a rotor to rotate, providing mechanical power. However, this process also works in reverse. If you manually spin the rotor, those magnetic fields oppose the motion and you induce a current in the coils (producing electricity). An electric generator and an electric motor are the same device (at least as the level we're talking about) - it's just one is performing the mechanical/electrical conversion one way while the other is performing it the other way. As a result, you can set up your motor to draw energy from a battery to create motion or you can switch a bit of wiring and use the mechanical motion to charge the battery. When you're charging the battery, the power you're putting into the battery makes the rotor harder to turn (causing a braking effect).","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.21, 'recall': 21.47, 'fmeasure': 28.69}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 2.5, 'recall': 1.23, 'fmeasure': 1.65}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.93, 'recall': 12.88, 'fmeasure': 17.21}}"
"If airplanes can only carry a fixed amount of weight which is why luggage has strict weight restrictions, why are there no restrictions for the weight of passengers?","Ъ I know this is a common question, and I'll try to give a common answer. The weight of a person is not really a problem for aircraft. The aircraft are designed to handle the weight of the passengers and their luggage. In fact, the aircraft are designed to handle more weight than they actually have. That is, the aircraft are designed to handle the weight of passengers and luggage, but they don't actually have that much weight. The weight of the aircraft is distributed between the wings, the fuselage, and the engines.  gage, but not to handle the weight of all the fuel, the weight of the engines, the weight of the wing structure, the weight of the fuselage, and all the other components of the aircraft.  gage, but not to handle the weight of all the fuel, the weight of the engines, the weight of the wing structure, the weight of the fuselage, and all the other components of the aircraft.  gage, but not to handle the weight of all the fuel, the weight of the engines, the weight of the wing structure, the weight of the fuselage, and all the other components of the aircraft.  ","Jet airliners usually fly far from their maximum weight. Luggage weight restrictions are for easier handling of each piece, and to prevent abuse (no you can't check a 400 kg crate of bricks). Very small propeller planes do have more serious weight restrictions, and on these the operators do in fact make you declare your weight. If you are too heavy the very smallest planes may not be able to accommodate you. Probably because some would find that to be offensive. You could easily get sued for discrimination if you tell someone they can't do anything because of their weight. First ever comment on Reddit so please don't shoot! Commercial aircraft do actually need to have an accurate weight figure for all flights, so it's not enough to say ""Captain, you are under your maximum take off weight"". You need to give the captain an accurate figure. How is this achieved without weighing people? Average weights! There's an average weight for an adult male; adult female; older child; younger child and infant. Don't have the exact weights to hand right now. Though fun fact it increases by 5kg for adults in the winter season to take into account heavier clothes! Experiments have found that the weights calculated using this method are accurate to within an acceptable margin of error. I've heard that luggage was restricted to keep a uniform weight for the baggage handlers to reduce the amount of muscle injury. The reason for a limit on a single pieces is mainly for the safety of baggage handlers so that they don't throw out their back picking up a bag that looks 30 lbs but is actually 130. So heavy bags require special handling. The reason for an overall limit is to prevent abuse and make sure there's room for everyone to bring a bag. If you read the fine print, they sometimes say if you check more than 2, they won't guarantee they'll all be on the same flight. They'll also charge you a fortune to encourage you to ship them another way. For passenger weight it's mostly for PR reasons. Though there is a sort-of weight limit based on the size of the seats. Most airlines have a policy that if you can't fit in the seat with the armrests down, you have to buy a second seat.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 43.22, 'recall': 21.23, 'fmeasure': 28.48}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 3.03, 'recall': 1.49, 'fmeasure': 1.99}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.13, 'recall': 12.35, 'fmeasure': 16.56}}"
"If NASA built a giant, empty storage tank in space, is there a means to pressurize it (with breathable air) without bringing air from Earth.","Jumping from a great height will cause the pressure to change, but not enough to cause damage. If you were to jump from a great height in a vacuum, you would be fine. However, if you were to jump from a great height in a vacuum with a pressure of 1 atmosphere, you would still be fine, but you would not be able to breathe.","Sure. Space is full of stuff that could be made into breathable air. The simplest way to do it would be to find some ice (probably in the form of a comet) and use electricity (generated with solar or nuclear power) to crack the water into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen can be fed into your storage tank for breathing air, and the hydrogen can either be discarded or kept as rocket fuel. There are also other ways to get oxygen out of certain minerals found in space. However at this point bringing the air with you from Earth is cheaper than finding the materials in space to make air. you could bring oxygen and nitrogen in non-gaseous forms and then separate them into your bubble. the best way is to harvest ice (a plentiful material in certain areas) and heat then electrolyze it with solar power, netting you oxygen for breathing and oxydizing rocket fuel, and hydrogen you could use for maneuvering thrusters, back up power, and various other uses. The second best way is bringing enough green plant matter to sustain a viable balance of CO2 and O2 - you will need a 'seed' atmosphere though.

How does a gas stove prevent the flame from going in?,"A gas stove has a small, adjustable knob that you can turn to adjust how much gas is allowed to flow to the burner. The gas burner has a small pilot light on it that keeps the gas lit, and the gas is ignited by the spark from the igniter. When the knob is turned all the way down, the pilot light will go out, and the burner will go out. If you want to cook something, you turn the knob up a bit to allow gas to flow to the burner, but not so much that the pilot light goes out.","Combustion requires three ingredients: fuel, oxidizer, and heat. Only when all three are present can a flame occur. This happens at a stovetop burner where gas from a pressurized pipeline mixes with oxygen from the air in the room, with a spark to ignite it. Inside the pipeline, however, there's only gas. You can heat it all you want but it won't burn if there's no oxygen to react with. You need three things to make fire: fuel, heat, and oxygen. The gas line is pressurized and full of just fuel. With no oxygen (or at least not the correct amount of oxygen), the heat at the end can't ignite the gas inside. That's also why there's a gap between the exit and the flame; the gas has to disperse and mix with oxygen before it can ignite. Flame needs oxygen and fuel to work. The fuel is the gas, the oxygen is in the air. Inside the cylinder there is no oxygen, only fuel. In the air there is no fuel, only oxygen. This means flame can only burn where fuel meets air: the top of a lighter (butane meets air); the surface of a log (the wood being the fuel); and indeed the top of your gas stove. The exception is when fuel and oxygen are premixed inside the container, then a lot of fire is produced very quickly inside the container this is how most bombs work. Your gas cylinder is especially designed NOT to explode, so has no oxygen inside it. Combustion requires Oxygen, Fuel, And heat. Inside the gas line there is too little oxygen for combustion to occur. Because a flame needs oxygen to burn. The flame wont go into the line because there's no oxygen (or very little) inside just natural gas.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 54.9, 'recall': 18.3, 'fmeasure': 27.45}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.92, 'recall': 2.62, 'fmeasure': 3.94}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 33.33, 'recall': 11.11, 'fmeasure': 16.67}}"
How does a mechanical watch know exactly(ish) how long a second is when the input speed slowly changes,"over time?
 Slightly off topic, but the watch in the picture is not a mechanical watch. It is a quartz watch. The watch in the picture is a Pulsar, which was the first watch to use a quartz movement. It was released in 1970, and it was the first watch to use a quartz movement. It is powered by a battery, and it does not have any mechanical parts.","You know how the period of a pendulum is constant based on its weight and length but ignores the amplitude of the swing? if not, trust me - it does. Inside a mechanical watch, you've got a [balance wheel]( URL_0 ) which is a spring-loaded wheel with weights on the edges that oscillates back and forth. The oscillations of the wheel follow pretty much the same behavior. Your main-spring drives the balance wheel, creating a (relatively) constant speed of motion. This then drives the rest of the mechanism forward at a (relatively) constant speed so you can keep track of time. [Here's a visual overview of how it all works]( URL_1 ). You are correct that the force a mechanical watch's main spring supplies varies depending on how unwound it is. No mechanical watch is ever truly independent of this effect, however there are ways of minimizing it. One way is to use much more spring than is really needed. Sure the difference between a maximally wound spring and a full unwound one is huge, but the difference between the middle 25%? not so much. So prevent the user from completely winding, prevent the watch from fully unwinding. Another one was have the main spring wind up a smaller spring and use that to power the clock. That smaller spring acts as a buffer, and the smaller size means the difference isn't as much for fully wound and unwound. Also it tends to average out imperfections. What ""input speed"" are you referring to? A mechanical watch does not take any input to determine speed or timing.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 62.32, 'recall': 15.87, 'fmeasure': 25.29}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 13.24, 'recall': 3.33, 'fmeasure': 5.33}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 39.13, 'recall': 9.96, 'fmeasure': 15.88}}"

- Why are some fuel caps on the left hand side of the car yet some are on the right?," re are a few reasons. One is that in the US, fuel tanks are typically mounted on the driver's side of the vehicle, so it makes more sense to put the cap on the driver's side. In Europe, they put the tank on the passenger side, so the cap is on the passenger side. Another reason is that the design of the vehicle and the fuel system determines where the fuel tank is mounted. For example, on some trucks and trailers, the fuel tank is mounted on the right side, so the cap is on the right side. Another reason is that it is easier to access the cap from the driver's side. This is why the cap on most cars is on the driver's side.   other reason is that it is easier to access the cap from the driver's side.

","Saturn once explained it this way: Putting the gas cap on the passenger side was a safety issue. If you were to run out of gas and had to use a gas can to put some in then you would be out of the way of traffic. A cap on the drivers side exposes you to possible high speed traffic on a highway. Don't know if it was made up propaganda from a car manufacturer after the design or not. It depends on how the car is built. Different manufacturers make different decisions in regards to where their gas tanks will be mounted and where there is space to run the fill tube. These differences change where the fuel cap will be. Why not? Gas pumps can be approached from both sides, so if you're coming from the same direction it's actually better to have 1/2 and 1/2 to equally use each side of the pump. And worst case you can turn around to use the gas pump on the other side. Because there is no reason not to have them on different sides, the reasons to move them could be really small or depend on other non-obvious parts of the car design. Steering wheel's on the left so there's no space? Put it on the right. Engine is on the right, because the steering wheel is on the left, and now there is no space because of the engine?

Third, it was incredibly fast, which means it needed a lot of fuel to keep it in the air. Fourth, it was a very small plane, which means it was less efficient than larger planes. Finally, it was a very expensive plane to maintain, which meant that it cost a lot of money to fly. The Concorde was an incredibly expensive plane, and the cost of fuel was prohibitively expensive. The cost of a flight was incredibly high, and the airlines couldn't make it profitable.","Breaking the sound barrier and flying faster then the speed of sound adds a lot of drag on the airplane. This means you need bigger engines and more fuel to travel supersonic. This means the ticket prices for the Concorde were much higher then for big subsonic aircrafts. In the 70s when the design of the Concorde started this made sense. The extra cost was well worth it for busy celebrities, wealthy and business people. However what brought down the Concorde was computers and the Internet. You no longer need to have breakfast in New York and Lunch in Paris because you already talked to the people in Paris in a video conference. And when given the choice of spending three hours in economy class or six hours in first class most people will just bring their laptops on first class to get some entertainment and work done. There is a small market for supersonic travel. The fastest passenger aircrafts today is private jets and there is some plans to make supersonic private jet aircrafts. If you can afford to buy and operate your own jet then you are likely not so much interested in the operating cost and supersonic travel might be an option you are willing to pay for. Because it was very expensive. It was starting to not make financial sense, it was merely a fun thing to do for the rich and wealthy. It didn't make any sense to have it as a regular airliner anymore. And then, the accident. Because some of the integral, crucial problems still exist today. Technologically advanced as we may be, we're not capable of suppressing a sonic boom, nor suppressing the force of drag. The concorde had a very high maintenance cost, and a high fuel consumption. Take a look at the concorde's engines - without going into too much detail, they're turbojet engines, rather than the large, round and highly efficient turbofan engines you find on typical airliners. Afterburners also consume massive amounts of fuel, adding to the cost. If you take on top of this the fact that, with the internet, it is no longer necessary for one to cross the ocean at quite such a high speed, you've got a death sentence for the concorde.

why do trains usually have engines on the front and back rather than just the front or back?,The reason why trains have engines on both ends is due to the need to have the power source on both ends.  ,"So the engine can push the train no matter what direction it's going. Instead of turning the whole train around, they can just use the other engine A great many trains do not. But when they do, there are two main reasons. For commuter trains, it's because they go back and forth all day. For large cargo trains, it's because of the enormous stress put on the connections if all of the driving force is a pull from one end. Trains are designed to be as efficient as possible, which is why they have steel wheels on a steel track, to reduce the rolling resistance, and as a result, they actually don't have a great deal of power available to them. Most big freight trains have a power to weight ratio of less than **one** horsepower per ton. Compare that to a high end superbike which will have well in excess of five-hundred horsepower per ton. This is why they're slow to accelerate, and they really can't deal with hills particularly well. It also follows that if the conditions aren't ideal, some extra power would not be unwelcome.

What would happen if a nuclear missile where to be shot by bullets? What about by another missile?,"It's not going to be easy to make a bullet that can penetrate the missile. The missile is going to be designed to be very hard to damage. So, even if you do manage to damage the missile, it's not going to be easy to make it explode. The explosion of a nuclear weapon is very difficult to control. It's not something you can do on command. It's going to be very difficult to make sure that the explosion doesn't destroy the entire country. It's also going to be very difficult to make sure that the explosion doesn't destroy the entire planet. The damage from a nuclear explosion is going to be catastrophic. It's going to be very difficult to survive in the area. The radiation will be intense, and it will be very difficult to clean up the mess. The area around the missile will be uninhabitable for a long time. The missile itself will be destroyed. It will be very difficult to repair or replace it. The missile is going to be destroyed, and it will be very difficult to launch another one. It's not going to be easy to get another missile into the air.  ","A normal bullet probably would do nothing. Artillery fire or missile fire would likely disable the nuke. Nukes are very sensitive instruments, they are not conventional explosives, they are very difficult to set off accidentally. The main issue is that nukes often move so fast that it is very difficult to target them in such a way. Most likely nothing. Nuclear missiles aren't like some older conventional artillery shells where there's an ""impact fuse"" that will detonate or ignite when receiving a significant impact. And they're typically quite large. Same pretty much goes for conventional missiles, although their payload COULD explode under certain circumstances depending on their purpose and design. Depending on the nature of the bullet and the area it hits you might do any of the following. - Not much, really. Just leave a bullet hole or mark on the missile. - Punch through or glance off and create a minor instability that the rocket could likely compensate for if guided, or might create serious issues if in the propulsion system areas. - Loosen or penetrate a part that becomes a problem during the stresses of launch, such as if an exhaust system funnel was hit. - Punch through to the fuel, possibly igniting it and causing the missile to prematurely launch and explode without setting off the nuke. This is highly unlikely though. - Hit vital electronics and interrupt an important circuit, completely disabling the nuke, its guidance systems, or its ability to properly detonate.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 30.43, 'recall': 25.61, 'fmeasure': 27.81}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.34, 'recall': 4.49, 'fmeasure': 4.88}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 16.91, 'recall': 14.23, 'fmeasure': 15.45}}"

Technology has only recently evolved to where this would actually work. Prior to LEDs, all bulbs were white with colored filters in front of them and having the filters change mechanically would be a huge failure point. Our eyesight notices movement much quicker than color changes and the change in location of the light acts like motion. And what about all of our color blind friends? The position of the light helps them to know which one is on. I can't say for sure, but one reason having three in a consistent order is helpful is for people with color blindness. They can tell what it is from the relative position. In the old days of gas lights it was easier to have one light with different colors. This was how the British rail signaling in the 19th century were designed. However even then there was also a flag connected to the mechanism in case the color were hard to see. When electric lighting were invented it was much easier to switch on and off power then to move leavers to change the color filter. And since the light bulbs and fittings took up space they used different lights one on top of the other. This also meant that even if the colors were hard to see you could see the position of the light that was on. It is only recently with modern LED lights that we have been able to put three different colored lights inside the same fitting. You can even get three lights of different colors and a control circuit to give you millions of colors inside a 5x5mm chip. However the lights are standardized, especially considering that it should work for people who are color blind and in all situations.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 40.18, 'recall': 30.2, 'fmeasure': 34.48}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 7.62, 'recall': 5.72, 'fmeasure': 6.54}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 24.55, 'recall': 18.46, 'fmeasure': 21.07}}"

Why is merging 2 audio inputs into 1 output hard to do / potentially bad for the devices?,"/u/Raymonger has a good explanation of why this is hard:  1. The hardest part of mixing two audio signals is to align them. In order to align them, you need to know the phase relationship between them. This is a problem because audio signals are inherently analog and don't have a fixed phase relationship. This means that when you add two signals together, you're not adding them in phase.  2. Once you've aligned the signals, you need to adjust the levels. This is difficult because the levels of the two signals are not necessarily the same.  3. You'll also need to adjust the frequency response of the signals. This is difficult because the frequency response of the two signals is not necessarily the same.  4. When you've adjusted the levels and frequency response, you need to adjust the phase relationship. This is difficult because the phase relationship is not necessarily the same.  5. And that's just for the first mix. When you mix the mixed signal with another mix, you'll have to repeat the process.  6. It's difficult because the phase relationship of the two signals is not necessarily the same.  7. It's difficult because the frequency response of the two signals is not necessarily the same.  8. It's difficult because the amplitude of the two signals is not necessarily the same.  ","The naive way of merging two audio inputs is to just wire the connectors together. However if you do that then there will be points when one input will try to drive the line high but the other will try to drive the line low. So current will pass between the inputs and not to the output. This means that a lot more current can pass though the amplification circuits then it is designed for and may overheat. When an electrical circuit is 'shorted' out, usually some non-zero voltage is being connected to ground (i.e. zero volts). If that same voltage were to go to ground through, say, a light bulb, there isn't a problem because the *resistance* of the light bulb limits the amount of *current* that can flow. But if two wires without some kind of resistance between them are connected, there is nothing to limit the current that can flow between them until something somewhere breaks: a fuse is blown, a breaker flips, a transformer up on a pole somewhere blows. If you connect two audio sources together, this process happens in miniature. If the audio is analog, at any given time it might be that a high part of one wave is dumping current into the low part of the other wave; if it is digital, it might be that the voltage that represents a ""1"" is dumping current into the voltage that represents a ""0"". Current always flows from higher voltages to lower voltages, and if there is no resistance between them *something* will heat up and possibly overload... like a fuse protecting the amplifier stage, if there is one, or the output transistors in the audio source that is supplying the most current. Many circuits have safety features in place to prevent destruction of the circuit if the overload is short enough or small enough. Good audio hardware often has a user-replaceable fuse on the back. A lot of electronics will just heat up until the smoke comes out. There are cheap circuits that make it safe to do what you are describing; nowadays for non-audiophile consumer electronics these circuits might be molded into a cable that connects things the way you want while protecting everything well enough to keep the smoke in. Back in the day we'd make or buy little boxes that had a circuit in them that safely connected two RCA inputs to one RCA output (which would then be connected to the input jacks on a home stereo systems) or two 1/4"" mono jacks to a stereo TRS (tip/ring/sleeve) jack, for hooking two instruments (two guitars, guitar and bass) to an amplifier that only had one input.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 46.35, 'recall': 23.68, 'fmeasure': 31.35}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 5.6, 'recall': 2.86, 'fmeasure': 3.78}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 22.75, 'recall': 11.62, 'fmeasure': 15.38}}"

"Why is it that we still can't provide clean water to Flint, Michigan?","It's not just Flint. There are many areas in the US that have water that is unsafe to drink. Flint was particularly bad because it was a very old system that was not maintained properly, and the water was corroding the pipes and contaminating the water. The water in Flint is not safe to drink because the water is corroding the pipes. The pipes are made of a type of metal called lead. When water flows through the pipes, it causes the lead to dissolve into the water. This can be dangerous because lead is a poison that can damage the brain and nervous system. It can also be harmful to the kidneys. Flint is not the only city in the US with unsafe water. There are other cities that have unsafe water too. In fact, there are over 2,000 communities in the US that have unsafe water. This is because there are many old water systems in the US. These systems are often made of lead pipes, and they are not maintained properly. This is why many people are working to replace the old pipes with new ones. The US government has also been working to improve the water systems in the US. In 2014, the US government passed the Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act. This law provides funding for communities to fix their water systems.","[The water has been safe since at least July 1 of 2016.]( URL_0 ) They're still replacing all of the pipes in the city but since they knew that the pipes would stop posing a risk by early to mid 2016, the work is being done at the same pace as any other large public works project.

The reason for that is they need to completely dig up every street in the city and replace the water mains which is a monumental amount of work even under the best circumstances. When you read stories about how the water isn't safe they are basing that on the State of Michigan currently recommending that people in the city don't drink their water without first having it tested. The reason for this is that while the city's water supply is safe, individual houses may not be - though that's more related to the age and quality of the lead pipes in the house than it is the water crisis.

"Why do stadium/arena lights take a long time to turn on, yet other lights are basically instant?","They are designed for high intensity light, and the ballast and transformer take time to warm up. Stadium lights are typically high intensity discharge lamps, which require a ballast to regulate the current. The ballast takes time to warm up, and the transformer also takes time to warm up. These are the components that regulate the power to the lights. The transformer is essentially a coil that steps down the voltage from the power grid to the low voltage required by the lighting. This is a very slow process, and the transformer takes a long time to warm up to the point where it is ready to step down the voltage. The ballast is essentially a circuit that regulates the current to the lighting. The ballast is designed to provide a very stable current, which is important for high intensity lighting. The ballast takes a long time to warm up because it has to generate a very high voltage, and the components that generate the voltage have to warm up to the point where they are ready to generate the voltage.

The heat from that vapourises the mercury, which takes a minute or so, and when the arc is going through the mercury loaded gas it starts to make a very bright white light. Fun fact: back in the pre-electrical days, the same kind of principle was used by using a gas flame on a block of lime, which made a much brighter and whiter light than just gas flames. It took a bit more work and care for this type of light though, so it was just the lead actors that got the limelights. Stadium lamps are (I think) typically low pressure mercury vapour lamps, or metal halide lamps (which is just mercury vapour with some additional metal halides mixed in) ( URL_1 ) which take a longer time than high pressure mercury that get used in stage and studio and projector lamps. ( URL_0 ) For traditional incandescent lamps, all you need to do is heat up the metal in the filament, and it's the direct glow of the metal that makes light. It just takes a fraction of a second for the metal to heat up. Neon is just the energy flowing between an anode and cathode through neon gas, which glows, sort of like mercury vapour, but there's nothing that needs to melt, so it can happen pretty quickly. Fluorescent lamps are similar to Neon, but the energy by itself doesn't make light - it just excites the phosphors on the inside of the tube, which glow. Older ones do take a second or so to get to the point where the phosphors are glowing fully, but it's pretty quick. As far as I can tell, LEDs work by magic, so I can't tell you how those work.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 44.24, 'recall': 26.45, 'fmeasure': 33.1}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 4.17, 'recall': 2.49, 'fmeasure': 3.11}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 21.2, 'recall': 12.67, 'fmeasure': 15.86}}"
Why do so many passenger planes use the Deakin method (dragging the nose and then lifting off suddenly) instead of allowing the plane to naturally lift off and having a slower initial climb?,The Deakin method is used for a couple of reasons: 1) It allows the pilot to take off at a lower speed. This means that the pilot has more control over the aircraft during takeoff and it makes it easier to avoid obstacles or other aircraft. 2) It allows the pilot to take off from a longer runway. This means that the pilot has more room to maneuver during takeoff. 3) It allows the pilot to take off in a shorter distance. This means that the pilot has more control over the aircraft during takeoff. 4) It allows the pilot to take off at a higher angle of attack. This means that the pilot can take off faster and from a shorter distance. 5) It allows the pilot to take off at a lower angle of attack. This means that the pilot has more control over the aircraft during takeoff. 6) It allows the pilot to take off with less power. This means that the pilot can take off from a shorter distance and with less power. 7) It allows the pilot to take off with more power. This means that the pilot can take off from a longer distance and with more power. 8) It allows the pilot to take off with more control. This means that the pilot has more control over the aircraft during takeoff.  ,"Noise abatement, mostly. Long, slow climbs over populated areas tend to piss off the whiny bitches who moved in next to the airport and then complain about the jet noise. Just look at what the planes do at John Wayne (SNA). Line up and wait, lock the brakes, stomp on the gas and wait for clearance, then release the brakes and go hurling down the runway. At speed, yank back on the yoke and climb at 20-25 degrees nose up. All so you don't piss off the princesses in Newport Beach. It's also a matter of getting the planes up into the thinner air at the flight levels so they don't burn quite so much gas pushing through the lower, thicker air.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 14.91, 'recall': 26.98, 'fmeasure': 19.21}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.0, 'recall': 0.0, 'fmeasure': 0.0}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 9.65, 'recall': 17.46, 'fmeasure': 12.43}}"
When locksmiths started producing keys on a large scale for public consumption how did they make them different enough to only open one lock but not change them so much that they would eventually run out of key designs?,"( URL_0 ) & #x200B; > I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""different enough."" There are many different types of locks, but they all have the same basic mechanism. So you can make a key that works on any lock if you know how the mechanism works.  ","Locks don't *need* to be totally unique. If you have a few hundred different combinations, that's good enough to stop anyone from accidentally getting into the wrong door with their key. Anyone who wants to make all possible keys would be better served by picking a lock or just breaking down the door. OK, so your basic lock has inside of it a series of spring-loaded pins in a line going back from the key-hole. Each pin can be pushed up to varying heights by the teeth of a key. If you look at a key, the 'divots' on the key are where the pins rest, and you can see that some are higher and others are lower. So let's consider a basic five-pin lock, where each pin has up to five positions. We can think of this like a number puzzle; let's say a lock opens with the pins in the following order: 4,2,4,3,1 Just looking at that, and knowing that each pin has five possible heights, we can estimate there are several **thousand** possible combinations. (1,1,1,1,1 to 5,5,5,5,5) So the odds of one key working in a different lock would be less than 1/10th of 1%.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 52.08, 'recall': 11.47, 'fmeasure': 18.8}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 8.51, 'recall': 1.84, 'fmeasure': 3.03}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 25.0, 'recall': 5.5, 'fmeasure': 9.02}}"
How solar panels work,"Solar panels are made of photovoltaic cells, which are essentially electronic devices that convert sunlight into electricity. These cells are made of semiconductor materials, like silicon. When sunlight hits the cells, it knocks electrons loose from the atoms, and these electrons are able to flow through the material, creating a current. This current is then sent through an inverter, which converts the DC power from the solar panels into AC power that can be used in the home. The inverter also has a built-in battery backup, which stores excess energy during the day and releases it at night.","2 layers of silicon crystals are laid on top of each other. One layer likes having extra electrons, the other layer likes giving up electrons. The sun's energy bounces electrons all over but in general they move towards the top layer causing a negative charge to build up and since it took those from the bottom, the bottom is positively charged. At that point its like a weak battery and just needs some metal leads to go to a motor our light or DC to AC inverter.","{'rouge1': {'precision': 28.28, 'recall': 31.82, 'fmeasure': 29.95}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 1.02, 'recall': 1.15, 'fmeasure': 1.08}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 15.15, 'recall': 17.05, 'fmeasure': 16.04}}"
"How do Maglev trains compare to regular trains? And, why is one preferred over another?","  x200B; Maglev trains use magnetic levitation, which means that the train floats above the tracks. This allows the train to be more efficient and use less energy. The train is able to float above the tracks because of the magnetic field created by the train. The train has magnets on the bottom and the tracks have magnets on the top. This allows the train to float above the tracks. The train also has a magnetic field created by the train, which helps the train to stay on the track. This makes it easier for the train to go faster.  x200B; Regular trains are just like cars, they are on wheels. This means that the train needs to use energy to push the wheels, which is why they are not as efficient as Maglev trains. The energy needed to push the wheels also means that the train needs to use more energy to go faster.  x000B;  x200B; There are two types of Maglev trains. One is the Electromagnetic Suspension (EMS) and the other is the Electromagnetic Propulsion (EMP). EMS is the most common Maglev train. The train uses the magnetic field created by the train to keep the train floating above the tracks. EMP is the newest Maglev train. It uses the magnetic field created by the train to push the train.  ",Maglev (magnetic levitation) is needed if you want to go much faster than conventional trains. Conventional rails expand when heated and they move when driven over. That limits the safe speed. Maglev is much more expensive.,"{'rouge1': {'precision': 7.24, 'recall': 44.44, 'fmeasure': 12.45}, 'rouge2': {'precision': 0.91, 'recall': 5.71, 'fmeasure': 1.57}, 'rougeL': {'precision': 5.88, 'recall': 36.11, 'fmeasure': 10.12}}"

With that said, the electronic chip is the real blocker, there are trillions of combinations there. They don't Sometimes keys for a certain car type will open a cars of the same make and model.
