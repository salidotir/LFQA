Women are automatically perceived as peaceful nurturers where as men are aggressive physicals. 2. Children are less likely to call abuse against female family members as they are less likely to be believed. 3. Female abuse is (wrongly) perceived in many cases as being invited especially where the victim is slightly older i.e. Boys must like it right. This is the one cultural aspect I hate the most because a male teacher/person in trust (for example) is automatically in the wrong and a female teacher is more likely to go free / have no charges / have no abuse claim made. Don't get me wrong - male abusers are still the largest statistic but to deny there is an issue with female abuse harms the ability of our children to come forward.\n----------------\nTrue Answer 1:\n It isn't more common in men. Men are just punished much more severely and much more often than women are. If you have a male teacher aged 35 who has sex with a student aged 13, he's lucky if he survives to go to jail because of the lynch mob. Genders are reversed and people make fun of the 13 year old boy if he objects and talk about how lucky he is and all that stuff.\n----------------\nTrue Answer 2:\n Basing your conclusions on the people convicted is going to lead to a very skewed image and has various flaws - Not all people convicted for child sex abuse are pedophiles (yes, there is a distinction and children can get abused by people who are not specifically pedophiles). Additionally, not all people who commit child sex abuse are convicted. - Not all pedophiles abuse children. There is also a group that manages to control their impulses and seeing that just having thoughts is not illegal, these people don't end up in jail and don't end up in your statistics - It's documented that for a good number of crimes, women often get less punishment than men. When it gets to these sort of crimes, women do more often end up not being prosecuted (or even investigated) than men. So there is another thing that will skew your statistics. The fact is that it is incredibly hard for us to really know if it is true that the majority of pedophiles are men because pretty much every way we have of collecting data on this subject is pretty flawed (conviction statistics obviously don't work, self reported statistics are usually skewed as well). Then, even if we do end up with data that more men are pedophiles, it's still harder to determine if this is due to some biologic reason or if there is societal reasons for why we measure what we measure (for example, could it be that due to our tendency to look at men with more distrust when it comes to children, we are pretty good at spotting male pedophiles, but completely overlook female ones)\n----------------\nTrue Answer 3:\n Because female abusers are often unreported or for the most part disregarded. I see constant stories of teachers having relations with younger boys and people just kind of shrug it off and even joke about it. Women are also naturally perceived as nurturing. If you ever see those health class videos they also always, and I mean always, depict someone like the weird uncle or father as the abuser, never the aunt. Stereotypes and gender roles often make women less suceptable to being arrested as well as discouraging victims from coming out.\n----------------\nTrue Answer 4:\n It isn't. Haven't you seen all the grown women at concerts for the Justin Beiber when he was underage or those other teeny popper bands.\n----------------\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Testing2","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"question_index_to_ask = 1\n\n\nprompt = validation_dataset['title'][question_index_to_ask]\ninput_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\", truncation=True).input_ids.cuda()\noutputs = new_model.generate(input_ids=input_ids,\n                         max_new_tokens=150,\n                        #  do_sample=True,\n                        #  top_p=0.9,\n                         temperature=0.2)\nresult = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs.detach().cpu().numpy(), skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\nprint(result)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-22T19:54:32.519652Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-22T19:54:32.519984Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-22T19:54:42.464455Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-22T19:54:32.519948Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-22T19:54:42.463427Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Why is it okay to make fun of people who are from the southern United States?\nЪ\n\nAnswer:\nIt's not okay to make fun of people from any place.
